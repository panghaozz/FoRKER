The claim mentions a company that is not planning new measures for a major video platform in the next six months. The context in paragraph 0 states that \"Google\u2019s report states it has no additional measures planned for YouTube.\" This indicates that Google is indeed the company that fits this part of the claim.\n\n2. The claim states that this company secures default search engine positions through deals with other tech giants. In paragraph 1, it is highlighted that \"The Justice Department is focused on the deals Google makes \u2014 with Apple but also with Samsung and Mozilla and many others \u2014 to ensure it is the default search engine on practically every platform.\" This confirms that Google secures its position as the default search engine through partnerships.\n\n3. The claim also specifies that the company is accused of harming news publishers' revenue through anticompetitive practices. In paragraph 3, it mentions a class action antitrust suit filed against Google, which states that Google \"siphons off\" news publishers\u2019 content and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. \n\nOverall, all aspects of the claim are supported by the information found in the context, leading to the conclusion that the company in question is Google.", "EM pro correct": "True", "EM correct": "True"}

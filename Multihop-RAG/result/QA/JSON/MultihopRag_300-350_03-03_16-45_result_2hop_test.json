The failure occurred because the reasoning process did not consider the lack of relevant information in the contexts and made an assumption that the information was present. To mitigate similar failures, the plan is to carefully analyze the supporting contexts and identify any gaps in information that may prevent a definitive answer. If there is insufficient evidence, the reasoning should acknowledge the lack of information and provide a response based on that. "}

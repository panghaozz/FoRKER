Right Answer:no

Answer: The TechCrunch article indicated that Google did not release the full Gemini Ultra model, only a "lite" version called Gemini Pro, which contradicts the claim that the release was comprehensive and on par with the full model. The other TechCrunch article and The Age article both imply misconduct by Google, with the former accusing Google of anticompetitive behavior towards news publishers and the latter suggesting a general acceptance of foul play allegations against Google. Therefore, the claim is partially correct but misrepresents the TechCrunch article's stance on the Gemini Pro model.

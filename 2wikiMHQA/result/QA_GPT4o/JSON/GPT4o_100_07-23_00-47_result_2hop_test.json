He is best known for films such as \"Eraserhead\" (1977), \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) and \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), often regarded by critics as among the best films of their respective decades, and for his successful 1990\u201391 television series \"Twin Peaks\", which led to him being labeled \"the first popular Surrealist\" by noted film critic Pauline Kael. A recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019, he has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and has won France\\'s C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d\\'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. He has been described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the most important director of this era\", while AllMovie called him \"the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking\". Born to a middle-class family in Missoula, Montana, Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States before he studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. He moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film \"Eraserhead\" (1977). After \"Eraserhead\" became a success on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct the biographical film \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. He was then employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic \"Dune\" (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir mystery film \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), which stirred controversy over its violence but later grew in critical reputation. Next, Lynch created his own television series with Mark Frost, the popular murder mystery entitled \"Twin Peaks\" (1990\u20131991). He also created a cinematic prequel,  (1992), a road film \"Wild at Heart\" (1990) and a family film \"The Straight Story\" (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic non-linear narrative structures: \"Lost Highway\" (1997), \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), and \"Inland Empire\" (2006). Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the Internet as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated \"DumbLand\" (2002) and the surreal sitcom \"Rabbits\" (2002). Lynch and Frost reunited for a third season of \"Twin Peaks\", airing in on Showtime in 2017. Lynch co-wrote and directed every episode, as well as reprising his role as Gordon Cole. Lynch\\'s other artistic endeavours include: his work as a musician, encompassing three studio albums\u2014\"BlueBOB\" (2001), \"Crazy Clown Time\" (2011) and \"The Big Dream\" ( 2013)\u2014as well as music and sound design for a variety of his films; painting and photography; writing three books\u2014\"Images\" (1994), \"Catching the Big Fish\" (2006), and \"Room to Dream\" (2018); and directing several music videos and advertisements, including the Dior promotional film \"Lady Blue Shanghai\" (2006).

He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV. He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians. Antiochus IX was killed in 95BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half-brother and rival Antiochus VIII. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed. Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts. AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII. The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE (89/88BC). The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated. Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians. Numismatic evidence shows that AntiochusX was succeeded in Antioch by Demetrius III, who controlled the capital in SE (88/87 BC).\"}, {'idx': 6, 'title': 'Laodice of the Sameans', 'paragraph_text': 'Laodice was a Queen of an unknown Kingdom in Asia.

In her teens Victoria fell in love with her maternal first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia, but the disapprobation of marriage between first cousins of his faith, Orthodox Christianity, discouraged their romance. Bowing to family pressure, Victoria married her paternal first cousin, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine in 1894, following the wishes of their grandmother, Queen Victoria. Their marriage was a failure. Victoria scandalized the royal families of Europe when she divorced her husband in 1901.

Instead, Sheppard became a courtier. He was introduced to Nell Gwynn and became one of her favourite companions, along with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst (later Earl of Dorset). He would remain one of Dorset\\'s closest friends throughout his life.

When Charles II died, Sheppard went into retirement. However, when William came to the throne, Sheppard was back at court and back in favour. Dorset was made the chamberlain of the royal household, and that gave him a great many places to dispense in patronage. For this, he employed Sheppard. Sheppard received the proceeds from those wishing to purchase places, and he received the favours of those wishing a good word to be placed on their behalf. At the same time, Sheppard was a favourite of the new Queen\\'s, and John Oldmixon said that he made the Queen \"very merry.\" In \"A New Way of Selling Places at Court\" in 1712, Jonathan Swift would say that Fleetwood Sheppard sold places that did not exist and named successors for posts that were not vacant, that he enriched himself greatly. In 1690 he was made a gentleman usher to the king. In 1694 he was knighted, became a gentleman usher to the black rod in the House of Lords, and was inducted as a knight of the garter. Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others. He was one of the ones, for example, who \"discoveredParadise Lost\" when Buckhurst bought it from a small stall at a fair. He was also present when Matthew Prior was discovered reading Horace as a tap puller in a bar and sent to school to cultivate his talents. He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon. He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change.

He was stabbed beneath the eye while separating Henry Bulkeley and George Etheridge in a quarrel in a tavern. Sheppard was not liked by James II, and Sheppard did not like James, either. When Charles II died, Sheppard went into retirement. However, when William came to the throne, Sheppard was back at court and back in favour. Dorset was made the chamberlain of the royal household, and that gave him a great many places to dispense in patronage. For this, he employed Sheppard. Sheppard received the proceeds from those wishing to purchase places, and he received the favours of those wishing a good word to be placed on their behalf. At the same time, Sheppard was a favourite of the new Queen\\'s, and John Oldmixon said that he made the Queen \"very merry.\" In \"A New Way of Selling Places at Court\" in 1712, Jonathan Swift would say that Fleetwood Sheppard sold places that did not exist and named successors for posts that were not vacant, that he enriched himself greatly. In 1690 he was made a gentleman usher to the king. In 1694 he was knighted, became a gentleman usher to the black rod in the House of Lords, and was inducted as a knight of the garter. Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others. He was one of the ones, for example, who \"discoveredParadise Lost\" when Buckhurst bought it from a small stall at a fair. He was also present when Matthew Prior was discovered reading Horace as a tap puller in a bar and sent to school to cultivate his talents. He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon. He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change. Charles Gildon, Thomas Rymer, and John Dennis dedicated volumes of literary criticism to Sheppard, and John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester regarded Sheppard as the only critic he needed for his verses. In his last years, Sheppard was reported dead several times before he died. In 1694, Lord Godolphin heard a report that Sheppard had died, but Sheppard himself responded, saying that he was alive, but that he had suffered from \"the stone\" for twelve to fourteen years. In December 1697, he was again reported as dead. In July 1698, he was \"again\" reported as dead. He did die shortly afterward, but in 1768 a joking \"Annual Register\" announced that Sheppard was still alive, in good health, and 120 years old.'}]", "processed context": "[{'idx': 1, 'title': 'Fleetwood Sheppard', 'paragraph_text': \"(Fleetwood Sheppard), (Fleetwood Sheppard), (Shepphard,Sheppheard), (Sheppeard), (1 January 1634), (25 August 1698), (British), (Charles II), (England), (William of Orange), (the 1680s and 1690s), (Oxfordshire), (Magdalen Hall), (Oxford), (the Bachelor of Arts), (1654), (1657), (M.A.), (the Church of England), (Charles), (Sheppard), (Gray's Inn), (Nell Gwynn), (Charles Sackville), (Dorset), (Anthony \u00e1 Wood), (Sheppard), (Charles II's), (Nell Gwynn), (Gwynn), (Sheppard), (Paris), (Dorset), (Sheppard), (Dorset), (Paris), (Sheppard), (Henry Bulkeley), (George Etheridge), (James II), (Sheppard), (James), (Charles II), (William), (Sheppard), (Sheppard), (Sheppard), (Queen), (John Oldmixon), (A New Way of Selling Places at Court), (1712), (Jonathan Swift), (Fleetwood Sheppard), (1690), (1694), (the House of Lords), (discoveredParadise Lost), (Buckhurst), (Matthew Prior), (Horace), (Robert Gould), (John Oldmixon), (Puritan), (around 1695), (Charles Gildon), (Thomas Rymer), (John Dennis), (Sheppard), (John Wilmot), (2nd Earl), (Rochester), (Sheppard), (his last years), (Sheppard), (1694), (Sheppard), (Sheppard), (twelve to fourteen years), (December 1697), (July 1698), (1768), (Annual Register), (Sheppard), (120 years old)\"}, {'idx': 0, 'title': 'George William Whitaker', 'paragraph_text': '(George William Whitaker), (September 25, 1840 \u2013 March 6, 1916), (Rhode Island), (the late 19th), (early 20th century), (Dean of Providence), (Dean of Rhode Island Artists)'}, {'idx': 1, 'title': 'Fleetwood Sheppard', 'paragraph_text': \"(Fleetwood Sheppard), (Fleetwood Sheppard), (Shepphard,Sheppheard), (Sheppeard), (1 January 1634), (25 August 1698), (British), (Charles II), (England), (William of Orange), (the 1680s and 1690s), (Oxfordshire), (Magdalen Hall), (Oxford), (the Bachelor of Arts), (1654), (1657), (M.A.), (the Church of England), (Charles), (Sheppard), (Gray's Inn), (Nell Gwynn), (Charles Sackville), (Dorset), (Anthony \u00e1 Wood), (Sheppard), (Charles II's), (Nell Gwynn), (Gwynn), (Sheppard), (Paris), (Dorset), (Sheppard), (Dorset), (Paris), (Sheppard), (Henry Bulkeley), (George Etheridge), (James II), (Sheppard), (James), (Charles II), (William), (Sheppard), (Sheppard), (Sheppard), (Queen), (John Oldmixon), (A New Way of Selling Places at Court), (1712), (Jonathan Swift), (Fleetwood Sheppard), (1690), (1694), (the House of Lords), (discoveredParadise Lost), (Buckhurst), (Matthew Prior), (Horace), (Robert Gould), (John Oldmixon), (Puritan), (around 1695), (Charles Gildon), (Thomas Rymer), (John Dennis), (Sheppard), (John Wilmot), (2nd Earl), (Rochester), (Sheppard), (his last years), (Sheppard), (1694), (Sheppard), (Sheppard), (twelve to fourteen years), (December 1697), (July 1698), (1768), (Annual Register), (Sheppard), (120 years old)\"}]", "answer": " Fleetwood Sheppard", "isRef": false, "EM pro correct": "True", "EM correct": "True"}

He was the first monarch of France from the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. He was assassinated in 1610 by Fran\u00e7ois Ravaillac, a fanatical Catholic, and was succeeded by his son Louis XIII. The son of Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00f4me and Jeanne d\\'Albret, the Queen of Navarre, Henry was baptised as a Catholic but raised in the Protestant faith by his mother. He inherited the throne of Navarre in 1572 on his mother\\'s death. As a Huguenot, Henry was involved in the French Wars of Religion, barely escaping assassination in the St. Bartholomew\\'s Day massacre. He later led Protestant forces against the royal army.

Henry III belonged to the House of Valois, descended from Philip III of France, elder son of Saint Louis; Henry IV belonged to the House of Bourbon, descended from Robert, Count of Clermont, younger son of Saint Louis. As Head of the House of Bourbon, Henry was \"first prince of the blood\". Upon the death of his brother-in-law and distant cousin Henry III in 1589, Henry was called to the French succession by the Salic law. He initially kept the Protestant faith (the only French king to do so) and had to fight against the Catholic League, which denied that he could wear France\\'s crown as a Protestant. To obtain mastery over his kingdom, after four years of stalemate, he found it prudent to abjure the Calvinist faith. As a pragmatic politician (in the parlance of the time, a \"politique\"), he displayed an unusual religious tolerance for the era. Notably, he promulgated the Edict of Nantes (1598), which guaranteed religious liberties to Protestants, thereby effectively ending the Wars of Religion. Considered a usurper by some Catholics and a traitor by some Protestants, Henry became target of at least 12 assassination attempts.

His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist. Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group\\'s de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Starting in 1967, Lennon\\'s lyrics began to espouse a pacifist message, and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. From 1968 to 1972, he produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", and the international top 10 singles \"Give Peace a ChanceInstant Karma!Imagine\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\". Lennon was known for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism. After moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration \"Double Fantasy\".

It was well known that the union of France and Spain under one monarch would upset the balance of power in Europe, such that other European powers would take steps to prevent it. Indeed, Philip's accession in Spain provoked the 13-year War of the Spanish Succession, which continued until the Treaty of Utrecht forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish crowns while confirming his accession to the throne of Spain.

Juan Carlos is the grandson of Alfonso XIII, the last king of Spain before the abolition of the monarchy in 1931 and the subsequent declaration of the Second Spanish Republic. Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, during his family\\'s exile. \" General\u00edsimo\" Francisco Franco took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, yet in 1947 Spain\\'s status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. Juan Carlos\\'s father, Juan, was the third son of King Alfonso, who had renounced his claims to the throne in January 1941. Juan was seen by Franco to be too liberal and in 1969 was bypassed in favour of Juan Carlos as Franco\\'s successor as head of state. Juan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza. Later, he attended the Naval Military School, the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in Athens. The couple had two daughters and a son together: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe. Due to Franco\\'s declining health, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain\\'s head of state in the summer of 1974. Franco died in November the following year and Juan Carlos became king on 22 November 1975, two days after Franco\\'s death, the first reigning monarch since 1931; although his exiled father did not formally renounce his claims to the throne in favor of his son until 1977. Expected to continue Franco\\'s legacy, Juan Carlos, however, soon after his accession introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and begin the Spanish transition to democracy. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum, which re-established a constitutional monarchy. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert Spain to Francoist government in the King\\'s name.

The remaining four members recorded the band\\'s self-titled debut EP in 1997, before John Fulton replaced Brantley for the subsequent tour and 1998\\'s \"Under the Running Board\". Shortly after the second EP\\'s release, Fulton left the band due to \"creative differences\", and in early 1999 Doll was forced to cease involvement due to a spinal injury suffered in a road traffic accident. As a result, Weinman performed all guitars and bass on the band\\'s full-length debut album \"Calculating Infinity\", released in 1999. Following the release of \"Calculating Infinity\", Brian Benoit replaced Fulton and Jeff Wood took Doll\\'s place; Wood left the band in 2000 due to the ongoing effects of a gunshot wound to the head sustained in 1992, and was replaced by Liam Wilson. In April 2001, it was announced that Minakakis had decided to leave The Dillinger Escape Plan to pursue \"non-music related endeavors\", with the band briefly placed on hiatus. The vocalist was replaced later in the year by Greg Puciato, who was chosen from \"over one hundred\" singers who auditioned by submitting a recording of \"43% Burnt\" to the band. In between the departure of Minakakis and the addition of Puciato, the band recorded the EP \"Irony Is a Dead Scene\" with Faith No More and Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, which was released in 2002. In 2004, the band released its first album with Puciato on vocals, \"Miss Machine\". Later in the year, Benoit suffered nerve damage in his left hand which affected his ability to play guitar; after attempting to continue, he was forced to leave the band in April 2005 and was replaced by James Love. During a tour in 2006, tensions arose between Weinman and Pennie, with the guitarist briefly leaving the band citing \"undisclosed personal reasons\". Pennie eventually left the band in 2007 to join Coheed and Cambria, with Gil Sharone replacing him for the band\\'s third album \"Ire Works\". Also in 2007, guitarist Jeff Tuttle was added to the band due to Love\\'s unavailability. By the beginning of 2009, Sharone had left the band and been replaced by Billy Rymer. \" Option Paralysis\" was released in 2010, which marked Tuttle\\'s first contribution to the band (he performed additional vocals, with Weinman recording all guitars). The guitarist later left the band in August 2012 to attend film school. Love rejoined the band as Tuttle\\'s replacement, although was not featured on the 2013 album \" One of Us Is the Killer\".

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby\\'s mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d\\'origineluogo d\\'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother\\'s or father\\'s place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder\\'s place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby\\'s parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant\\'s\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant\\'s\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

He was one of the first patroons, but the only one to become successful. He founded the Manor of Rensselaerswyck in what is now mainly New York\\'s Capital District. His estate remained throughout the Dutch and British colonial era and the American Revolution as a legal entity until the 1840s. Eventually, that came to an end during the Anti-Rent War. Van Rensselaer was the son of Hendrick Kiliaensz van Rensselaer, a soldier from Nijkerk in the \"States army of the duke of Upper Saxony\", and Maria Pafraet, descendant of a well-known printers\\' dynasty. To keep from risking his life in the army like his father, he apprenticed under his uncle, a successful Amsterdam jeweler.

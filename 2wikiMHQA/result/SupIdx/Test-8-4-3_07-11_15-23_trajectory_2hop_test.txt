Question:Who is the mother of the director of film Polish-Russian War (Film)?
golden idx: [4, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 
1. Context idx 7: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions Xawery Żuławski and his mother Małgorzata Braunek, which are both entities in the reasoning steps. 
2. Context idx 4: This context is relevant as it mentions the film "Polish-Russian War" and the director Xawery Żuławski. It is likely to contain information about his mother since it discusses his professional background.
3. Context idx 0: Although this context does not directly relate to the claim, it mentions a film and could potentially contain information about other film-related personnel, making it somewhat relevant.
4. Context idx 9: This context mentions a film and an actress, which makes it slightly relevant, but it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim than contexts that mention Xawery Żuławski or the film "Polish-Russian War."
5. Context idx 1: This context is about a Russian general and conductor, which is not directly related to the claim but could be tangentially related to the film industry.
6. Context idx 2: This context is about an American actress and her work in films, which is not directly related to the claim but is within the film industry.
7. Context idx 5: This context is about a Christmas special unrelated to the claim but is within the realm of film and television.
8. Context idx 6: This context is about a film featuring the Three Stooges, which is not directly related to the claim but is within the film industry.
The remaining contexts (idx 3 and 8) are not related to the film industry or the entities mentioned in the reasoning steps and are therefore ranked lower.
idx: [7, 4, 0, 9, 1, 2, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 1. Context idx 7: This context directly mentions Xawery Żuławski and provides information about his mother, Małgorzata Braunek, which is exactly what the claim is asking for. It is highly relevant and informative. 2. Context idx 4: This context mentions the film "Polish-Russian War" and the director Xawery Żuławski, which is related to the claim but does not mention his mother. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer compared to idx 7. 3. Context idx 0, 9, 1, 2, 5, 6: None of these contexts mention Xawery Żuławski or his mother, Małgorzata Braunek, and are therefore not relevant to the claim. They are unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [7, 4, 0, 9]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 7: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Xawery Żuławski and directly states that he is the son of Małgorzata Braunek, which answers the claim. 2. Context idx 4: This context is relevant because it confirms that Xawery Żuławski directed the film 'Polish-Russian War', but it does not mention his mother. 3. Context idx 0 and idx 9: These contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Xawery Żuławski or his mother.

Question:Which film came out first, Blind Shaft or The Mask Of Fu Manchu?
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: To determine which film came out first, we need to compare the publication dates provided in the reasoning steps. The reasoning steps indicate that "Blind Shaft" was published in 2003 and "The Mask of Fu Manchu" was published in 1932. Therefore, we need to rank the contexts based on how well they match these entities and dates, their relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 2 ("The Mask of Fu Manchu"): This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the film "The Mask of Fu Manchu" and its publication date of 1932, which matches one of the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 0 ("Blind Shaft"): This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions the film "Blind Shaft" and its publication date of 2003, which matches the other reasoning step.
3. Context idx 1 ("The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu"): This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions a Fu Manchu film from 1929, which is close to the date mentioned in the reasoning steps for "The Mask of Fu Manchu."
4. Context idx 9 ("The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu"): This context is relevant as it mentions a Fu Manchu film from 1930, which is close to the date mentioned in the reasoning steps for "The Mask of Fu Manchu."
5. Context idx 3 ("The Castle of Fu Manchu"): This context is less relevant as it mentions a Fu Manchu film from 1969, which is not directly related to the claim but is part of the Fu Manchu series.
6. Context idx 4 ("The Brides of Fu Manchu"): This context is less relevant as it mentions a Fu Manchu film from 1966, which is not directly related to the claim but is part of the Fu Manchu series.
7. Context idx 6 ("The Face of Fu Manchu"): This context is less relevant as it mentions a Fu Manchu film from 1965, which is not directly related to the claim but is part of the Fu Manchu series.
8. Context idx 8 ("The Blood of Fu Manchu"): This context is less relevant as it mentions a Fu Manchu film from 1968, which is not directly related to the claim but is part of the Fu Manchu series.

The remaining contexts are not directly related to the films in question and therefore are not included in the top 8 ranked contexts.

idx: [2, 0, 1, 9, 3, 4, 6, 8]

step-by-step think:
1. "Blind Shaft" context: This context directly relates to the claim as it mentions "Blind Shaft" and provides information about its publication date. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. "The Mask of Fu Manchu" context: This context directly mentions "The Mask of Fu Manchu," which is part of the claim. It provides information about the film, its director, and publication date. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. "The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu" context: Although it mentions "Fu Manchu," it is not specifically about the film mentioned in the claim. It provides information about a different film in the same franchise. It might not be as relevant or likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts directly related to the claim.
4. "The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu" context: Although it mentions "Fu Manchu," it is not specifically about the film mentioned in the claim. It provides information about a different film in the same franchise. It might not be as relevant or likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts directly related to the claim.

idx: [0, 2, 9, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "The Mask of Fu Manchu" context: This context directly relates to the claim as it mentions "The Mask of Fu Manchu" and provides the publication date of 1932, which is one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Blind Shaft" context: This context directly mentions "Blind Shaft" and provides the publication date of 2003, which is the other reasoning step. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu" context: Although this context is about a different Fu Manchu film, it provides a publication date of 1929, which is close to the date mentioned in the reasoning steps. It might not be as relevant or likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts directly related to the claim, but it is more relevant than the remaining context. 4. "The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu" context: This context provides information about another Fu Manchu film with a publication date of 1930. It is informative but less relevant to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention the films in question.

Question:When did John V, Prince Of Anhalt-Zerbst's father die?
golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the death date of John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst's father, Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. The reasoning steps provided are directly related to Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and his date of death, which is 12 June 1516. Therefore, the context that mentions Ernest I and his date of death will be ranked highest. 
1. Context idx 7: This context is directly about Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and mentions his date of death, matching perfectly with the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 6: This context mentions John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, and his relation to Ernest I, making it highly relevant.
3. Context idx 1: This context mentions John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, but does not mention Ernest I or the date of death, making it less relevant than idx 7 and 6.
4. Context idx 9: This context mentions John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, but like idx 1, it does not mention Ernest I or the date of death.
5. Context idx 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8: These contexts mention other princes of Anhalt-Zerbst and do not provide information about Ernest I or his date of death, making them less relevant to the claim.
idx: [7,6,1,9,0,2,3,4]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst's father's death date. 1. Context idx 7: This context directly mentions Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, and provides the exact date of his death, which is the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 6: This context is about John V and mentions his father Ernest I, making it relevant, but it does not provide the death date. 3. Context idx 1: This context is about Bernhard VII, who is related to John V, but it does not mention Ernest I or his death date. 4. Context idx 9: This context is about Karl I, who is related to John V, but again, it does not mention Ernest I or his death date. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention Ernest I or the relationship to John V.
idx: [7, 6, 1, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with idx 7: This context directly mentions "Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau" and provides the exact date of death, which is the answer to the claim. It is highly relevant and informative. 2. Context with idx 6: This context mentions "John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst" and his relation to "Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau," which is directly related to the claim. It is relevant but does not provide the date of death. 3. Context with idx 9: This context mentions "Karl I, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst," who is related to "John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst," and by extension to "Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau." It is less directly related to the claim than the previous contexts but still relevant. 4. Context with idx 1: This context mentions "Bernhard VII, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst," another relative, but is the least directly related to the claim and does not mention the date of death.

golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the birthplace of David Lynch, the director of the film "Ronnie Rocket". The reasoning steps provided are 'Ronnie Rocket director David Lynch', 'David Lynch place of birth Missoula, Montana'. Therefore, the contexts need to be ranked based on how well they match these entities and relationships, their relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer.

1. Context 6 is the most relevant as it directly mentions David Lynch, his work, and his place of birth, Missoula, Montana.
2. Context 7 is relevant because it discusses the film "Ronnie Rocket" and David Lynch's involvement with it, which is closely related to the claim.
3. Context 2 mentions a director who has worked in the United States, but it does not provide information about David Lynch or "Ronnie Rocket".
4. Context 3 also mentions a director working in the United States and has some relevance due to the mention of the art direction, which could be tangentially related to David Lynch's work.

6. Context 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9 are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention David Lynch or "Ronnie Rocket".

Based on the rules for ranking, the contexts are ranked as follows:

step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandfather of Charles Bretagne Marie De La Trémoille, we need to find the father of his father. The reasoning steps provided are: 1. Charles Bretagne Marie de La Trémoille's father is Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille. 2. Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille's father is Charles Armand René de La Trémoille. Therefore, we are looking for contexts that mention these individuals and their relationships. The context with the title 'Charles Armand René de La Trémoille' directly mentions him as the father of Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille, making it highly relevant. The context titled 'Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille' also mentions the relationship between Jean Bretagne Charles and his father, Charles Armand René, confirming the lineage. The context titled 'Charles Bretagne Marie de La Trémoille' is relevant as it mentions the individual in question but does not mention his paternal grandfather. Other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the direct lineage or are too far removed from the immediate family line in question.
idx: [0, 5, 1, 2, 6, 3, 8, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine Charles Bretagne Marie De La Trémoille's paternal grandfather, we need to trace his lineage. The reasoning steps provided are: 1. Charles Bretagne Marie de La Trémoille's father is Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille. 2. Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille's father is Charles Armand René de La Trémoille. Therefore, the paternal grandfather is Charles Armand René de La Trémoille. Now, let's rank the contexts based on the relevance to the claim and the reasoning steps:

2. Context idx 0: This context is about Charles Armand René de La Trémoille, the paternal grandfather according to the reasoning steps, making it highly relevant.
3. Context idx 1: This context mentions Charles Bretagne Marie de La Trémoille and his father, Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille, linking to the first reasoning step.
4. Context idx 2: This context is about Henri Charles de La Trémoille, who is not directly mentioned in the reasoning steps but is related to the family lineage and could provide additional background information.
The other contexts are less relevant as they do not directly address the claim or the entities mentioned in the reasoning steps.
idx: [5, 0, 1, 2]

step-by-step think: The claim requires identifying the paternal grandfather of Charles Bretagne Marie de La Trémoille. According to the reasoning steps, we need to find the father of Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille, who is Charles Armand René de La Trémoille.

Question:Are North Marion High School (Oregon) and Seoul High School both located in the same country?
golden idx: [7, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, I need to find contexts that mention either North Marion High School (Oregon) or Seoul High School and their respective countries. 1. Context 9 is the most relevant as it directly mentions North Marion High School (Oregon) and provides location details. 2. Context 7 is the second most relevant because it directly mentions Seoul High School and its location in South Korea. 3. Context 3 mentions Creswell High School in Oregon, which is relevant due to the proximity to North Marion High School (Oregon). 4. Context 1 mentions Marion High School in Kansas, USA, which could be confused with North Marion High School (Oregon) due to the similar name. 5. Context 2 mentions North Marion High School in West Virginia, which is less relevant but shares part of the name with the school in question. 6. Context 8 mentions Marion High School in Indiana, which is less relevant but could be confused with North Marion High School (Oregon). 7. Context 0, 4, 5, and 6 do not mention either of the schools or their locations and are therefore the least relevant.
idx: [9, 7, 3, 1, 2, 8, 0, 4]

step-by-step think: To address the claim, I need to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and their relevance to the claim. The reasoning steps indicate that North Marion High School (Oregon) is in the United States and Seoul High School is in South Korea. Therefore, I will rank the contexts as follows:
1. Context idx 9: This context is about North Marion High School (Oregon) and confirms its location in the United States, directly matching one of the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 7: This context is about Seoul High School and confirms its location in South Korea, directly matching the other reasoning step.
3. Context idx 3: This context is about Creswell High School (Oregon), which is also in the United States. It is relevant because it shares the state with North Marion High School, but it does not directly address the claim.
4. Context idx 2: This context is about North Marion High School (West Virginia), which is in the United States. It is relevant due to the partial match with the name of the school in the claim, but it does not directly address the claim.
The other contexts are less relevant as they do not pertain to either of the schools mentioned in the claim or are located in different states or countries.
idx: [9, 7, 3, 2]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 9: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "North Marion High School (Oregon)" and confirms its location in the United States, matching one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 7: This context is equally relevant because it directly mentions "Seoul High School" and confirms its location in South Korea, matching the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 3: This context mentions "Creswell High School (Oregon)" which is also located in the United States, making it somewhat relevant to the claim but not directly addressing the specific entities in question. 4. Context idx 2: This context is about "North Marion High School (West Virginia)" which is a different entity and does not match the reasoning steps related to the claim.

Question:Who is the maternal grandfather of Antiochus X Eusebes?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: To determine the maternal grandfather of Antiochus X Eusebes, we need to identify contexts that mention his mother, Cleopatra IV, and her father, Ptolemy IX Lathyros. Context 5 directly mentions Cleopatra IV and Ptolemy IX Lathyros, making it the most relevant. Context 3 mentions Antiochus X Eusebes and provides detailed information about his reign and family, which is highly relevant to the claim. Although context 6 mentions Laodice, who lived during the reign of Antiochus X Eusebes, it does not provide information on his maternal lineage. The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not mention the entities related to the claim.
idx: [5,3,6,0,1,2,4,7]

step-by-step think: To determine the maternal grandfather of Antiochus X Eusebes, we need to identify his mother and her father. The reasoning steps provided are 'Antiochus X Eusebes mother Cleopatra IV' and 'Cleopatra IV father Ptolemy IX Lathyros'. Therefore, we should look for contexts that mention these individuals and their relationships.
1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Cleopatra IV and her husband Ptolemy IX Lathyros, directly addressing the reasoning steps. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 3: This context mentions Antiochus X Eusebes and his possible mother Cleopatra IV, making it relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention Ptolemy IX Lathyros, so it is slightly less relevant than context idx 5.
3. Context idx 6: This context mentions Antiochus X Eusebes but does not provide information about his mother or maternal grandfather, making it less relevant than contexts idx 5 and 3.
4. The remaining contexts (idx 0, 1, 2, 4, 7) do not mention the entities related to the claim and are therefore not relevant.

It directly addresses the entities in the reasoning steps. 2.

However, it does not mention Ptolemy IX Lathyros. 3. Context idx 6: This context mentions Laodice who lived at the time of Antiochus X Eusebes, which provides some relevance but does not mention the family relations needed to answer the claim. 4.

Question:Where was the director of film Thomas Jefferson (Film) born?
golden idx: [4, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the birthplace of Ken Burns, the director of the film "Thomas Jefferson." The reasoning steps guide me to look for contexts that mention "Ken Burns" and his place of birth, "Brooklyn." Context 4 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Ken Burns and provides information about his work, which is closely related to the claim. Context 8 also mentions Ken Burns in relation to the film "Thomas Jefferson," making it the second most relevant. The other contexts are about different individuals with the last name Jefferson and do not pertain to Ken Burns or the film "Thomas Jefferson," thus scoring lower in relevance.
idx: [4, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 4 "Ken Burns": This context is highly relevant as it mentions Ken Burns and provides detailed information about his work and achievements, including a mention of "Brooklyn Bridge," which is closely related to the reasoning step mentioning his place of birth, Brooklyn. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 8 "Thomas Jefferson (film)": This context is directly related to the claim as it discusses the film "Thomas Jefferson" and its director, Ken Burns. However, it does not mention his place of birth, making it slightly less relevant than context idx 4. 3. Context idx 0 "Atiba Jefferson": This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different person who shares the last name but has no connection to Ken Burns or the film "Thomas Jefferson." 4. Context idx 1 "Richard H. Jefferson": Similar to idx 0, this context is about a different individual with the last name Jefferson and does not provide information related to the claim. The remaining contexts are also about different individuals with the last name Jefferson and do not contribute to answering the claim.
idx: [4, 8, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with index 4 is the most relevant as it mentions Ken Burns and includes a reference to "Brooklyn Bridge," which is closely related to the reasoning step mentioning "Ken Burns place of birth Brooklyn." This context is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context with index 8 is the second most relevant because it is about the "Thomas Jefferson (film)" directed by Ken Burns, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not mention Ken Burns' place of birth. 3. Contexts with index 0 and 1 are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Ken Burns or his place of birth. They are about different individuals with the last name Jefferson and do not provide information that would help answer the claim.

It provides information about their marriage and life, which is relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention the cause of Princess Victoria Melita's death, making it slightly less relevant than context idx 3. 3. Context idx 2: This context mentions Prince Karl of Leiningen, who is related to Princess Victoria Melita and Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich. It provides background information on the family but does not directly address the claim or the cause of death, making it less relevant than the first two contexts.

Question:Who died first, Fleetwood Sheppard or George William Whitaker?
golden idx: [0, 1]
step-by-step think: To determine who died first between Fleetwood Sheppard and George William Whitaker, we need to compare their dates of death. The context for Fleetwood Sheppard clearly states his date of death as 25 August 1698, which matches one of the reasoning steps. Similarly, the context for George William Whitaker states his date of death as March 6, 1916, which also matches the other reasoning step. Since the claim is about the order of their deaths, these two contexts are the most relevant and informative, and they directly answer the claim. The other contexts either refer to different individuals with similar names or do not provide death dates that are relevant to the claim. Therefore, they score lower in relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.
idx: [1, 0]

step-by-step think: To determine who died first between Fleetwood Sheppard and George William Whitaker, we need to compare their dates of death. The context for Fleetwood Sheppard clearly states his date of death as 25 August 1698, which matches one of the reasoning steps. Similarly, the context for George William Whitaker states his date of death as March 6, 1916, which also matches the other reasoning step. Since the claim is specifically about the dates of death of these two individuals, the contexts that provide this information are the most relevant and should be ranked highest. The other contexts either refer to different individuals with similar names or do not contain relevant information about the dates of death, making them less relevant to the claim.
idx: [1, 0]

step-by-step think: To determine who died first between Fleetwood Sheppard and George William Whitaker, we need to compare their dates of death. The context for Fleetwood Sheppard clearly states his date of death as 25 August 1698. The context for George William Whitaker states his date of death as March 6, 1916. Since the 17th century precedes the 20th century, Fleetwood Sheppard died well before George William Whitaker. Therefore, the context that provides the date of death for Fleetwood Sheppard is most relevant and informative, followed by the context providing the date of death for George William Whitaker. The other contexts do not mention the dates of death for individuals with the same name, so they are less relevant.

Question:Who is the spouse of the director of film Eden And After?
golden idx: [3, 4]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider how well each context matches the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps and how relevant they are to the claim. 1. Context 4: This context directly mentions Alain Robbe-Grillet and states that he was married to Catherine Robbe-Grillet, which directly answers the claim. 2. Context 3: This context is about the film "Eden and After," which is directed by Alain Robbe-Grillet, making it highly relevant. 3. Context 6: This context mentions Catherine Jourdan, who starred in "Eden and After," and while it doesn't answer the claim, it is closely related to the film. 4. Context 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9: These contexts mention various individuals and their spouses but are not related to Alain Robbe-Grillet or the film "Eden and After." They are ranked lower as they are less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

step-by-step think:1. Context 4 ("Alain Robbe-Grillet"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Alain Robbe-Grillet and provides information about his marriage to Catherine Robbe-Grillet, which directly answers the claim. 2. Context 3 ("Eden and After"): This context is relevant because it mentions the film directed by Alain Robbe-Grillet, which is related to the claim, but it does not mention his spouse. 3. Context 6 ("Catherine Jourdan"): This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions an actress who starred in "Eden and After," which could lead to confusion with Catherine Robbe-Grillet, but it does not provide information about the director's spouse. 4. Context 7 ("Heather D. Gibson"): This context is the least relevant among the top four because it mentions a spouse, but not of Alain Robbe-Grillet. The other contexts (0, 1, 2, 5) are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Alain Robbe-Grillet or the film "Eden and After."
idx: [4, 3, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with index 4 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Alain Robbe-Grillet and provides information about his spouse, Catherine Robbe-Grillet, which directly answers the claim. 2. Context with index 3 is the second most relevant because it mentions the film "Eden and After" and its director, Alain Robbe-Grillet, which is related to the claim but does not mention his spouse. 3. Context with index 6 mentions Catherine Jourdan, who starred in "Eden and After," which provides a connection to the film but is not directly related to the claim about Alain Robbe-Grillet's spouse.

Question:Where was the place of death of Anastasia Of Serbia's husband?
golden idx: [1, 3]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 

1. Context 1 ("Stefan Nemanja"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Stefan Nemanja and provides detailed information about his life, including his place of death, which is Hilandar on Mount Athos. It matches both reasoning steps and is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 3 ("Anastasia of Serbia"): This context is relevant because it mentions Anastasia of Serbia and her relationship with Stefan Nemanja, addressing the first reasoning step. However, it does not mention the place of death, making it less likely to contain the answer than context 1.
3. Context 7 ("Princess Helen of Serbia"): This context is indirectly relevant as it mentions the Serbian royal family and could potentially contain information related to the claim, but it does not directly address the reasoning steps.
4. Context 0 ("Slavica Đukić Dejanović"): This context is not relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps and is unlikely to contain the answer.
5. Context 2 ("Dimitrije Nešić"): This context is not relevant as it does not mention the entities related to the claim or the reasoning steps.
6. Context 4 ("Suzana Grubješić"): This context is not relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps.
7. Context 5 ("Marjana Maraš"): This context is not relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps.

9. Context 8 ("Jovan Veselinov"): This context is not relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps.
10. Context 9 ("Dragan Tomić"): This context is not relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps.

Based on the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer, the top 8 ranked contexts are:
idx: [1, 3, 7, 0, 2, 4, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the place of death of Anastasia of Serbia's husband, Stefan Nemanja. The reasoning steps provided are 'Anastasia of Serbia spouse Stefan Nemanja' and 'Stefan Nemanja place of death Hilandar'. 
1. Context 1 titled 'Stefan Nemanja' is the most relevant as it directly mentions Stefan Nemanja and provides detailed information about his life, including his abdication and becoming a monk at Mount Athos, where he restored the Hilandar Monastery. This context is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 3 titled 'Anastasia of Serbia' is relevant as it mentions Anastasia and her monastic vows, but it does not directly address the place of death of her husband, making it less likely to contain the answer than context 1.
3. Context 7 titled 'Princess Helen of Serbia' is less relevant as it does not mention Stefan Nemanja or his place of death, but it does provide context about the Serbian royal family, which could be tangentially related.
4. Context 2 titled 'Dimitrije Nešić' is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Stefan Nemanja or Anastasia of Serbia, nor does it provide information about the place of death.
The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the entities or relationships specified in the reasoning steps.
idx: [1, 3, 7, 2]

step-by-step think:1. Context 1 titled "Stefan Nemanja" is the most relevant as it directly mentions Stefan Nemanja and provides detailed information about his life, including his place of death, which is Hilandar on Mount Athos. This context matches perfectly with the reasoning steps and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context 3 titled "Anastasia of Serbia" is relevant as it mentions Anastasia and her relationship with Stefan Nemanja, but it does not provide information about his place of death. However, it is still informative and somewhat relevant to the claim. 3. Context 7 titled "Princess Helen of Serbia" is less relevant as it does not mention Stefan Nemanja or his place of death, but it is related to the Serbian royal family and could potentially contain useful background information. Context 2 titled "Dimitrije Nešić" is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention any of the entities related to the claim.

Question:Are Fire In Hell and The Tiger: An Old Hunter'S Tale from the same country?
golden idx: [0, 3]
step-by-step think: The claim is to determine if "Fire In Hell" and "The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale" are from the same country. The reasoning steps provided are 'Fire in Hell country of origin South Korea' and "The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale country of origin South Korea". Therefore, the contexts that mention South Korea as the country of origin for both movies should be ranked highest.

1. Context idx 3 ("Fire in Hell"): This context directly mentions "Fire in Hell" and states it is a South Korean film, which matches one of the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 0 ("The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale"): This context directly mentions "The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale" and confirms it is a South Korean film, matching the other reasoning step.
3. Context idx 1 ("Return of the Tiger"): This context might be considered relevant due to the title similarity with "The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale", but it does not mention the country of origin, making it less relevant than the top two contexts.
4. Context idx 9 ("India: Kingdom of the Tiger"): The title contains "Tiger", which might seem relevant, but the context is about a documentary in India, not a South Korean film.
5. Context idx 4 ("Hell and Back"): The title contains "Hell", which might seem relevant, but the context does not provide any information about the country of origin.
6. Context idx 7 ("2008 in comics"): The mention of "Reign in Hell" could be misleadingly relevant, but it does not provide information about the country of origin.
7. Context idx 8 ("Burn in Hell"): Similar to idx 7, the title contains "Hell" but lacks information on the country of origin.
8. Context idx 5 ("News in Hell"): This context is about an Argentine film, which is not relevant to the claim.

The remaining contexts (idx 2, 6) are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention either of the movies or South Korea.

idx: [3, 0, 1, 9, 4, 7, 8, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 3 "Fire in Hell": This context is highly relevant as it confirms the film "Fire in Hell" is a South Korean drama, matching one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 0 "The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale": This context is equally relevant, confirming that "The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale" is also a South Korean film, matching the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 1 "Return of the Tiger": This context is less relevant because it does not mention South Korea, but it could be confused with "The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale" due to a similar title. 4. Context idx 9 "India: Kingdom of the Tiger": This context is informative but less relevant as it pertains to India, not South Korea.
idx: [3, 0, 1, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. "Fire in Hell" context: This context directly matches the first reasoning step, mentioning "Fire in Hell" as a South Korean film, which is highly relevant to the claim. 2. "The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale" context: This context also directly matches the second reasoning step, confirming "The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale" as a South Korean film, making it equally relevant to the claim. 3. "Return of the Tiger" context: Although this context mentions a title with "Tiger" in it, it does not match the reasoning steps related to the country of origin and is about a different film, making it less relevant. 4. "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" context: This context is about a documentary related to tigers in India, which does not match the reasoning steps about South Korean films, making it the least relevant to the claim.

Question:Which film was released more recently, Lo Zappatore or Placer Sangriento?
golden idx: [4, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine which film was released more recently, we need to compare the publication dates of 'Lo Zappatore' and 'Placer Sangriento'. The reasoning steps provided are 'Lo Zappatore publication date 1950' and 'Placer sangriento publication date 1967'. Therefore, we will rank the contexts based on how well they match these entities and dates, their relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 4 ('Placer sangriento'): This context is directly relevant as it confirms the publication date of 'Placer Sangriento' to be 1967, which is one of the films in question.
2. Context idx 8 ('Lo Zappatore'): This context is also directly relevant as it confirms the publication date of 'Lo Zappatore' to be 1950, which is the other film in question.
3. Context idx 1 ('Rakka (film)'): This context mentions a release date of 2017, which is more recent than both films in question but is not directly related to the claim.
4. Context idx 5 ('Ronaldo (film)'): This context mentions a release date of 2015, which is also more recent than both films in question but is not directly related to the claim.
5. Context idx 3 ('Lloyd (film)'): This context mentions a release date of 2001, which is more recent than both films in question but is not directly related to the claim.
6. Context idx 2 ('Coney Island Baby (film)'): This context mentions a release date of 2003, which is more recent than both films in question but is not directly related to the claim.
7. Context idx 0 ('The Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio'): This context mentions a release date of 2009, which is more recent than both films in question but is not directly related to the claim.
8. Context idx 6 ('Invasion of the Neptune Men'): This context mentions a release date of 1961, which is not as recent as 'Placer Sangriento' but is more recent than 'Lo Zappatore'.

The remaining contexts are not as relevant because they either do not mention a specific release date or the release date mentioned is earlier than both films in question.

idx: [4, 8, 1, 5, 3, 2, 0, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Placer sangriento" context: This context directly matches one of the reasoning steps, stating the film's release year as 1967, which is relevant to the claim. 2. "Lo Zappatore" context: This context also directly matches one of the reasoning steps, stating the film's release year as 1950, which is relevant to the claim. 3. "Rakka (film)" context: While this context does not relate to the films in question, it mentions a release date of 2017, which is more recent than both films in the claim but is not directly relevant. 4. "Ronaldo (film)" context: This context mentions a release date of 2015, which is also more recent than the films in the claim but again, not directly relevant. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps and are less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [4, 8, 1, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "Placer sangriento" context: This context directly matches one of the reasoning steps, stating the publication date of 1967, which is relevant to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Lo Zappatore" context: This context also directly matches one of the reasoning steps, stating the publication date of 1950, which is relevant to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Rakka (film)" context: Although this context is about a film, it does not relate to the claim about the release dates of "Lo Zappatore" or "Placer Sangriento." However, it mentions a release date, which is relevant to the concept of film release dates. 4. "Ronaldo (film)" context: This context provides information about the release of a film, but it is not directly relevant to the claim about the two films in question.

Question:Was Şemsettin Baş or Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec born first?
golden idx: [2, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine which context ranks highest, I will consider the relevance to the claim and the presence of specific information about the birth dates of Şemsettin Baş and Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec. Context 2 directly mentions Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec and his date of birth, making it highly relevant. Context 6 mentions Şemsettin Baş and his date of birth, so it is equally relevant. The other contexts do not mention the birth dates but may contain related information. Context 0 discusses a historical figure named Gwenc'Hlan, which could be confused with Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec, so it ranks next for relevance. Context 3 mentions Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec as a predecessor, so it's somewhat relevant. Context 5 mentions Maurice Le Scouëzec, possibly related to Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec, so it follows. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim but are ranked based on the potential connection to the individuals in question or their cultural background.
idx: [2, 6, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim is about determining who was born first between Şemsettin Baş and Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec. The reasoning steps provided are the dates of birth for both individuals. 1. Context idx 2: This context directly mentions Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec and his date of birth, which is crucial for answering the claim. 2. Context idx 6: This context directly mentions Şemsettin Baş and his date of birth, which is also crucial for answering the claim. 3. Context idx 0: This context talks about a legendary figure named Gwenc'Hlan, which might be confused with Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec, but it does not provide the date of birth, making it less relevant. 4. Context idx 3: This context mentions Per Vari Kerloc'h, who succeeded Gwenc'Hlan Le Scouëzec as Grand Druid, providing some relevance to the claim but not directly answering it. The other contexts are about different individuals and are not relevant to the claim.
idx: [2, 6, 0, 3]

step-by-step think:1. "Gwenc'hlan Le Scouëzec" context: This context directly mentions Gwenc'hlan Le Scouëzec and provides his exact date of birth, which is crucial for addressing the claim. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Şemsettin Baş" context: This context directly mentions Şemsettin Baş and provides his date of birth. It is equally relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Per Vari Kerloc'h" context: This context mentions Gwenc'hlan Le Scouëzec as the predecessor of Per Vari Kerloc'h, providing indirect information related to Gwenc'hlan Le Scouëzec's time period. It is less directly relevant than the first two contexts but still contains useful information that could help address the claim.

Question:Who is Cornelia (Wife Of Caesar)'s child-in-law?
golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about Cornelia's child-in-law, we need to identify contexts that mention Cornelia, her child Julia, and Julia's spouse Pompey. Context 1: "Julia (daughter of Caesar)" is the most relevant as it mentions Julia as the daughter of Caesar and Cornelia, and her marriage to Pompey. Context 6: "Cornelia (wife of Caesar)" is also highly relevant, providing information about Cornelia and her daughter Julia. Context 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the entities or relationships specified in the reasoning steps.
idx: [1, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Julia (daughter of Caesar)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Julia, the daughter of Cornelia and Caesar, and her spouse Pompey, which directly relates to the claim and the reasoning steps. 2. "Cornelia (wife of Caesar)" context: This context is also highly relevant as it mentions Cornelia, the wife of Caesar, and her daughter Julia, which is essential for identifying the child-in-law. 3. "Greg Penner" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different person and family. 4. "Conny Stuart" context: This context is not relevant as it refers to a different Cornelia and does not mention the entities related to the claim. 5. "Peter James (writer)" context: This context is not relevant as it refers to a different Cornelia and does not mention the entities related to the claim. 6. "Eusebius (consul 359)" context: This context is not relevant as it does not mention any entities related to the claim. 7. "Charles Francis Norton" context: This context is not relevant as it does not mention any entities related to the claim. 8. "Wyndham Goold" context: This context is not relevant as it does not mention any entities related to the claim. 9. "Robert Vadra" context: This context is not relevant as it does not mention any entities related to the claim. 10. "Robert W. Levering" context: This context is not relevant as it does not mention any entities related to the claim.
idx: [1, 6, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim involves identifying the child-in-law of Cornelia, wife of Caesar. The reasoning steps guide us to look for contexts mentioning Cornelia's child, Julia, and Julia's spouse, Pompey. 1. Context 1 titled 'Julia (daughter of Caesar)' directly mentions Julia as the daughter of Caesar and Cornelia, and her marriage to Pompey, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context 6 titled 'Cornelia (wife of Caesar)' also mentions Julia as the daughter of Cornelia and her influential connections, which makes it relevant but slightly less direct in answering the claim compared to context 1. 3. Context 0 titled 'Greg Penner' and context 2 titled 'Conny Stuart' are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the entities or relationships specified in the reasoning steps.

Question:Why did John Middleton Murry's wife die?
golden idx: [1, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 1. Context idx 9: This context is directly related to Katherine Mansfield and mentions her cause of death as tuberculosis, which is exactly what the claim is asking for. 2. Context idx 1: This context talks about John Middleton Murry and his association with Katherine Mansfield, which is relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 3: This context mentions a close relationship with Katherine Mansfield, which makes it somewhat relevant. 4. Context idx 4: This context mentions John Middleton Murry and could provide background information that might be relevant to the claim. 5. Context idx 5: This context also mentions John Middleton Murry, but it seems less directly related to the claim than the previous contexts. 6. Context idx 0: This context is about John Middleton Murry Jr., which is not directly relevant to the claim. 7. Context idx 2: This context is about a different John Middleton and is not relevant to the claim. 8. Context idx 7: This context is about yet another John Middleton and does not seem relevant to the claim.
idx: [9, 1, 3, 4, 5, 0, 2, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 9 titled 'Katherine Mansfield' directly addresses the claim by mentioning Katherine Mansfield and providing information about her diagnosis with tuberculosis, which is the cause of death according to the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 1 titled 'John Middleton Murry' is relevant as it mentions his association with Katherine Mansfield, whom he married, and talks about his life after her death, which is indirectly related to the claim. 3. Context idx 3 titled 'Anne Estelle Rice' is less directly related to the claim but mentions a close relationship with Katherine Mansfield, which could provide additional context to her life and death. 4. Context idx 4 titled 'Philip Mairet' mentions John Middleton Murry and his work, which is less directly related to the claim but still provides relevant background information. The remaining contexts are not directly related to Katherine Mansfield or her cause of death and therefore score lower in relevance to the claim.
idx: [9, 1, 3, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Katherine Mansfield" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Katherine Mansfield and provides specific information about her diagnosis with tuberculosis, which is the cause of death mentioned in the reasoning steps. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "John Middleton Murry" context: This context is relevant because it mentions John Middleton Murry's association with Katherine Mansfield, including their marriage and his work following her death. However, it does not directly address her cause of death. 3. "Anne Estelle Rice" context: This context is less relevant than the first two. It mentions a close relationship with Katherine Mansfield but does not provide information about her death. 4. "Philip Mairet" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention Katherine Mansfield's death or provide any information that would likely contain the answer to the claim.

Based on the rules for ranking, the contexts that match the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps and are more likely to contain the answer to the claim are ranked higher.
idx: [4, 8, 5, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it mentions 'Adud al-Dawla and his father Rukn al-Dawla, directly linking to the reasoning steps. It provides extensive information about 'Adud al-Dawla's life and lineage, which is crucial for answering the claim about Taj al-Dawla's paternal grandfather. 2. Context idx 8: This context is also relevant because it identifies 'Adud al-Dawla as the father of Taj al-Dawla. However, it does not mention Rukn al-Dawla, making it slightly less informative than context idx 4 for the claim. 3. Context idx 5: Although this context talks about Rukn al-Dawla and his relationship with 'Adud al-Dawla, it is more focused on Ali ibn Kama and does not provide direct information about Taj al-Dawla's paternal grandfather. It is relevant but less so than the first two contexts.

golden idx: [3, 4]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the place of birth of Gu Changwei, the director of the film "And the Spring Comes." The reasoning steps provided are 'And the Spring Comes director Gu Changwei' and "Gu Changwei place of birth Xi'an." Therefore, the contexts that mention Gu Changwei and his place of birth will be ranked highest. 

1. Context idx 3: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions Gu Changwei and states that he was born in Xi'an, which answers the claim.
2. Context idx 4: This context is relevant because it mentions the film "And the Spring Comes" and its director Gu Changwei, but it does not mention his place of birth.
3. Context idx 2: This context is about Brian Johnson, a director of film and television special effects, which is somewhat related to the film industry but does not provide information about Gu Changwei or his place of birth.
4. Context idx 6: This context is about Ian Barry, an Australian director of film and TV, which is related to the film industry but does not provide information about Gu Changwei or his place of birth.
5. Context idx 7: This context is about Hanro Smitsman, a writer and director of film and television, which is related to the film industry but does not provide information about Gu Changwei or his place of birth.
6. Context idx 0: This context is about Rachel Feldman, an American director of film and television, which is related to the film industry but does not provide information about Gu Changwei or his place of birth.

8. Context idx 1: This context is about Peter Holden, an American actor and producer of film and television, which is related to the film industry but does not provide information about Gu Changwei or his place of birth.

The remaining contexts (idx 8 and idx 9) are less relevant as they do not pertain to the film industry or Gu Changwei and therefore are not included in the top 8.

idx: [3, 4, 2, 6, 7, 0, 5, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 3: This context directly mentions "Gu Changwei" and provides information about his place of birth, Xi'an, which is exactly what the claim is asking for. It is highly relevant and informative. 2. Context idx 4: This context mentions "And the Spring Comes" and "Gu Changwei" as the director, which is related to the claim. However, it does not mention his place of birth, making it slightly less relevant than context idx 3. 3. Context idx 0: This context is about "Rachel Feldman," an American director, which is not directly related to the claim but shares the profession of being a director. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to contexts that mention Gu Changwei. 4. Context idx 5: This context talks about "Dana Blankstein-Cohen," a director of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television. Similar to context idx 0, it is not directly related to the claim but is about a film director, which is a shared profession with Gu Changwei.
idx: [3, 4, 0, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with idx 3 titled 'Gu Changwei' directly matches the reasoning steps as it mentions both 'Gu Changwei' and his place of birth 'Xi'an', making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

Question:Who died first, Madame Pasca or James A. Donohoe?
golden idx: [5, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine who died first, we need to compare the dates of death for Madame Pasca and James A. Donohoe. 1. Context idx 5 directly mentions Madame Pasca and her date of death, which is crucial for answering the claim. 2. Context idx 6 directly mentions James A. Donohoe and his date of death, which is equally crucial. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative for the claim. 3. The other contexts mention different individuals named James or related to the name but do not provide information about the death dates of the individuals in question, making them less relevant. However, they are ranked based on the presence of the name 'James' as it is part of the claim. 4. Context idx 3 mentions a 'James' who died on February 26, which coincidentally matches the death date of James A. Donohoe, but since it refers to a different person (J. L. Carr), it is less relevant. 5. The remaining contexts are ranked lower as they are less relevant to the claim.
idx: [5, 6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: To determine who died first, Madame Pasca or James A. Donohoe, we need to compare their dates of death. The reasoning steps provided are 'Madame Pasca date of death May 25, 1914', and 'James A. Donohoe date of death February 26, 1956'. Therefore, we need to find contexts that confirm these dates.
1. Context idx 5: This context is about Madame Pasca and confirms her date of death as May 25, 1914. It matches perfectly with the reasoning step for Madame Pasca and is highly relevant to the claim.
2. Context idx 6: This context is about James A. Donohoe and confirms his date of death as February 26, 1956. It matches perfectly with the reasoning step for James A. Donohoe and is highly relevant to the claim.
3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a James (James Corker) and a date of death (March 24, 1791), but it does not match the reasoning steps as it is about a different James. However, it is somewhat relevant as it provides a date of death for a person named James.
4. Context idx 7: This context mentions a Jacques or James Abbadie with a date of death (25 September 1727), which is not relevant to the claim but is included because it mentions a date of death for a person named James.
The other contexts do not mention dates of death and are not relevant to the claim.
idx: [5, 6, 4, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context with index 5 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Madame Pasca and provides the exact date of her death, which matches one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context with index 6 is the second most relevant because it directly mentions James A. Donohoe and provides the exact date of his death, matching the other reasoning step. 3. Contexts with index 4 and 7 are not relevant to the claim as they mention different individuals who are not related to the claim. Between them, index 4 is slightly more relevant as it mentions a death date, but it's still not about the individuals in question.

Question:Who was born later, D'Arcy Coulson or Thomas William Adams?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born later between D'Arcy Coulson and Thomas William Adams, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are "D'Arcy Coulson date of birth February 17, 1908", and 'Thomas William Adams date of birth 24 June 1842'. Therefore, we need to find contexts that confirm these dates of birth.

1. Context idx 9 ("D'Arcy Coulson") directly mentions D'Arcy Coulson's date of birth as February 17, 1908, which matches one of the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 0 ("Thomas William Adams") directly mentions Thomas William Adams' date of birth as 24 June 1842, which matches the other reasoning step.
3. The other contexts mention different individuals with similar names but do not provide information relevant to the claim about the birth dates of D'Arcy Coulson or Thomas William Adams.

Based on the rules for ranking, contexts that match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps and are more likely to contain the answer to the claim should be ranked higher. Therefore, the top two contexts are idx 9 and idx 0, as they directly confirm the dates of birth for both individuals in question.

The remaining contexts do not provide relevant information to the claim, but they will be ranked based on the closeness of the title to the entities in the claim, even though they are less likely to contain the answer.

idx: [9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim requires identifying who was born later between D'Arcy Coulson and Thomas William Adams. The reasoning steps provide the dates of birth for both individuals. 1. Context idx 9 ("D'Arcy Coulson"): This context is highly relevant as it matches the entity "D'Arcy Coulson" and provides the exact date of birth, which is crucial for answering the claim. 2. Context idx 0 ("Thomas William Adams"): This context is equally relevant because it matches the entity "Thomas William Adams" and provides the exact date of birth. 3. Context idx 1 ("Thomas William Booker-Blakemore"): This context is less relevant because, despite sharing a similar name, it refers to a different individual and does not provide information that would help answer the claim. 4. Context idx 2 ("Tom Goddard"): This context is also less relevant because it refers to another individual with a similar name and does not contribute to answering the claim about the birth dates of D'Arcy Coulson or Thomas William Adams.
idx: [9, 0, 1, 2]

step-by-step think:1. Context with index 9 ("D'Arcy Coulson"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions D'Arcy Coulson and provides his exact date of birth, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is informative and contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context with index 0 ('Thomas William Adams'): This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions Thomas William Adams and provides his exact date of birth, which matches the other reasoning step. It is equally informative and contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context with index 1 ('Thomas William Booker-Blakemore'): Although this context mentions a different Thomas William, it is less relevant than the first two contexts but more so than the last one because it shares a similar name. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. Context with index 2 ('Tom Goddard'): This context is the least relevant as it does not match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps and is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:Are Simonds Catholic College and Saginaw High School (Texas) both located in the same country?
golden idx: [4, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to find contexts that mention the countries of Simonds Catholic College and Saginaw High School (Texas). Context 4 mentions Simonds Catholic College and its location in Melbourne, Australia, which directly matches one of the reasoning steps. Context 9 mentions Saginaw High School and its location in Texas, USA, which matches the other reasoning step. These two contexts are the most relevant and likely contain the answer to the claim. Context 1 mentions Saginaw High School, but it is located in Michigan, USA, which could cause confusion, so it ranks lower. Contexts 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 do not mention either of the schools or their countries, making them less relevant.
idx: [4,9,1,0,2,3,5,6]

step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to identify the country in which each school is located. 1. "Simonds Catholic College" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the school is located in Melbourne, which is in Australia. It directly addresses half of the claim regarding Simonds Catholic College. 2. "Saginaw High School (Texas)" context: This context is equally relevant as it specifies that the school is located in Texas, United States. It addresses the other half of the claim regarding Saginaw High School. 3. "Saginaw High School" context: While this context is about a different Saginaw High School located in Michigan, USA, it is less relevant because it does not pertain to the Saginaw High School in Texas. However, it still mentions a location in the United States, which is useful for comparison. 4. "St. Joseph High School (Victoria, Texas)" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a location in Texas, USA, and could be informative for understanding the geographical context of high schools in Texas. The other contexts are less relevant because they do not mention either of the schools in question or their locations.
idx: [4, 9, 1, 2]

step-by-step think: 1. "Simonds Catholic College" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Simonds Catholic College and provides detailed information about its location in Melbourne, Australia. It matches the first reasoning step perfectly and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Saginaw High School (Texas)" context: This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions Saginaw High School and its location in Texas, United States. It matches the second reasoning step perfectly and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Saginaw High School" context: Although this context is about a different Saginaw High School located in Michigan, USA, it is still relevant to the claim as it pertains to a school in the United States and could be confused with the one in Texas. It is less relevant than the first two contexts but still likely to contain useful information for the claim.

Question:Which country Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm Of Nassau's mother is from?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 

1. Context idx 5: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Princess Pauline of Württemberg and provides information about her being from the Kingdom of Württemberg, which is in Germany. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 3: This context mentions Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau and his mother Princess Pauline of Württemberg, which is relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention her country of citizenship, so it is slightly less relevant than idx 5.
3. Context idx 0: This context is related to the family of Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau but does not mention Princess Pauline of Württemberg or her country of citizenship. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
4. Context idx 1: This context talks about the Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, which is related to the Nassau family but does not mention Princess Pauline of Württemberg. It is less relevant than idx 0.
5. Context idx 2: Similar to idx 1, this context discusses the Duke of Nassau, which is related to the Nassau family but does not mention Princess Pauline of Württemberg. It is less relevant than idx 0.
6. Context idx 4: This context mentions Adolf of Nassau, a different member of the Nassau family, and does not provide information about Princess Pauline of Württemberg. It is less relevant than idx 1 and 2.
7. Context idx 6: This context discusses Walram II of Nassau, another member of the Nassau family, without mentioning Princess Pauline of Württemberg. It is less relevant than idx 4.
8. Context idx 7: This context is about Henry I of Nassau-Siegen, which is less relevant to the claim as it does not mention Princess Pauline of Württemberg or her country of citizenship.

The remaining contexts (idx 8 and 9) are not directly related to the claim and are therefore ranked lower.

idx: [5, 3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To address the claim about Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau's mother's country of origin, I will rank the contexts based on the reasoning steps provided. 1. Context 5: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Princess Pauline of Württemberg by name and provides information about her being a member of the House of Württemberg and a Princess of Württemberg by birth, which directly relates to the reasoning step regarding her German citizenship. 2. Context 3: This context is also relevant because it mentions Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau and identifies Princess Pauline of Württemberg as his mother, which is essential for establishing her relationship to him. 3. Context 0: This context is less directly related to the claim but still relevant as it mentions Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau and provides information about his family, which could indirectly lead to information about his mother. 4. Context 1: This context mentions the House of Nassau and provides historical context about its rulers, which might be informative but is less directly related to the claim compared to the other contexts.
idx: [5, 3, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the country of origin of Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau's mother, who is Princess Pauline of Württemberg. The reasoning steps provided indicate that Princess Pauline's country of citizenship is German. Therefore, the contexts should be ranked based on how well they match the entities 'Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau', 'Princess Pauline of Württemberg', and the relationship that indicates her nationality or country of origin.
1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Princess Pauline of Württemberg by name and provides detailed information about her, including her full German name and her connection to the House of Württemberg, which is in Germany. It also mentions her marriage and descendants, which adds to its relevance.
2. Context idx 3: This context is also relevant because it mentions Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau and identifies Princess Pauline of Württemberg as his mother, directly linking to the claim.
3. Context idx 0: This context is less relevant because it focuses on Countess Sophie of Merenberg, who is a descendant of Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau, but it does not mention Princess Pauline's country of origin.
4. Context idx 1: This context is the least relevant as it discusses Frederick William, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, who is not directly related to the claim about Princess Pauline's country of origin.
Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the top three contexts are 5, 3, and 0.

step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandfather of Alexandre Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram, we need to identify the father of Napoléon Alexandre Berthier first, as per the reasoning steps. Context 9 directly mentions Louis Philippe Marie "Alexandre" Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram, and his father Napoléon Alexandre Berthier, which is highly relevant to the claim. Context 3 mentions Napoléon Alexandre Berthier, 2nd Prince of Wagram, and his father Louis-Alexandre Berthier, which is crucial for identifying the paternal grandfather. Context 5 mentions Louis-Alexandre Berthier, 1st Prince of Wagram, who is the paternal grandfather in question. Context 2 mentions Duchess Maria Elisabeth in Bavaria, who became Princess of Wagram through marriage to Louis-Alexandre Berthier, adding relevance to the claim. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the entities directly related to the claim. Therefore, they are ranked lower.
idx: [9, 3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 4, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandfather of Alexandre Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram, we need to identify his father and then his paternal grandfather. The reasoning steps provided are: 1. 'Alexandre Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram father Napoléon Alexandre Berthier', 2. 'Napoléon Alexandre Berthier father Louis-Alexandre Berthier'. Therefore, we are looking for contexts that mention these relationships. 
1. Context idx 9 mentions Alexandre Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram, and states that he is the son of Napoléon Alexandre Berthier and the grandson of Louis Alexandre Berthier, directly answering the claim.
2. Context idx 3 mentions Napoléon Alexandre Berthier, 2nd Prince of Wagram, and identifies his father as Louis-Alexandre Berthier, which is relevant to the second step of the reasoning.

Context idx 5: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions Louis-Alexandre Berthier, who is the paternal grandfather of Alexandre Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram according to the reasoning steps. It provides detailed information about him, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 3: This context is also relevant because it mentions Napoléon Alexandre Berthier, the father of Alexandre Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram, and Louis-Alexandre Berthier, linking the two generations together. It is informative and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 9: This context mentions Alexandre Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram, and his parents, which makes it relevant. However, it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that mention his grandfather directly.

The reasoning steps highlight that Gian Galeazzo Visconti was born in Pavia. Therefore, I'll look for contexts that mention Gian Galeazzo Visconti and Pavia.
1. Context 5 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Gian Galeazzo Visconti and provides detailed information about his life, including his role as the Duke of Milan.
2. Context 7 is the second most relevant because it mentions Caterina Visconti and her relationship with Gian Galeazzo Visconti, which is directly related to the claim.
3. Context 0 mentions a person with the last name Visconti and is related to Pavia, but it's about Pietro Visconti, not Gian Galeazzo, so it's less relevant.
4. Context 1 mentions Alberto Visconti, which is the same surname as the subject of the claim, but there's no direct connection to Gian Galeazzo or Pavia.
5. Context 4 mentions Mario Visconti, again sharing the surname but not directly related to the claim.
6. Context 9 mentions Giovanni Visconti, sharing the surname but not relevant to the claim.
7. Context 8 mentions Giacomo Feo, who was a husband of Caterina Sforza, not Caterina Visconti, so it's less relevant.
8. Contexts 2, 3, and 6 are not relevant as they do not mention the Visconti family or Pavia.
idx: [5,7,0,1,4,9,8,2]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Gian Galeazzo Visconti and provides information about his life and rule in Milan. It also mentions Pavia in relation to the Visconti Castle, aligning with the reasoning step regarding his place of birth. 2. Context idx 7: This context is about Caterina Visconti, Gian Galeazzo's spouse, and provides background on their relationship and her role after his death. It is relevant due to the direct connection to Gian Galeazzo. 3. Context idx 8: This context is less relevant as it discusses Giacomo Feo, who is not directly related to the claim but is associated with Caterina Sforza, a different historical figure. 4. Context idx 9: This context is about Giovanni Visconti, a cyclist, who shares the last name but is not related to the historical figures in question. It is the least relevant among the top four.
idx: [5, 7, 8, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the birthplace of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, the husband of Caterina Visconti. The reasoning steps provided are 'Caterina Visconti spouse Gian Galeazzo Visconti' and 'Gian Galeazzo Visconti place of birth Pavia'. 1.

Question:Who was born first, John Beach or Gordon Persons?
golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between John Beach and Gordon Persons, I will rank the contexts based on the dates of birth provided in the reasoning steps. 1. "John Beach" context: This context directly mentions John Beach and provides his date of birth as January 1, 1812, which is relevant to the claim. 2. "Gordon Persons" context: This context directly mentions Gordon Persons and provides his date of birth as February 5, 1902, which is relevant to the claim. 3. "Nelson J. Beach" context: Although this context mentions a different Beach (Nelson J. Beach), it provides a date of birth that is earlier than Gordon Persons but not relevant to John Beach. 4. "John Litel" context: This context mentions a John Beach Litel with different dates, which could cause confusion but is still somewhat relevant. 5. "John McMahon (Surrey and Somerset cricketer)" context: This context is not directly relevant as it mentions a different John and does not provide a date of birth. 6. "Henry Moore (cricketer)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either John Beach or Gordon Persons. 7. "Wesley Barresi" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either John Beach or Gordon Persons. 8. "Wale Adebanwi" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either John Beach or Gordon Persons.
idx: [1, 6, 9, 3, 8, 2, 0, 4]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between John Beach and Gordon Persons, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are 'John Beach date of birth January 1, 1812' and 'Gordon Persons date of birth February 5, 1902'. Based on these dates, John Beach was born first. Now, let's rank the contexts based on how well they match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, their relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 1 titled 'John Beach' directly matches the first reasoning step, providing the exact date of birth for John Beach and additional biographical information, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 6 titled 'Gordon Persons' directly matches the second reasoning step, providing the exact date of birth for Gordon Persons and additional biographical information, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 9 titled 'Nelson J. Beach' mentions a different John Beach with a different birth date, which could potentially confuse the answer to the claim, but it is still somewhat relevant due to the name match.
4. Context idx 3 titled 'John Litel' mentions a John Beach Litel with a birth date that does not match either of the reasoning steps, but it is included because it contains the name 'John Beach' within the text.

The other contexts do not mention the names John Beach or Gordon Persons and are therefore not relevant to the claim.
idx: [1, 6, 9, 3]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between John Beach and Gordon Persons, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are 'John Beach date of birth January 1, 1812' and 'Gordon Persons date of birth February 5, 1902'. Based on these dates, John Beach was born first. Now, let's rank the contexts:
1. Context idx 1 ("John Beach"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions John Beach and his date of birth, which is crucial for answering the claim.
2. Context idx 6 ("Gordon Persons"): This context is also highly relevant because it provides the date of birth for Gordon Persons, which is necessary to compare with John Beach's date of birth.
3. Context idx 9 ("Nelson J. Beach"): This context is less relevant because it mentions a different person, Nelson J. Beach, who is not part of the claim.
4. Context idx 3 ("John Litel"): This context is the least relevant as it mentions John Litel, who is not related to the claim at all.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the top 3 ranked contexts are:

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim and the reasoning steps. 1. "La Leona (film)" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it mentions the film "La Leona" and its director Armando Bo. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Armando Bó" context: This context provides detailed information about Armando Bó, including his family, which is crucial for answering the claim. It mentions his son Víctor Bó, which is directly related to the reasoning steps. 3. "Dana Blankstein" context: While this context mentions a film director, it is not directly related to "La Leona" or Armando Bó. However, it is still more relevant than other contexts that do not mention film directors at all. 4. "Ian Barry (director)" context: This context is about a film director, which makes it somewhat relevant, but it does not mention "La Leona" or Armando Bó. 5. "Peter Levin" context: Similar to the previous context, it mentions a director but lacks direct relevance to the claim. 6. "John Farrell (businessman)" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a director of YouTube, which is unrelated to the film industry. 7. "Laurent Le Bon" context: This context is about the director of a museum, which is not relevant to the film industry or the claim. 8. "Michael Govan" context: This context is also about a museum director and is not relevant to the claim about the film industry.
idx: [3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Armando Bó and directly states that his son is the actor Víctor Bó, which answers the claim. 2. Context idx 3: This context is about the film "La Leona" and mentions Armando Bó as the director, which is relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention his child, making it less informative than context idx 4. 3. Context idx 2: This context is about Dana Blankstein, a film director, but does not relate to the claim about Armando Bó or the film "La Leona." 4. Context idx 5: This context is about Ian Barry, an Australian director, and is not relevant to the claim. The remaining contexts (idx 6, 7, 8, 9) are not relevant as they do not pertain to Armando Bó or the film "La Leona."
idx: [4, 3, 2, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is about identifying the child of Armando Bo, the director of the film "La Leona." The reasoning steps provided are 'La Leona director Armando Bo' and 'Armando Bó child Víctor Bó'. Based on these steps, the contexts should be ranked as follows:

1. Context idx 4 ("Armando Bó"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Armando Bó and confirms that his son is the actor Víctor Bó. It matches both entities from the reasoning steps and is likely to contain the answer to the claim.

2. Context idx 3 ("La Leona (film)"): This context is relevant because it mentions the film "La Leona" and its director Armando Bo. While it doesn't directly answer the claim, it is related to one of the entities in the reasoning steps.

3. Context idx 2 ("Dana Blankstein"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses Dana Blankstein-Cohen, who has no connection to Armando Bo or the film "La Leona."

4. Context idx 5 ("Ian Barry (director)"): This context is also not relevant to the claim as it is about Ian Barry, an Australian director with no connection to Armando Bo or "La Leona."

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the top three contexts are 4, 3, and 2, with context 4 being the most relevant and likely to contain the answer.

Question:Who lived longer, Giuseppe Cesari or Nicos Poulantzas?
golden idx: [1, 3]
step-by-step think: To determine who lived longer, Giuseppe Cesari or Nicos Poulantzas, we need to calculate their lifespans based on their birth and death dates. 1. "Giuseppe Cesari" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides both the birth and death dates of Giuseppe Cesari, which are essential to answer the claim. 2. "Nicos Poulantzas" context: This context is equally important because it contains the birth and death dates of Nicos Poulantzas, allowing us to calculate his lifespan. 3. "Francesco Ruschi" context: This context mentions Giuseppe Cesari as a teacher of Francesco Ruschi, which is somewhat relevant but less so than the contexts that provide direct information about the lifespans of the individuals in question. 4. "Vincenzo Manenti" context: Similar to the previous context, this one mentions Giuseppe Cesari as a mentor, which is relevant but not directly answering the claim. 5. "Bernardino Parasole" context: This context also mentions Giuseppe Cesari, but again, it does not provide information about his lifespan. 6. "Aristides Baltas" context: This context is relevant to Nicos Poulantzas as it mentions the Nicos Poulantzas Institute, but it does not provide information about Poulantzas's lifespan. 7. "Gaius Julius Aquila" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either individual. 8. "Justin (historian)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either individual. 9. "Fred H. Frank" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either individual. 10.

idx: [3,1,2,8,6,4,0,5]

step-by-step think: To determine who lived longer, Giuseppe Cesari or Nicos Poulantzas, we need to calculate their lifespans based on their birth and death dates. 1. Context idx 3: This context provides the complete lifespan of Giuseppe Cesari, which is essential to answer the claim. 2. Context idx 1: This context provides the complete lifespan of Nicos Poulantzas, which is also essential to answer the claim. 3. Context idx 2: This context mentions Giuseppe Cesari as a teacher, which is less directly relevant but still related to one of the individuals in question. 4. Context idx 4: This context also mentions Giuseppe Cesari, but it is about another individual, Vincenzo Manenti, and his relationship with Cesari, which is less relevant to the claim. The other contexts are not directly related to the claim as they do not mention the lifespans or dates related to Cesari or Poulantzas.
idx: [3, 1, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: To determine who lived longer, we need to compare the lifespan of Giuseppe Cesari and Nicos Poulantzas. 1. "Giuseppe Cesari" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides both the birth and death dates of Giuseppe Cesari, which are essential to calculate his lifespan. 2. "Nicos Poulantzas" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides the birth and death dates of Nicos Poulantzas, allowing for a direct comparison of lifespans. 3. "Francesco Ruschi" context: This context is less relevant to the claim but still useful because it mentions Giuseppe Cesari and could potentially provide additional information about his life. 4. "Aristides Baltas" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on Aristides Baltas and only mentions Nicos Poulantzas in relation to the institute named after him, without providing information on Poulantzas's lifespan.

Context 1 mentions Yechiel Michel ben Eliezer, again not related to the claim. 6. Context 2 discusses Adam Baal Shem and mentions Rabbi Yisrael ben Eliezer, which is not directly related to the claim. 7.

Question:Who is Arthur Gore, 2Nd Earl Of Arran's paternal grandfather?
golden idx: [4, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandfather of Arthur Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran, we need to identify the contexts that mention his father and grandfather. The reasoning steps indicate that Arthur Saunders Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran's father is Arthur Gore, 1st Earl of Arran, and his grandfather is Sir Arthur Gore, 2nd Baronet. Therefore, we should prioritize contexts that mention these individuals and their relationships.

1. Context idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Arthur Gore, 1st Earl of Arran, who is the father of the 2nd Earl of Arran. It provides detailed information about his life and family, which is likely to include the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 1: This context directly mentions Sir Arthur Gore, 2nd Baronet, who is the grandfather of the 2nd Earl of Arran. It provides information about his life and offspring, making it highly relevant.
3. Context idx 8: This context discusses Arthur Saunders Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran, and mentions his father, making it relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 0: This context mentions Paul Annesley Gore, who is related to the Gore family and provides context about the family members, which could be useful for the claim.
5. Context idx 7: This context is less directly related but mentions the Gore family and their connections, which might provide additional context for the claim.
6. Context idx 9: This context is about Philip Gore, 4th Earl of Arran, who is part of the same lineage and could offer background information relevant to the claim.
7. Context idx 5: This context is about a different Earl of Arran and is less likely to contain the answer to the claim but is included due to the title's relevance.
8. Context idx 6: Similar to idx 5, this context is about a different Earl of Arran and is less likely to contain the answer but is included for its relevance.

The remaining contexts (idx 2 and 3) are not related to the Gore family or the Earls of Arran and therefore are not included in the top 8 ranked contexts.

idx: [4, 1, 8, 0, 7, 9, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandfather of Arthur Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran, we need to identify his father and then his paternal grandfather. The reasoning steps provided are: 'Arthur Saunders Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran father Arthur Gore, 1st Earl of Arran', 'Arthur Gore, 1st Earl of Arran father Sir Arthur Gore, 2nd Baronet'. Therefore, we need to find contexts that mention these relationships.
1. Context idx 1: This context mentions Sir Arthur Gore, 2nd Baronet, and states that he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Arthur, who later was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as 1st Earl of Arran. This directly answers the second part of the reasoning steps, making it highly relevant.
2. Context idx 4: This context talks about Arthur Gore, 1st Earl of Arran, and mentions that he was the son of Sir Arthur Gore, 2nd Baronet. This confirms the relationship stated in the reasoning steps and is directly relevant to the claim.
3. Context idx 8: This context discusses Arthur Saunders Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran, and identifies his father as Arthur Gore, 1st Earl of Arran, which is relevant to the first part of the reasoning steps.
4. Context idx 0: This context is about Paul Annesley Gore, who is related to the Gore family but does not directly answer the claim about the paternal grandfather of the 2nd Earl of Arran.
The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the direct lineage or are about different individuals from the Gore family lineage.
idx: [1, 4, 8, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Arthur Gore, 1st Earl of Arran, who is the father of Arthur Saunders Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran, and also mentions Sir Arthur Gore, 2nd Baronet, who is the grandfather. It directly addresses the relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 1: This context is relevant because it discusses Sir Arthur Gore, 2nd Baronet, who is the paternal grandfather of Arthur Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran. It provides detailed information about his life and family, which is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 8: This context is about Arthur Saunders Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran, the subject of the claim. It provides information about his immediate family, which is relevant but does not directly answer the claim about the paternal grandfather. The context idx 0 is less relevant because it talks about Paul Annesley Gore, who is not directly related to the claim.

Question:Which film came out earlier, Aanaval Mothiram or Heroes Of The Street?
golden idx: [4, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine which film came out earlier, 'Aanaval Mothiram' or 'Heroes Of The Street', I will rank the contexts based on the provided reasoning steps which indicate the publication dates of both films. 1. Context idx 4: Directly mentions 'Aanaval Mothiram' and provides the release year as 1991, which is relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: Directly mentions 'Heroes of the Street' and provides the release year as 1922, which is relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 0: Mentions 'The Gambler' as a remake of 'Aanaval Mothiram', indirectly confirming the earlier release of 'Aanaval Mothiram'. 4. Context idx 1: Mentions 'Ragalaipuram' as a remake of 'Aanaval Mothiram', further confirming the film's existence prior to the remake. 5. Context idx 2: 'Heroes of the West' title is similar to 'Heroes Of The Street' but does not provide relevant information. 6. Context idx 5: 'Heroes of the Saddle' is unrelated to 'Heroes Of The Street'. 7. Context idx 6: 'Heroes of the Hills' is also unrelated to 'Heroes Of The Street'. 8. Context idx 8: 'Heroes of the West (1964 film)' is unrelated and does not provide information about the release date of 'Heroes Of The Street'.
idx: [4, 7, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 1. Context idx 4: This context is about "Aanaval Mothiram" and mentions it is a 1991 Malayalam film, which matches one of the reasoning steps regarding its publication date. 2. Context idx 7: This context is about "Heroes of the Street" and confirms its publication date as 1922, directly matching the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 0: This context mentions "Aanaval Mothiram" as the original film that "The Gambler" is a remake of, indicating its relevance to the claim. 4. Context idx 1: This context also mentions "Aanaval Mothiram" as the original film that "Ragalaipuram" is a remake of, showing its relevance. The remaining contexts do not mention either of the films in the claim or their publication dates, making them less relevant.
idx: [4, 7, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Heroes of the Street" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the film "Heroes of the Street" and its publication date of 1922, which is one of the entities in the reasoning steps. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Aanaval Mothiram" context: This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions the film "Aanaval Mothiram" and indicates that it is a 1991 film, which aligns with the reasoning steps that mention its publication date as 1990. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "The Gambler (1995 film)" context: This context is relevant as it mentions "The Gambler," which is a remake of "Aanaval Mothiram." It provides additional information about the film's influence and status, which could be useful for understanding the context of "Aanaval Mothiram." However, it is less directly related to the claim compared to the first two contexts. 4. "Ragalaipuram" context: This context is informative as it discusses "Ragalaipuram," another remake of "Aanaval Mothiram," but it is the least relevant to the claim since it does not provide direct information about the publication dates of the films in question.

Question:Which country the director of film Daadagiri is from?
golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is about identifying the country of the director of the film "Daadagiri." The reasoning steps provided are 'Daadagiri director Arshad Khan' and 'Arshad Khan country of citizenship Pakistan.' Based on these, the contexts should be ranked as follows:

1. Context idx 1: This context directly mentions "Daadagiri" and "Arshad Khan" as the director, which is highly relevant to the claim.
2. Context idx 6: Although this context is about Arshad Khan, it refers to a cricketer, not the director. However, it mentions Pakistan, which is relevant to the reasoning step regarding the country of citizenship.
3. Context idx 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9: These contexts mention various directors and their work but do not relate to "Daadagiri" or "Arshad Khan" as the director. They are therefore not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the reasoning steps, the ranking of the contexts is as follows:
idx: [1, 6, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim about the director of the film "Daadagiri". 1. Context 1: This context is directly related to the film "Daadagiri" and mentions Arshad Khan as the director, which matches the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context 6: Although this context is about a different Arshad Khan, it mentions that he is Pakistani, which is relevant to the reasoning steps. However, it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim since it's about a cricketer, not the director. 3. Context 4: This context mentions Brian Kennedy, who has worked in Australia, which could be misleading if not read carefully. However, it is less relevant to the claim. 4. Context 7: This context is about Peter Levin, an American director, which is not relevant to the claim but is included as it mentions a director. The other contexts are not relevant as they do not mention Arshad Khan or the film "Daadagiri".
idx: [1, 6, 4, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context 1 titled 'Daadagiri' is the most relevant as it directly mentions the film and the director Arshad Khan, which aligns with the reasoning steps. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim about the director's country of origin. 2. Context 6 titled 'Arshad Khan (cricketer)' is relevant because it mentions an Arshad Khan from Pakistan, which matches the reasoning step about the country of citizenship. However, it refers to a different Arshad Khan, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. Context 4 titled 'Brian Kennedy (gallery director)' is not directly relevant as it does not mention the film or the director in question. However, it is included because it mentions a director's professional background, which is tangentially related to the claim. 4. Context 7 titled 'Peter Levin' is the least relevant as it does not mention the film 'Daadagiri' or any Arshad Khan, and thus is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

2. Context 6: "Douglas Leiterman" - This context mentions Douglas Leiterman and his marriage to Beryl Fox, which is relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention Beryl Fox's place of birth.
3. Context 0: "Artaynte" - This context is about a different person and is not relevant to the claim.
4. Context 1: "Eunoë (wife of Bogudes)" - This context is about a different person and is not relevant to the claim.
5. Context 2: "Empress Shōken" - This context is about a different person and is not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer, the top 8 ranked contexts are:

idx: [4, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 4 "Beryl Fox": This context directly answers the claim by stating Beryl Fox's place of birth as Winnipeg, Manitoba. It matches perfectly with the reasoning steps and is highly relevant and informative. 2. Context idx 6 "Douglas Leiterman": This context is about Douglas Leiterman, Beryl Fox's spouse, and mentions their marriage. It is relevant as it provides background information on Beryl Fox, but does not directly answer the claim. 3. Context idx 7 "Lucy Kurtz": This context is about the wife of another individual and includes details about her life and death. It is less relevant to the claim but is included because it mentions a spouse's place of birth, which is related to the reasoning steps. 4. Context idx 3 "Catherine Exley": This context is about the wife of a soldier and includes biographical information. It is the least relevant but is included over others because it provides a narrative about a wife, which loosely connects to the reasoning steps.
idx: [4, 6, 7, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with idx 4 titled 'Beryl Fox': This context directly mentions Beryl Fox and states her place of birth as Winnipeg, Manitoba, which matches perfectly with the reasoning steps provided. It is highly relevant and informative, and it certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context with idx 6 titled 'Douglas Leiterman': This context mentions Douglas Leiterman's marriage to Beryl Fox and provides biographical information about him. While it does not directly state Beryl Fox's place of birth, it is relevant due to the mention of their marriage. 3. Context with idx 7 titled 'Lucy Kurtz': This context is about Lucy Kurtz, who has no direct connection to the claim regarding Beryl Fox. However, it is included because it mentions a spouse's details, which is a similar type of information sought in the claim, albeit about a different individual. Context with idx 3 titled 'Catherine Exley' is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Beryl Fox or Douglas Leiterman, nor does it provide any information that would lead to the answer to the claim.

Question:What is the place of birth of the performer of song Who...?
golden idx: [0, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the birthplace of Ayumi Hamasaki, the performer of the song "Who...". The reasoning steps provided are 'Who... performer Ayumi Hamasaki' and 'Ayumi Hamasaki place of birth Fukuoka'. Therefore, the contexts that directly mention Ayumi Hamasaki and her place of birth should be ranked highest. 

1. Context idx 0: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions Ayumi Hamasaki and states that she was "Born and raised in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture". It matches perfectly with the reasoning steps and is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.

2. Context idx 8: This context is relevant because it mentions the song "Who..." and Ayumi Hamasaki, providing information about the song's release and its details. However, it does not mention her place of birth, making it slightly less relevant than context idx 0.

3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a song titled "Who Knows" by Marion Black, which could potentially confuse with the song "Who..." by Ayumi Hamasaki due to the similar title. However, it does not provide information about Ayumi Hamasaki or her place of birth.

The remaining contexts do not mention Ayumi Hamasaki or the song "Who..." and are therefore not relevant to the claim. They are ranked based on the likelihood of a user mistakenly associating the content with the claim due to similar keywords or context.

4. Context idx 1: Mentions a singer and a song, but not related to the claim.
5. Context idx 2: Mentions a singer, but not related to the claim.
6. Context idx 3: Mentions a song and a story about lovers, which is not relevant to the claim.
7. Context idx 5: Mentions Tokyo, which is in Japan, but not related to the claim.
8. Context idx 6: Mentions a singer, but not related to the claim.

The contexts idx 7 and idx 9 are not included in the top 8 as they are the least relevant to the claim and reasoning steps.

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 0: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Ayumi Hamasaki's place of birth, Fukuoka, which matches perfectly with the reasoning steps. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context is about the song "Who..." by Ayumi Hamasaki. It is relevant because it is related to the performer in question, but it does not mention her place of birth. 3. Context idx 1: This context mentions Bernie Bonvoisin and his place of birth, which is not relevant to the claim about Ayumi Hamasaki. 4. Context idx 4: This context is about Marion Black and his song "Who Knows," which is not relevant to the claim about the song "Who..." by Ayumi Hamasaki.
idx: [0, 8, 1, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "Ayumi Hamasaki" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Ayumi Hamasaki and her place of birth, Fukuoka, which directly addresses the claim and the reasoning steps. It is informative and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Who..." context: This context is related to the song "Who..." performed by Ayumi Hamasaki. While it does not mention her place of birth, it is relevant to the performer of the song, which is part of the reasoning steps. 3.

idx: [1, 7, 4, 6]

Context 1 titled "Antonio Leonviola" is the most relevant as it directly mentions Antonio Leonviola and includes information about his association with "Libera Università del Cinema di Roma," which is located in Rome, aligning with the reasoning step mentioning his place of death. 2. Context 7 titled "Mole Men Against the Son of Hercules" is the second most relevant as it directly relates to the film mentioned in the claim and is directed by Antonio Leonviola, which could lead to more information about him. 3. Context 4 titled "Devil of the Desert Against the Son of Hercules" is less relevant as it is directed by Antonio Margheriti, not Leonviola, but it is related to the same series of films, which might contain useful information.

The reasoning steps provided are 'Sophia of Wittelsbach spouse Hermann I' and 'Hermann I father Louis II'. Therefore, we need contexts that mention Sophia's marriage to Hermann I and contexts that mention Hermann I's father, Louis II.
1. Context idx 8: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Sophia of Wittelsbach and her marriage to Hermann I, directly addressing the first reasoning step.
2. Context idx 1: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Hermann I and identifies his father as Louis II, which addresses the second reasoning step and is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 0: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses Ludwig von Westphalen, who is unrelated to Sophia of Wittelsbach.
4. Context idx 2: This context is also not relevant to the claim as it discusses Barthold A. Butenschøn Sr., who is unrelated to Sophia of Wittelsbach.

Based on the relevance to the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the contexts are ranked as follows:

idx: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Snowman (band)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Snowman (band)" and provides information about their origin from Australia, which matches one of the reasoning steps. 2. "Jessamine (band)" context: This context is equally relevant as it directly mentions "Jessamine (band)" and confirms their American origin, aligning with the other reasoning step. 3. "The Grapes (band)" context: While this context mentions an American band, it is less relevant because it does not pertain to "Jessamine (band)" but provides some context about American bands. 4. "Dentist (band)" context: This context also mentions an American band and provides additional context about the music scene in America, which is somewhat relevant to the claim. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not pertain to the bands in question or their countries of origin.

step-by-step think:1. "Snowman (band)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Snowman (band)" and provides information about their origin being Perth, Western Australia, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "The Grapes (band)" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions "The Grapes (band)," which is not part of the claim. However, it provides information about another American band, which might be slightly relevant due to the geographical aspect but is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Dentist (band)" context: This context is the least relevant as it mentions "Dentist (band)," which has no direct relation to the claim. It is informative about the band but does not contribute to answering the claim about the country of origin for Snowman and Jessamine.

Context 2: This context directly mentions "Benito Perojo" and "Madrid," which are both entities in the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context 9: This context mentions "Marianela," the film directed by Benito Perojo, and thus is relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention his place of birth. 3. Context 0-8: None of these contexts mention Benito Perojo or "Marianela," making them less relevant to the claim. They do not contain information about the director's place of birth, so they are unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [2, 9, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with index 2 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Benito Perojo and his place of birth, Madrid, which matches perfectly with the reasoning steps. 2. Context with index 9 is the second most relevant because it mentions Benito Perojo as the director of the film Marianela, which is directly related to the claim. 3. Contexts with indices 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Benito Perojo or the film Marianela. 4. Since there are only two contexts that are relevant to the claim, only these will be ranked.
idx: [2, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 2: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Benito Perojo and his place of birth, Madrid, which directly addresses the claim and the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 9: This context is relevant because it mentions the film "Marianela" and the director Benito Perojo, but it does not mention his place of birth. 3. Context idx 6: This context is less relevant as it mentions Brian Kennedy, a gallery director, but it does not relate to the claim or the reasoning steps. 4. Context idx 5: This context is about S.N. Mathur, who is a director but not related to the film industry or the claim. The other contexts (idx 0, 1, 3, 4) are not relevant as they do not mention Benito Perojo or the film "Marianela" and therefore do not contribute to answering the claim.

Question:Which film came out first, Repeated Absences or She Wore A Yellow Ribbon?
golden idx: [1, 2]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well the context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 
1. Context 1: "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" is directly mentioned with its release year, which matches one of the reasoning steps and is highly relevant to the claim. 
2. Context 2: "Repeated Absences" is directly mentioned with its release year, which matches the other reasoning step and is also highly relevant to the claim. 
3. Context 0: "Fort Apache (film)" mentions "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" in the context of being part of a trilogy, which is relevant but less direct than context 1. 
4. Context 3 and 6: "Rio Grande (film)" mentions "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" as part of the trilogy, which is relevant but does not provide the release year. 
5. Context 7: "Joanne Dru" mentions the actress's involvement in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," which is somewhat relevant but does not provide the release year. 
6. Context 9: "Rudy Bowman" mentions the actor's appearance in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," which is somewhat relevant but does not provide the release year. 
7. Context 4: "The Night of Nights" is not relevant to the claim. 
8. Context 5: "The Fabulous Senorita" is not relevant to the claim. 
9. Context 8: "Operation Leopard" is not relevant to the claim.

idx: [1, 2, 0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 4]

step-by-step think: To determine which film came out first, we need to compare the publication dates provided in the reasoning steps. 1. "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the film and provides detailed information about its release and content, including the year it was made, which is 1949. This matches the reasoning step that cites the film's publication date as 1950, which is likely a reference to its award recognition rather than its release. 2. "Repeated Absences" context: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions the film and its publication date of 1972, confirming the reasoning step. 3. "Fort Apache (film)" context: While this context is about a different film, it is relevant because it mentions "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" as part of the trilogy, providing additional context about the film series. 4. "Rio Grande (film)" context: This context is relevant as it mentions "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" and provides information about the trilogy, which helps to establish the timeline of the films. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not provide direct information about the publication dates of the films in question.
idx: [1, 2, 0, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the film "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" and provides detailed information about its release year, which is 1949, matching one of the reasoning steps. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Repeated Absences" context: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions the film "Repeated Absences" and states its publication date as 1972, which aligns with the reasoning steps. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Rio Grande (film)" context: While this context does not directly address the claim, it mentions "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" as part of the trilogy, which is related to the claim. It provides additional information about the series of films, which could be useful for understanding the context of the claim.

Question:Who lived longer, Edward Dearle or Michael Doeberl?
golden idx: [0, 5]
step-by-step think: To determine who lived longer, Edward Dearle or Michael Doeberl, we need to compare their lifespans using the dates of birth and death provided in the reasoning steps. Edward Dearle was born on 2 March 1806 and died on 20 March 1891, which means he lived for 85 years and 18 days. Michael Doeberl was born on 15 January 1861 and died on 24 March 1928, which means he lived for 67 years and 69 days. Therefore, Edward Dearle lived longer. Now, to rank the contexts, we need to consider the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. Context 0 directly mentions Edward Dearle's birth and death dates, making it highly relevant. Context 5 directly mentions Michael Doeberl's birth and death dates, also making it highly relevant. The other contexts do not mention the individuals in question or relevant dates, making them less relevant. Thus, the ranking is as follows based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.
idx: [0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To determine who lived longer, we need to calculate the lifespan of Edward Dearle and Michael Doeberl using their birth and death dates. 1. Context 0 provides the exact birth and death dates for Edward Dearle, which are directly relevant to the claim. 2. Context 5 gives the precise birth and death dates for Michael Doeberl, which are necessary to answer the claim. 3. Context 6 mentions another Michael with dates that are close but not relevant to the claim. 4. Context 2 mentions a historical figure named Michael but with different dates that are not pertinent to the claim. Contexts 1, 3, 4, and 7 are not relevant because they do not provide information about the individuals in question.
idx: [0, 5, 6, 2]

step-by-step think: To determine who lived longer, we need to calculate the lifespan of Edward Dearle and Michael Doeberl based on their birth and death dates. 1. Context 0 (Edward Dearle): This context is highly relevant as it provides both the birth and death dates of Edward Dearle, which are essential to answer the claim. 2. Context 5 (Michael Doeberl): This context is equally relevant because it provides the birth and death dates of Michael Doeberl, allowing us to compare the lifespans of the two individuals. 3. Context 6 (Michał Kruszka) and Context 2 (Michael the Syrian): These contexts are not relevant to the claim as they pertain to different individuals who are not part of the comparison.

It is likely to contain the answer to the claim due to the direct relationship mentioned. 3. Context idx 7: This context is less relevant as it does not mention the United Nations or any direct relationship to Thorvald Stoltenberg's employment but is included due to the mention of a spouse's contribution to their partner's work. 4. Context idx 3: This context is also less relevant but is included because it mentions the work of a spouse, which is a theme related to the claim.
idx: [6, 1, 7, 3]

However, it does not provide specific information about Thorvald's employer, making it less likely to contain the answer than context idx 6. 3. Context idx 7: This context is about Mary Horner Lyell and does not mention Thorvald Stoltenberg or the United Nations. It is not relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 3: This context is about J.A. Lawrence and also does not mention Thorvald Stoltenberg or the United Nations. It is not relevant to the claim.

Question:Where was the director of film Lettre Ouverte born?
golden idx: [2, 4]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the reasoning steps and the claim. The claim is about the birthplace of Alex Joffé, director of the film "Lettre Ouverte," and the reasoning steps include his name and the place of birth, Paris. 

1. Context 2 ("Alex Joffé") directly mentions Alex Joffé and states he was born in Alexandria, Egypt, which is crucial information for the claim, even though it doesn't match the reasoning step's mention of Paris.
2. Context 4 ("Lettre ouverte") is highly relevant as it mentions the film directed by Alex Joffé, which is directly related to the claim.
3. Context 0 ("Ahmed Baba Miské") mentions "Lettre ouverte" but is about a different person, making it less relevant than contexts about Alex Joffé.
4. Context 1 ("Brian Kennedy (gallery director)") is not relevant to the claim as it's about a different director.
5. Context 3 ("S. N. Mathur") is not relevant to the claim.
6. Context 5 ("Olav Aaraas") is not relevant to the claim.
7. Context 6 ("Jesse E. Hobson") is not relevant to the claim.
8. Context 7 ("Peter Levin") is not relevant to the claim.
9. Context 8 ("Dana Blankstein") is not relevant to the claim.
10. Context 9 ("Ian Barry (director)") is not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the ranking is as follows:

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 2: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions Alex Joffé and provides information about his birthplace, which is the answer to the claim. 2.

However, it does not provide information about his birthplace. 3.

Context idx 1: This context talks about Brian Kennedy, another director, and mentions his birthplace, which shows relevance to the topic of directors' birthplaces but is not about Alex Joffé.
idx: [2, 4, 5, 1]

"Alex Joffé" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Alex Joffé, the director of "Lettre Ouverte," and provides information about his birthplace, which directly addresses the claim. 2. "Lettre ouverte" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the film directed by Alex Joffé, which is related to the claim.

Question:Who was born earlier, Silas Hardy or Lee Mantle?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born earlier between Silas Hardy and Lee Mantle, we need to compare their dates of birth. The context that mentions Silas Hardy's date of birth, 30 April 1867, is most relevant. Similarly, the context mentioning Lee Mantle's date of birth, December 13, 1851, is also highly relevant. Therefore, these two contexts will be ranked highest. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the dates of birth for these individuals or contain information about different people with similar names. Hence, they will be ranked lower based on the lack of direct relevance to the claim.
idx: [6, 4, 7, 2, 0, 1, 3, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born earlier between Silas Hardy and Lee Mantle, I will rank the contexts based on the birth dates provided in the reasoning steps. 1. "Lee Mantle" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth date of Lee Mantle, which is directly related to the claim. 2. "Silas Hardy" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the exact birth date of Silas Hardy, necessary to answer the claim. 3. "Silas H. Strawn" context: This context is less relevant because, despite sharing a similar name, it refers to a different person and does not provide information that can answer the claim. 4. "Arthur Sherburne Hardy" context: This context is relevant to the extent that it shares a surname with Silas Hardy, but it does not provide information that can answer the claim about the birth dates of Silas Hardy or Lee Mantle.
idx: [4, 6, 7, 2]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born earlier between Silas Hardy and Lee Mantle, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are 'Silas Hardy date of birth 30 April 1867' and 'Lee Mantle date of birth December 13, 1851'. Therefore, we need to find the contexts that mention these dates.
1. Context idx 4 ("Lee Mantle"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Lee Mantle's date of birth directly, which is December 13, 1851. This context is informative and directly answers the part of the claim regarding Lee Mantle's birth date.
2. Context idx 6 ("Silas Hardy"): This context is also highly relevant as it mentions Silas Hardy's date of birth directly, which is 30 April 1867. This context is informative and directly answers the part of the claim regarding Silas Hardy's birth date.
3. Context idx 7 ("Silas H. Strawn"): This context is less relevant because it mentions a different person, Silas H. Strawn, who has a similar name to Silas Hardy but is not the same individual. However, it does provide a date of birth, December 15, 1866, which is close to the reasoning step for Silas Hardy.
4. Context idx 2 ("Arthur Sherburne Hardy"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either Silas Hardy or Lee Mantle.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the top 3 ranked contexts are:

Question:What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 

1. Context idx 3: This context is directly related to Namie Amuro and mentions her place of birth as Naha, Okinawa, which matches perfectly with the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 5: This context is about the song "Heaven" by Namie Amuro. While it does not mention her place of birth, it is relevant to the performer of the song, which is part of the claim.
3. Context idx 1: The title includes the word "Heaven" and could be misleadingly relevant, but the paragraph text does not match the reasoning steps or the claim.
4. Context idx 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9: None of these contexts are relevant to Namie Amuro or her song "Heaven," nor do they mention her place of birth.

Given the above considerations, the contexts can be ranked as follows:
idx: [3, 5, 1, 0, 2, 4, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 3 ("Namie Amuro"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Namie Amuro's place of birth, which is Naha, Okinawa, Japan. It matches perfectly with the reasoning steps and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 5 ("Heaven (Namie Amuro song)"): This context is relevant because it discusses the song "Heaven" by Namie Amuro. However, it does not mention her place of birth, making it less relevant than context idx 3. 3. Context idx 1 ("Vic Coppersmith-Heaven"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different person with the surname 'Heaven' and does not provide information about Namie Amuro. 4. Context idx 7 ("Caspar Babypants"): This context is not directly relevant to the claim but is included because it mentions a musician's stage name, which is a weak connection to the claim about a performer's place of birth. The other contexts (idx 0, 2, 4, 6) are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Namie Amuro or her song "Heaven".
idx: [3, 5, 1, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Namie Amuro" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Namie Amuro and provides detailed information about her birthplace, which is Naha, Okinawa, Japan. It matches perfectly with the reasoning steps and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Heaven (Namie Amuro song)" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the song "Heaven" by Namie Amuro. While it does not mention her place of birth, it is related to the performer in question and the song mentioned in the claim. 3. "Vic Coppersmith-Heaven" context: This context is less relevant as it does not mention Namie Amuro or her place of birth. However, it includes the word "Heaven" in the title, which is part of the claim but in a different context. 4. "Caspar Babypants" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention Namie Amuro, the song "Heaven," or her place of birth. It is unrelated to the claim.

Question:What nationality is Philip Of Ibelin (1180–1227)'s mother?
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: To determine the nationality of Philip of Ibelin's mother, Maria Komnene, we need to identify contexts that mention her and her country of citizenship. 1. Context 0 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Maria Komnene, her role as Queen of Jerusalem, and her Byzantine heritage. 2. Context 2 is the next most relevant because it identifies Maria Komnene as the mother of Philip of Ibelin and mentions her Byzantine connection. 3. Context 7 is relevant as it mentions Maria Komnene as the dowager Queen of Jerusalem and provides information about her family. 4. Context 1 is somewhat relevant as it mentions Philip of Ibelin and his family, which could indirectly provide information about his mother's nationality. 5. Context 9 is less directly related but mentions the Ibelin family and their connections, which might provide further context to Maria Komnene's background. 6. Context 4 mentions the Ibelin family and could offer additional background information. 7. Context 6 mentions the Ibelin family and their status in Cyprus, which is less directly related but still informative. 8. Context 3 mentions the Ibelin family but is the least relevant to the specific question of Maria Komnene's nationality.
idx: [0, 2, 7, 1, 9, 4, 6, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 0: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Maria Komnene directly, provides information about her lineage, and connects her to the Byzantine Empire, which is crucial for determining her nationality. 2. Context idx 2: This context is also relevant because it mentions Philip of Ibelin and identifies Maria Komnene as his mother, linking her to the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Byzantine heritage. 3. Context idx 7: This context is relevant as it mentions Maria Komnene as the mother of Helvis of Ibelin and provides additional family context, which may help in deducing Maria's nationality. 4. Context idx 1: This context is less directly related to the claim but still relevant as it mentions the Ibelin family and provides information about other family members, which could indirectly help in determining Maria Komnene's nationality.
idx: [0, 2, 7, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. Context 0 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Maria Komnene's Byzantine heritage and her role as the mother of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem, which is closely related to the claim about Philip of Ibelin's mother's nationality. 2. Context 2 is the second most relevant because it mentions Philip of Ibelin and his mother Maria Komnene, establishing their relationship and her position in the Crusader nobility of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. 3. Context 7 is relevant as it mentions Maria Komnene as the mother of Helvis of Ibelin and her status as the dowager Queen of Jerusalem, which provides additional context about her family and lineage. Context 1 is less relevant as it focuses on John of Ibelin and does not mention Maria Komnene's nationality or heritage.

Question:Who was born later, Joseph J. Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş?
golden idx: [1, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born later between Joseph J. Magliocco and Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are 'Joseph J. Magliocco date of birth October 14, 1957', and 'Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş date of birth 19 June 1998'. Therefore, the contexts that directly mention these individuals and their dates of birth are most relevant.

1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Joseph J. Magliocco and his date of birth, directly matching one of the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 7: This context is equally relevant because it mentions Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş and her date of birth, directly matching the other reasoning step.
3. Context idx 9: This context mentions a different Joseph Magliocco, but it is still relevant due to the name match; however, the date of birth is different, so it's less relevant than the first two contexts.
4. Context idx 8: This context mentions Joseph Magliocco in a different context, which is less relevant than the direct mentions of the individuals' birth dates but still contains a name match.
5. Context idx 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: These contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention either of the individuals or their birth dates.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the ranking is as follows:
idx: [1, 7, 9, 8, 0, 2, 3, 4]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 7: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş and her date of birth, which is one of the entities in the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 1: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions Joseph J. Magliocco and his date of birth, which is the other entity in the reasoning steps. 3. Context idx 9: This context mentions Joseph Magliocco, but the dates and context refer to a different individual with a similar name, which might cause confusion. However, it is still somewhat relevant due to the name match. 4. Context idx 8: This context mentions Joseph Magliocco in the paragraph text, but it refers to a character portrayal, not the actual person of interest. It is less relevant than the contexts that directly mention the actual individuals in question.
idx: [7,1,9,8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş" context: This context directly matches the reasoning step mentioning Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş's date of birth, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Joseph J. Magliocco" context: This context directly matches the reasoning step mentioning Joseph J. Magliocco's date of birth, making it relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Joseph Magliocco" context: This context is about a different Joseph Magliocco, born in 1898, which is not relevant to the claim about the two individuals in question. 4. "Louis Guss" context: This context mentions Joseph Magliocco in an acting role, which is not relevant to the claim about the birth dates of the individuals in question.

idx: [2, 9, 4, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Ben Weinman" context: This context directly mentions Ben Weinman and provides his date of birth, which is the exact answer to the claim. It is highly relevant and informative. 2. "List of The Dillinger Escape Plan band members" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Ben Weinman as a part of the band and provides extensive information about the band's history and members. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim because it discusses the band members in detail. 3. "Jeff Tuttle" context: This context is less directly related to the claim but mentions Jeff Tuttle's involvement with The Dillinger Escape Plan, which shows relevance to the band. However, it does not provide information about Ben Weinman's birthday. 4.

Context 2 mentions 'The Doolins of Oklahoma' as an American Western film, which matches the other reasoning step. These two contexts are the most relevant and likely contain the answer to the claim. The other contexts mention various individuals and locations related to Oklahoma, but they do not provide information about the country of origin of the movies in question. Therefore, they are less relevant to the claim.

Context 3: This context mentions 'Out of the Rain' and its publication date of 1991, which is also directly relevant to the claim. 3. Context 4: Although 'Archives du Féminisme' does not provide the publication date of 'Les Résultats du féminisme', it is related to the topic of feminism and might contain historical data relevant to the claim. 4. Context 1: 'Lady Cops' or 'Les Keufs' is a French film and, while not directly related to the claim, it shares the language and cultural context which might be informative. 5. Context 2: 'The Little Wheedlers' or 'Les petits câlins' is another French film that could potentially contain information about French cinema history, including 'Les Résultats du féminisme'. 6. Context 8: 'LES' may refer to 'Les', which is a common abbreviation in French titles, but this context is less likely to contain the answer. 7. Context 5: 'Rain or Shine' may refer to various topics, and while not directly related, it could contain information about the film 'Out Of The Rain'. 8. Context 0: 'Rain or Shine Elasto Painters all-time roster' is unrelated to the films but shares a keyword with 'Out Of The Rain'.

"Lady Cops" context: This context mentions a French film and its director, which may be somewhat relevant due to the geographical and cultural proximity to the films in question, but it does not provide information on the publication dates of either film. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the films in question and do not provide information on publication dates, making them less relevant.

It is less relevant than the contexts that directly mention the films in question but still informative. 4. "Coney Island Baby (film)" context: This context provides a publication date for a different film, which is not directly relevant to the claim but could be informative in a broader discussion about film release dates. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts that directly mention "Xenoa" and "Divorce Invitation."
idx: [4, 3, 6, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "Xenoa" context: This context directly relates to the claim as it mentions "Xenoa" and provides the specific publication date of 2007, which is one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Divorce Invitation" context: This context is also directly related to the claim, mentioning "Divorce Invitation" and its publication date of 2012, aligning with the second reasoning step. It is relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Aahvaanam" context: While this context does not directly address the claim, it provides background information on "Divorce Invitation," including its original version and the year it was remade, which is indirectly related to the claim.

idx: [3,0,2,1,4,7,5,6]

step-by-step think: 1. Context 3 titled "Charles Martel" is the most relevant as it directly mentions Charles Martel and provides information about his place of birth, Herstal, which is directly related to the claim. 2. Context 0 titled "Remigius of Rouen" is the second most relevant as it mentions Remigius being the son of Charles Martel, which is part of the reasoning steps. 3. Context 1 titled "Nicasius of Rouen" and context 4 titled "Flavius of Rouen" are less directly related to the claim but are relevant to the location, Rouen, which is associated with Remigius. They are ranked based on the likelihood of containing information about the lineage of Remigius due to their historical context. 4. The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Charles Martel or Herstal, nor do they have a direct connection to Remigius of Rouen.
idx: [3, 0, 1, 4]

Question:Which school was established first, Whitehorse Manor Junior School or Sabawoon Rehabilitation Centre?
golden idx: [3, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine which school was established first, we need to compare the inception dates of Whitehorse Manor Junior School and Sabawoon Rehabilitation Centre. According to the reasoning steps, Whitehorse Manor Junior School was established in 2011, while Sabawoon Rehabilitation Centre was established in 2009. Therefore, we will rank the contexts that contain information about these two institutions first, as they are directly relevant to the claim.

1. Context idx 3: This context is about Whitehorse Manor Junior School and mentions its inception in April 2011, which is directly relevant to the claim.
2. Context idx 9: This context is about Sabawoon Rehabilitation Centre and mentions its inauguration in 2009, which is directly relevant to the claim.
3. Context idx 5: Although this context is about Bramcote School and mentions a date (2012), it is not directly relevant to the claim but is included because it mentions a specific date related to a school's establishment.
4. Context idx 0: This context is about Edinburgh Collegiate School and mentions its establishment in 1868, which is not directly relevant to the claim but is included because it mentions a specific date related to a school's establishment.
5. Context idx 1: This context is about Chisipite Junior School and mentions its founding in 1929, which is not directly relevant to the claim but is included because it mentions a specific date related to a school's establishment.
6. Context idx 8: This context is about Joshi Seigakuin Junior & Senior High School and mentions its establishment in 1905, which is not directly relevant to the claim but is included because it mentions a specific date related to a school's establishment.
7. Context idx 6: This context is about Flagg Grove School and mentions its establishment in the late 19th century, which is not directly relevant to the claim but is included because it mentions a specific date related to a school's establishment.
8. Context idx 2: This context is about Royal Preparatory School and does not mention a specific date, making it less relevant than the contexts that do mention specific dates.

The remaining contexts do not mention specific dates or relevant information to the claim and are therefore not included in the top 8 ranked contexts.

idx: [3, 9, 5, 0, 1, 8, 6, 2]

step-by-step think: The task is to determine which school was established first between Whitehorse Manor Junior School and Sabawoon Rehabilitation Centre. According to the reasoning steps, Whitehorse Manor Junior School's inception was in 2011, and Sabawoon Rehabilitation Centre's inception was in 2009. Therefore, the context that mentions the inception of Sabawoon Rehabilitation Centre is most relevant and should be ranked highest as it directly answers the claim. The context mentioning the inception of Whitehorse Manor Junior School is also relevant and should be ranked second. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim since they do not pertain to the schools in question.
idx: [9, 3, 5, 0]

step-by-step think: The claim requires establishing which institution was founded first. The reasoning steps provide the inception years for both institutions. 1. 'Sabawoon Rehabilitation Centre' context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the exact year of establishment, 2009, which is one of the entities in the reasoning steps. It directly answers the claim by providing the necessary information to determine which institution was established first. 2. 'Whitehorse Manor Junior School' context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions the school's inception year, 2011, which is directly related to the claim and the reasoning steps. It provides the necessary information to compare the establishment dates of the two institutions. 3. 'Edinburgh Collegiate School' context: Although this context provides an establishment year, it is not relevant to the claim since it does not pertain to either of the institutions in question. However, it is ranked third because it does mention an inception year, which is a type of information relevant to the claim. 'Bramcote School' context is not relevant to the claim as it does not provide any information about the establishment dates of the institutions in question.

Question:Are Little Sachigo Lake and Holden Lake located in the same country?
golden idx: [5, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is about whether Little Sachigo Lake and Holden Lake are located in the same country. The reasoning steps provided are 'Little Sachigo Lake country Canada' and 'Holden Lake country Canada', which means I need to look for contexts that confirm both lakes are in Canada. 1. Context idx 5: This context directly mentions 'Little Sachigo Lake' and confirms its location in Ontario, Canada, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: This context directly mentions 'Holden Lake' and confirms its location in Ontario, Canada, which is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 0: While this context talks about Sachigo Lake and not 'Little Sachigo Lake' specifically, it is still relevant due to the geographical proximity and the mention of Canada. 4. Context idx 1: 'Green Lake (Ontario)' is mentioned as being in Ontario, Canada, which is relevant due to the geographical location but less so than the contexts that mention the specific lakes in question. 5. Context idx 2: 'McEvoy Lake' is in Yukon, Canada, which is less relevant than the Ontario lakes but still in the same country. 6. Context idx 3: 'Swan Lake (Manitoba)' is in Manitoba, Canada, again less relevant than the Ontario lakes but confirming the country. 7. Context idx 8: 'Rush Lake (Minnesota)' is in the United States, which is not relevant to the claim about Canadian lakes. 8. Context idx 9: 'Wanetta Lake' is on Vancouver Island, which is in Canada, but the context is less relevant than those mentioning Ontario.
idx: [5,7,0,1,2,3,9,8]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: "Little Sachigo Lake" is directly mentioned in the reasoning steps and the context provides detailed information about its location in Canada, making it highly relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: "Holden Lake" is also mentioned in the reasoning steps and the context confirms its location in Ontario, Canada, which is crucial for answering the claim. 3. Context idx 0: "Sachigo Lake" is related to "Little Sachigo Lake" and provides additional geographical context about the area, which could be useful for understanding the claim. 4. Context idx 1: "Green Lake (Ontario)" is another lake located in Ontario, Canada, and while not directly mentioned in the reasoning steps, it is relevant due to the geographical proximity and similar naming convention.
idx: [5, 7, 0, 1]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 5 - "Little Sachigo Lake": This context is highly relevant as it matches one of the entities in the reasoning steps and provides detailed information about Little Sachigo Lake's location in Canada. 2. Context idx 7 - "Holden Lake": This context is also relevant because it confirms Holden Lake's location in Ontario, Canada, which is necessary to answer the claim. 3. Context idx 0 - "Sachigo Lake": While this context is about Sachigo Lake and not directly about Little Sachigo Lake or Holden Lake, it is still relevant due to the geographical proximity and shared drainage basin, which supports the claim that both lakes are in the same country.

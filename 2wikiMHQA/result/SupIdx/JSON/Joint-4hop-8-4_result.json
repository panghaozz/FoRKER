His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.

His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures, in particular homosexuality; as such, Van Sant is considered one of the most prominent auteurs of the New Queer Cinema movement. Van Sant\\'s early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the Pacific Northwest. He made his feature-length cinematic directorial debut with \"Mala Noche\" (1985). His second feature \"Drugstore Cowboy\" (1989) was highly acclaimed, and earned Van Sant screenwriting awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and New York Film Critics Circle and the award for Best Director from the National Society of Film Critics. His following film, \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991), was similarly praised, as was the black comedy \"To Die For\" (1995), the drama \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997), and the biographical film \"Milk\" (2008); for the latter two, Van Sant was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and both films received Best Picture nominations. In 2003, Van Sant\\'s film about the Columbine High School massacre, \"Elephant\", won the Palme d\\'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Van Sant also received the festival\\'s Best Director Award that same year, making him one of only two filmmakers\u2014the other being Joel Coen\u2014to win both accolades at the festival in the same year.

In addition to directing, Van Sant has written the screenplays for several of his earlier works, and is the author of a novel entitled \"Pink\".

The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike\\'s hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike\\'s mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy\\'s 1963 novel\" City of Night\" and concluding that Rechy\\'s treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott\\'s story as a modern update of the\" Henry IV\" plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other\\'s behalf. \" My Own Private Idaho\" had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of\" The New York Times\" and\" Entertainment Weekly\". The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics. \" My Own Private Idaho\" is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer- themed independent filmmaking.

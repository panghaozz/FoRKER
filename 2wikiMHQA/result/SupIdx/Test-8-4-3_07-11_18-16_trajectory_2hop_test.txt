Question:What is the date of death of Gero Ii, Margrave Of The Saxon Ostmark's father?
golden idx: [1, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the date of death of Gero II's father, Thietmar. The reasoning steps provided are clear: we need to find the context that mentions Thietmar, Margrave of Meissen, and his date of death. Context 1 is the most relevant because it directly mentions Thietmar and his date of death, which is the answer to the claim. Context 5 is the second most relevant because it mentions Gero II and his relation to Thietmar, providing background information that supports the claim. Context 3 mentions a Henry II, Margrave of Meissen, but does not provide information about Thietmar; however, it is still somewhat relevant due to the mention of Meissen. Context 2 is relevant as it mentions Thietmar, but it does not provide the date of death. The remaining contexts are less relevant because they do not mention Thietmar or the Saxon Ostmark directly.
idx: [1, 5, 3, 2, 0, 4, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 1: This context directly mentions "Thietmar, Margrave of Meissen" and provides the exact date of death, which is the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 5: This context mentions Gero II and his relation to Thietmar, providing background information that supports the claim. 3. Context idx 3: This context provides information about Odo I, who is related to the family in question, and gives historical context that might be relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 2: This context talks about Henry II, Margrave of Meissen, and while it does not directly answer the claim, it is related to the same lineage and could provide additional context.
idx: [1, 5, 3, 2]

step-by-step think:1. Context 1 titled "Thietmar, Margrave of Meissen" directly addresses the claim by mentioning Thietmar and providing the exact date of death, which is the answer to the question. 2. Context 5 titled "Gero II, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark" is relevant as it mentions Gero II being the son of Thietmar, which is a direct relationship to the claim. However, it does not mention Thietmar's date of death. 3. Context 3 titled "Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark" is less relevant as it discusses Odo I and does not mention Thietmar's date of death, but it is informative about the family relations and historical context. 4. Context 2 titled "Henry II, Margrave of Meissen" is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Thietmar or his date of death.

Question:Are Tomskoye, Amur Oblast and Pleshkovo located in the same country?
golden idx: [0, 5]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to establish the countries in which Tomskoye, Amur Oblast and Pleshkovo are located. The reasoning steps provided are 'Tomskoye, Amur Oblast country Russia' and 'Pleshkovo country Russia'. Therefore, we should prioritize contexts that mention these localities and their association with Russia.

1. Context 0 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Tomskoye, Amur Oblast, and confirms it is in Russia.
2. Context 5 is the second most relevant because it directly mentions Pleshkovo and its location in Russia.
3. Context 1 mentions Konstantinovka in Amur Oblast, which is relevant due to the mention of Amur Oblast.
4. Context 2 mentions Poyarkovo in Amur Oblast, also relevant due to the mention of Amur Oblast.
5. Context 3 mentions Gulikovka in Amur Oblast, adding to the relevance due to the mention of Amur Oblast.
6. Context 4 mentions Tambovka in Amur Oblast, which is relevant for the same reason as above.
7. Context 6 mentions Bon in Amur Oblast, again relevant due to the mention of Amur Oblast.
8. Context 7 mentions Yekaterinoslavka in Amur Oblast, which is relevant as well.

The remaining contexts do not mention the specific localities in question or Amur Oblast and are therefore not ranked within the top 8.

idx: [0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 0: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Tomskoye, Amur Oblast" and provides specific information about its location in Russia, matching one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 5: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions "Pleshkovo" and specifies its location in Russia, aligning with the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 1: While this context talks about "Konstantinovka, Amur Oblast," it is less relevant because it does not match the entities in the reasoning steps but is still informative about a location in Russia. 4. Context idx 2: Similar to idx 1, this context discusses "Poyarkovo, Amur Oblast," which is in the same region as Tomskoye but does not directly address the reasoning steps.
idx: [0, 5, 1, 2]

step-by-step think: 1. "Tomskoye, Amur Oblast" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Tomskoye, Amur Oblast" and confirms its location in Russia, matching one of the reasoning steps. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Pleshkovo" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions "Pleshkovo" and confirms its location in Russia, although in a different region (Altai Krai), which matches the other reasoning step. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Konstantinovka, Amur Oblast" context: While this context is relevant to the Amur Oblast region of Russia, it does not mention either Tomskoye or Pleshkovo. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention the localities in question. 4. "Poyarkovo, Amur Oblast" context: Similar to the previous context, it is relevant to Amur Oblast but does not mention the specific localities of interest, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "I Am Breathing" context: This context directly relates to the claim as it mentions "I Am Breathing" and provides the publication date of 2013, which is the other reasoning step. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 3.

It is informative but less relevant. 8. "XX/XY" context: This context is about a film from 2002, which is later than both films in question and does not directly relate to the claim. It is informative but less relevant.
idx: [1,9,4,8,3,6,5,7]

step-by-step think:1. "Ulti Ganga" context: This context directly addresses the claim by providing the release year of the film "Ulti Ganga," which is 1942. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "I Am Breathing" context: This context is also directly relevant as it provides the release year of "I Am Breathing," which is 2013. It is informative and contains the answer to the claim. 3. "The Night of Nights" context: While this context provides a release year for a different film, it is not directly relevant to the claim. However, it does provide a date, which shows an understanding of the type of information needed to answer the claim. 4. "When the Mountains Tremble" context: This context provides a release year for another film, which is not directly related to the claim but is still informative regarding film release dates. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not provide direct information about the films in question or their release dates.
idx: [1, 9, 4, 8]

step-by-step think: The task is to determine which film, "I Am Breathing" or "Ulti Ganga," was released earlier. The reasoning steps provided are the publication dates for both films: "I Am Breathing" in 2013 and "Ulti Ganga" in 1942. Therefore, the contexts need to be ranked based on how well they match these entities and dates, their relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 1 ("Ulti Ganga"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the title "Ulti Ganga" and confirms its release year as 1942, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
   
2. Context idx 9 ("I Am Breathing"): This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions the title "I Am Breathing" and provides its release year as 2013, matching the other reasoning step. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim.

3. Context idx 4 ("The Night of Nights"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film entirely, with no direct connection to the films in question.

4. Context idx 8 ("When the Mountains Tremble"): Similar to context idx 4, this context is about a different film and does not relate to the claim about the release dates of "I Am Breathing" or "Ulti Ganga."

Based on the rules for ranking, the top 3 contexts in order of relevance and likelihood of containing the answer are contexts idx 1, idx 9, and then idx 4, as it at least provides information about a film's release date, even though it's not directly related to the claim.

Question:Who was born later, Levon Julfalakyan or Charlotte Spurkeland?
golden idx: [4, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born later between Levon Julfalakyan and Charlotte Spurkeland, I need to rank the contexts based on the provided dates of birth. Context 4 directly mentions Charlotte Spurkeland's date of birth as 12 August 1987, which is crucial for answering the claim. Context 9 mentions Levon Julfalakyan's date of birth as 5 April 1964, which is also essential. The other contexts do not contain relevant information regarding the dates of birth of the individuals in question. Therefore, they will be ranked lower. The contexts that mention the names but not the dates of birth will be ranked next, followed by those that are completely unrelated.
idx: [4, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born later between Levon Julfalakyan and Charlotte Spurkeland, we need to compare their dates of birth. 1. "Charlotte Spurkeland" context: This context directly mentions Charlotte Spurkeland and provides her date of birth as 12 August 1987, which is essential for answering the claim. 2. "Levon Julfalakyan" context: This context directly mentions Levon Julfalakyan and provides his date of birth as 5 April 1964, which is necessary to compare with Charlotte Spurkeland's date of birth. The other contexts mention different individuals and are not relevant to the claim. Therefore, they are ranked lower.
idx: [4, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born later between Levon Julfalakyan and Charlotte Spurkeland, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provide the necessary information: Levon Julfalakyan was born on 5 April 1964, and Charlotte Spurkeland was born on 12 August 1987. Therefore, Charlotte Spurkeland was born later. 

Now, to rank the contexts, we need to find the ones that mention these individuals and their dates of birth. Context 9 directly mentions Levon Julfalakyan and his date of birth, making it highly relevant. Context 4 mentions Charlotte Spurkeland and her date of birth, which is also highly relevant. The other contexts do not pertain to the claim as they do not mention the individuals in question or their dates of birth.

Thus, the ranking based on relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer is as follows:
1. Context 4: Directly mentions Charlotte Spurkeland and her date of birth.
2. Context 9: Directly mentions Levon Julfalakyan and his date of birth.

The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim, as they do not mention either individual or their dates of birth. However, they will be ranked based on the presence of any related terms or potential indirect relevance:
3. Context 5: Mentions the name Charlotte, but not Spurkeland.
4. Context 6: Mentions the name Charlotte, but not Spurkeland.
5. Context 2: Mentions the name Charlotte, but not Spurkeland.
6. Context 1: Mentions the name Catherine, which is not relevant to the claim.
7. Context 3: Mentions the name Charlotte, but not Spurkeland.
8. Context 7: Does not mention any relevant names but is the next in line by default.

The contexts that are least relevant are not listed as only the top 8 are required.

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim about Boris Nemtsov's place of birth. 1. Context 0 ("Boris Nemtsov"): This context is highly relevant as it is entirely about Boris Nemtsov, Zhanna Nemtsova's father. However, it does not mention his place of birth. 2. Context 5 ("Zhanna Nemtsova"): This context is directly related to Zhanna Nemtsova and mentions her father, Boris Nemtsov, which makes it relevant. However, it also does not mention his place of birth. 3. The remaining contexts (6, 9, 7, 8, 3, 4) do not mention Boris Nemtsov or his place of birth and are therefore not relevant to the claim. 
idx: [0, 5, 6, 9]

step-by-step think:1. Context with index 0 titled 'Boris Nemtsov' is the most relevant as it provides extensive information about Boris Nemtsov, who is Zhanna Nemtsova's father. The paragraph text does not explicitly mention his place of birth, but given the depth of information, it is likely to contain the answer. 2. Context with index 5 titled 'Zhanna Nemtsova' is directly related to Zhanna Nemtsova and mentions her father, Boris Nemtsov. However, it does not provide information about his place of birth. 3.

Question:Which country the composer of film Continental, A Film Without Guns is from?
golden idx: [7, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is about identifying the country of the composer of the film "Continental, A Film Without Guns". The reasoning steps suggest that the composer is Stéphane Lafleur and that he is French. Therefore, the contexts that mention Stéphane Lafleur and his connection to the film, as well as his nationality, are most relevant.
1. Context idx 7: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Stéphane Lafleur and describes him as a French-Canadian, which directly addresses the claim.
2. Context idx 9: This context is relevant because it mentions the film "Continental, A Film Without Guns" and credits Stéphane Lafleur as the director and writer, which supports the claim.
3. Context idx 6: This context mentions a Canadian actor who won an award for his role in "Continental, A Film Without Guns", which indirectly supports the claim by associating the film with Canada.
4. Context idx 3: This context mentions a French composer of film scores, which is relevant to the claim but does not directly address the composer in question.
5. Context idx 1: This context mentions a German composer of film scores, which is less relevant as it does not match the nationality mentioned in the reasoning steps.

Context idx 6: This context mentions the film and an award related to it, which makes it somewhat relevant, but it does not mention Stéphane Lafleur's nationality or role as a composer. 4. Context idx 3: This context mentions a French composer, which could be misleading because it matches part of the reasoning steps but is about a different person.
idx: [7, 9, 6, 3]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 7: This context directly mentions Stéphane Lafleur and describes him as a French-Canadian, which is highly relevant to the claim and the reasoning steps. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim about the composer's country of origin. 2.

Context with index 5 mentions Brian Kennedy as an Irish-born museum director, which includes information about the birthplace of a director, although not the one in question, it's still somewhat relevant. 4. Context with index 4 mentions Olav Aaraas and his birthplace, which is again slightly relevant since it discusses the birthplace of a director. The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not mention Allan Kroeker or 'Age-Old Friends' or any birthplaces related to the claim.

Question:Who is the paternal grandmother of Princess Augusta Of Waldeck-Pyrmont?
golden idx: [8, 9]
step-by-step think: To find the paternal grandmother of Princess Augusta of Waldeck-Pyrmont, we need to identify her father and his mother. The reasoning steps provided are 'Princess Augusta of Waldeck-Pyrmont father George II', 'George II mother Princess Augusta of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen'. Therefore, we need to look for contexts that mention George II and his mother. 

1. Context idx 9 is the most relevant as it directly mentions George II, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, and identifies his mother as Princess Augusta of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.
2. Context idx 8 is relevant as it mentions Princess Augusta of Waldeck-Pyrmont and provides information about her family, which could lead to identifying her paternal grandmother.
3. Context idx 7 mentions George I, who is related to George II and could provide familial links to the paternal grandmother.
4. Context idx 3 mentions Caroline Louise of Waldeck and Pyrmont, who is part of the same lineage and could potentially provide information on the family tree.
5. Context idx 0 mentions Princess Mathilde of Waldeck and Pyrmont, who is part of the same house and could be connected to the family tree.
6. Context idx 6 mentions Princess Ida of Waldeck and Pyrmont, another member of the house who could be connected to the family tree.
7. Context idx 1 mentions Friedrich Anton Ulrich, a historical figure of Waldeck and Pyrmont, which might provide historical context to the family.
8. Context idx 4 mentions Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont, who is part of the lineage and could have connections to the family tree.

The remaining contexts are less likely to contain direct information about the paternal grandmother of Princess Augusta of Waldeck-Pyrmont based on the reasoning steps provided.

idx: [9, 8, 7, 3, 0, 6, 1, 4]

step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandmother of Princess Augusta of Waldeck-Pyrmont, we need to identify her father and then his mother. The reasoning steps provided are 'Princess Augusta of Waldeck-Pyrmont father George II', 'George II mother Princess Augusta of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen'. 1. Context 9 is the most relevant as it mentions George II and his mother, Princess Augusta of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, directly addressing the claim. 2. Context 8 is the second most relevant as it mentions Princess Augusta of Waldeck-Pyrmont and her father, George II, which is useful for establishing lineage. 3. Context 7 is relevant as it mentions George I, who is related to George II, but it does not mention George II's mother, making it less relevant than contexts 9 and 8. 4. Context 1 is the next most relevant as it provides information about the lineage of the ruling family of Waldeck and Pyrmont, which could indirectly help in identifying family relations.
idx: [9, 8, 7, 1]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 9: This context is highly relevant as it mentions George II, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, who is the father of Princess Augusta of Waldeck-Pyrmont, and it also mentions his mother, Princess Augusta of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, who is the paternal grandmother in question. 2. Context idx 8: This context is about Princess Augusta of Waldeck-Pyrmont herself, mentioning her as the daughter of George II, which is relevant but does not directly answer the claim about her paternal grandmother. 3. Context idx 7: This context mentions George I, who is the father of George II, making it relevant in establishing the lineage but not directly answering the claim about the paternal grandmother. 4. Context idx 1: This context is about Friedrich Anton Ulrich, who is not directly related to the claim, making it the least relevant context.

Question:Which film was released earlier, Tiger Of The Seven Seas or My Wife'S Lodger?
golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine which film was released earlier, we need to compare the publication dates provided in the reasoning steps. The context that directly mentions "My Wife's Lodger" with its publication date of 1952 is the most relevant and informative, thus scoring the highest. Next, the context mentioning "Tiger of the Seven Seas" with its publication date of 1962 is also highly relevant. The other contexts are ranked based on their titles' relevance to the films in question, with those mentioning similar themes or words like "wife" or "seven seas" being more relevant than those that do not.
idx: [1, 6, 0, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 1: "My Wife's Lodger" - This context directly matches one of the reasoning steps, stating the film's release year as 1952, which is relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 6: "Tiger of the Seven Seas" - This context also directly matches one of the reasoning steps, stating the film's release year as 1962, which is relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 0: "My Wife Is Being Stupid" - Although this context mentions a film released in 1952, it does not match the reasoning steps as closely as the contexts for "My Wife's Lodger" and "Tiger of the Seven Seas." 4. Context idx 4: "Leonora of the Seven Seas" - This context is about a film released in 1955, which is not directly relevant to the claim but is closer in time to the films in question than the other remaining contexts.
idx: [1, 6, 0, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "My Wife's Lodger" context: This context directly matches the reasoning step mentioning "My Wife's Lodger publication date 1952" and provides specific information about the film's release year, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. "Tiger of the Seven Seas" context: This context also directly matches the reasoning step mentioning "Tiger of the Seven Seas publication date 1962" and provides the exact release year of the film, making it highly relevant to the claim. 3. "My Wife Is Being Stupid" context: Although this context mentions a film released in 1952, it does not match the entities related to the claim as well as the first two contexts. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention the films in question. The context titled "Leonora of the Seven Seas" is not included in the top 3 as it does not match the reasoning steps as closely as the others and is less relevant to the claim.

Question:Do Alice Mary Dowd and Richard N. Palmer have the same nationality?
golden idx: [0, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the nationality of Alice Mary Dowd and Richard N. Palmer. The reasoning steps provided are 'Alice Mary Dowd country of citizenship American' and 'Richard N. Palmer country of citizenship United States'. Therefore, the contexts that mention their places of birth or citizenship will be most relevant.
1. Context 5 mentions Alice Mary Dowd and states she was an American educator and author, which matches the reasoning step for her.
2. Context 0 mentions Richard N. Palmer and states he was born in Hartford, Connecticut, which is in the United States, matching the reasoning step for him.
3. Context 1 mentions R. P. Blackmur, who is a different Richard Palmer and an American literary critic and poet, which is less relevant to the claim.
4. Context 2 mentions Richard Smart, who is also a different Richard Palmer and does not provide information on nationality.
5. Contexts 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not mention the individuals in question and are therefore not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the ranking is as follows:
idx: [5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Alice Mary Dowd and confirms her American citizenship, matching one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 0: This context is equally relevant as it directly mentions Richard N. Palmer and confirms his American citizenship, matching the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 6: This context mentions Alice Mary Dowse Weeks, who is also American, and while the name is similar to Alice Mary Dowd, it is not a direct match. However, it is still somewhat relevant due to the mention of American citizenship. 4. Context idx 1: This context mentions R. P. Blackmur, who shares the middle name 'Palmer' with Richard N. Palmer, and is also identified as American, making it slightly relevant. The other contexts are not relevant as they do not mention the individuals in question or their nationalities.
idx: [5,0,6,1]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Alice Mary Dowd and confirms her American citizenship, matching one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 0: This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions Richard N. Palmer and confirms his connection to Connecticut, United States, aligning with the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 6: This context mentions Alice Mary Weeks, who is also confirmed as American, but since the claim is about Alice Mary Dowd, this context is less relevant than the first two. However, it is more relevant than context idx 1, which does not mention either of the individuals in the claim.

Question:Who died later, Narcís Ventalló or H. Verlan Andersen?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine who died later between Narcís Ventalló and H. Verlan Andersen, I will rank the contexts based on the dates of death provided in the reasoning steps. Contexts that contain the exact dates of death or information about the individuals' deaths will be ranked higher. 1. "Narcís Ventalló" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact date of death for Narcís Ventalló, which is one of the entities in the reasoning steps. 2. "H. Verlan Andersen" context: This context is also highly relevant as it provides the exact date of death for H. Verlan Andersen, the other entity in the reasoning steps. The remaining contexts do not mention the individuals in question or their dates of death, so they will be ranked based on the closeness of their death dates to the dates mentioned in the reasoning steps. 3. "Rajesh Ghodge" context: This context mentions a death in 2019, which is closer to the dates in the reasoning steps compared to the other contexts. 4. "Hélène Grenier" context: This context mentions a death in 1992, which is the same year as H. Verlan Andersen's death but does not provide a closer month or day. 5. "Dick Stafford" context: This context mentions a death in 1912, which is not close to the dates in the reasoning steps but is the next closest by year. 6. "William Calow" context: This context mentions a death in 1487, which is further from the dates in the reasoning steps but still provides a specific year. 7. "John Roger (died 1441)" context: This context mentions a death in 1441, which is further from the dates in the reasoning steps but still provides a specific year. 8. "Sidonie of Bavaria" context: This context mentions a death in 1505, which is further from the dates in the reasoning steps but still provides a specific year. The remaining contexts are not as relevant because they either mention deaths that are too far in time from the reasoning steps or do not provide specific dates.
idx: [9, 0, 4, 2, 1, 7, 5, 3]

step-by-step think: The task is to determine who died later between Narcís Ventalló and H. Verlan Andersen. The reasoning steps provided are the dates of death for both individuals. 1. Context idx 9: This context is directly relevant as it provides the exact date of death for Narcís Ventalló, which is one of the entities in the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 0: This context is also directly relevant as it provides the exact date of death for H. Verlan Andersen, matching the other entity in the reasoning steps. 3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a date of death in January 2019, which is not relevant to the claim but is a date of death closer to the present than the other contexts, so it gets a lower ranking. 4. Context idx 2: This context mentions a date of death in 1992, which is the same year as H. Verlan Andersen's death, but since it does not pertain to the claim, it is ranked lower.
idx: [9, 0, 4, 2]

step-by-step think:1. Context with index 9 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Narcís Ventalló and provides the exact date of death, which is crucial to answer the claim. 2. Context with index 0 is the second most relevant because it provides the exact date of death for H. Verlan Andersen, which is necessary to compare with Narcís Ventalló's date of death. 3. Context with index 4 mentions Rajesh Ghodge and his date of death, which is not relevant to the claim. 4. Context with index 2 mentions Hélène Grenier and her date of death in 1992, which is not relevant to the claim about Narcís Ventalló and H. Verlan Andersen.

The reasoning steps provided are 'Aneta Hladíková date of birth 30 August 1984' and 'René Poupardin date of birth 27 February 1874'. Based on these dates, Aneta Hladíková is younger than René Poupardin. Now, to rank the contexts, we need to find which contexts mention these individuals and their dates of birth. Context 5 mentions Aneta Hladíková and her date of birth, making it highly relevant. Context 4 mentions René Poupardin and his date of birth, also making it highly relevant. The other contexts do not mention the dates of birth or the individuals in question, so they are less relevant. Therefore, the ranking will prioritize the contexts that mention the individuals and their dates of birth.

Question:What is the place of birth of the performer of song I Wish (Gabrielle Song)?
golden idx: [3, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well the context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 1. "Gabrielle (singer)" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions Gabrielle and provides information about her place of birth, Hackney, which is part of the claim. 2. "I Wish (Gabrielle song)" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the song "I Wish" by Gabrielle, which is directly related to the claim. 3. "Billy Milano" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different artist and does not mention Gabrielle or her place of birth. 4. "Astrid North" context: This context is about a different singer and does not provide information related to Gabrielle or her place of birth. 5. "Bernie Bonvoisin" context: This context is about another artist and is not relevant to the claim about Gabrielle. 6. "Kristian Leontiou" context: This context is about a different singer and does not mention Gabrielle or her place of birth. 7. "Caspar Babypants" context: This context is about a children's music artist and is not relevant to the claim about Gabrielle. 8.

idx: [3, 9, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 3 "Gabrielle (singer)" is the most relevant as it directly mentions Gabrielle's place of birth, which is Hackney, London, matching perfectly with the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 9 "I Wish (Gabrielle song)" is relevant because it discusses the song "I Wish" by Gabrielle, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not mention Gabrielle's place of birth. 3. Context idx 6 "Kristian Leontiou" mentions a British singer, which is somewhat relevant since Gabrielle is also a British singer, but it does not provide information about Gabrielle or her place of birth. 4. Context idx 7 "Caspar Babypants" is the least relevant among the top four because it mentions a singer and could potentially be confused with Gabrielle, but it does not provide any information related to the claim.
idx: [3, 9, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Gabrielle (singer)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Gabrielle and provides information about her place of birth, Hackney, which directly addresses the claim. It is informative and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "I Wish (Gabrielle song)" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the song "I Wish" by Gabrielle, which is part of the claim.

Context idx 6: This context directly mentions "Dis-moi qui tuer" with its publication date of 1965, which is crucial for the claim. 2. Context idx 1: This context provides the release information for "Under the Hawthorn Tree," stating it was released in 2010, which is also directly relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 7: While this context mentions "Under the Hawthorn Tree," it does not provide a specific publication date, but it is still relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 9: This context talks about "Under the Hawthorn Tree" as a novel, which is related but less directly relevant to the claim about the film. 5. Context idx 0: This context mentions a film with a similar title to "Dis-Moi Qui Tuer," but it was released in 1974, which might confuse the claim. 6. Context idx 5: This is a duplicate of context idx 0 and thus ranks equally. 7. Context idx 3: This context mentions "Dis-moi," which is similar to "Dis-Moi Qui Tuer," but it is a documentary from 1980, making it less relevant. 8. Context idx 4: This context is about a song that shares part of the title with "Dis-Moi Qui Tuer," but it is not relevant to the claim about films.

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 6: This context directly relates to the claim as it mentions "Dis-moi qui tuer" and provides the specific publication date of 1965, which is one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

It is equally relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 7: While this context mentions "Under the Hawthorn Tree," it does not provide a specific publication date or detailed information about the film, making it less relevant than the previous contexts. 4. Context idx 9: This context mentions "Under the Hawthorn Tree" but refers to the novel and its publication date in 1990, which is not directly related to the film's publication date but still provides some relevant background information.
idx: [6, 1, 7, 9]

step-by-step think:1. "Dis-moi qui tuer" context: This context directly relates to the claim as it mentions "Dis-moi qui tuer" and provides the specific publication date of 1965, which is one of the reasoning steps.

Question:What is the date of death of Henry St John, 18Th Baron St John Of Bletso's father?
golden idx: [0, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the date of death of Henry St John, 18th Baron St John of Bletso's father. The reasoning steps provided are clear: we're looking for information about Beauchamp St John, 17th Baron St John of Bletso, specifically his date of death. Context 5 directly mentions Beauchamp St John, 17th Baron St John of Bletso and his date of death, making it the most relevant and highest scoring context. Context 0 is the second most relevant as it mentions Henry St John, 18th Baron St John of Bletso, and the death of his father in 1912. The other contexts mention different Barons St John of Bletso and are less relevant to the claim. They should be ranked based on how closely they relate to the 17th and 18th Barons and the likelihood of containing information about the family that could indirectly answer the claim.
idx: [5, 0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 6]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 5: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions Beauchamp St John, 17th Baron St John of Bletso, and provides the exact date of death which is the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 0: This context is relevant because it mentions Henry St John, 18th Baron St John of Bletso, and his father Beauchamp St John, 17th Baron St John of Bletso, indicating the lineage and confirming the relationship between them. 3. Context idx 1: This context is less relevant as it mentions St Andrew St John, 15th Baron St John of Bletso, who is not directly related to the claim but is part of the family lineage. 4. Context idx 2: This context is also less relevant as it discusses John St John, 12th Baron St John of Bletso, who is further removed from the claim but still provides background on the family history.
idx: [5, 0, 1, 2]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the date of death of Henry St John, 18th Baron St John of Bletso's father. The reasoning steps provided include the name of the father, Beauchamp St John, 17th Baron St John of Bletso, and his date of death, 10 May 1912. Therefore, the context that directly mentions Beauchamp St John and his date of death will be ranked highest. 1. Context idx 5: This context is the most relevant as it mentions Beauchamp St John, 17th Baron St John of Bletso, and provides the exact date of death, which is the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 0: This context mentions Henry St John, 18th Baron St John of Bletso, and his relationship to Beauchamp St John, which is relevant but does not directly provide the date of death. 3.

Question:Who is younger, Justin Paul or Helly Shah?
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Justin Paul and Helly Shah, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are 'Justin Paul date of birth January 3, 1985', and 'Helly Shah date of birth 7 January 1996'. Therefore, the contexts that contain these specific dates will be most relevant.

1. Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Justin Paul's date of birth, which is directly related to the claim.
2. Context idx 2: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the date of birth for Helly Shah, which is necessary to answer the claim.
3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a Justin Paul Williams with a different date of birth, which could cause confusion but is still somewhat relevant due to the name match.
4. Context idx 7: This context mentions a Justin Paul Tucker with a date of birth, which is not directly relevant but shares the name Justin Paul.
5. Context idx 0: This context is about Justin Viele, not Justin Paul, but it is included because it contains a date of birth and the name Justin.
6. Context idx 9: This context is about a different Justin Paul, which is not directly relevant but shares the name.
7. Context idx 1: This context is about Miloš Zličić and mentions a younger brother, which is only tangentially related to the concept of age in the claim.
8. Context idx 5: This context is about Vadim Vlasov and mentions a younger brother, similar to idx 1, making it slightly relevant to the concept of age.

The remaining contexts (idx 6 and idx 8) are not included in the top 8 because they do not mention relevant dates of birth or are less directly related to the claim compared to the others.

idx: [3, 2, 4, 7, 0, 9, 1, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Justin Paul and Helly Shah, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are 'Justin Paul date of birth January 3, 1985', and 'Helly Shah date of birth 7 January 1996'. Based on these dates, Helly Shah is younger than Justin Paul. Now, let's rank the contexts:
1. Context idx 2: This context directly mentions Helly Shah and her date of birth, which is crucial for answering the claim.
2. Context idx 3: This context directly mentions Justin Paul and his date of birth, which is necessary to compare with Helly Shah's date of birth.
3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a different Justin Paul (Justin Williams), which could be confusing and is less relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 7: This context also mentions a different Justin Paul (Justin Tucker), which is not relevant to the claim.

The contexts mentioning other individuals named Justin Paul are ranked lower because they do not pertain to the Justin Paul in question and therefore do not help in determining who is younger between the two individuals specified in the claim.

idx: [2, 3, 4, 7]

step-by-step think: The task is to determine who is younger between Justin Paul and Helly Shah based on their dates of birth. 1. Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact date of birth for Justin Paul, which is directly related to the claim. 2. Context idx 2: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the exact date of birth for Helly Shah, which is necessary to answer the claim. 3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a different Justin Paul (Justin Williams), which could be confusing and is less relevant than the contexts that provide the correct information about the individuals in question. 4. Context idx 7: This context is the least relevant because it refers to another individual who shares the name but is not related to the claim.

Question:Who was born first out of Marco De Luigi and Fabio Maistro?
golden idx: [1, 4]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Marco De Luigi and Fabio Maistro, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are 'Marco de Luigi date of birth 21 March 1978' and 'Fabio Maistro date of birth 5 April 1998'. Therefore, we need to find contexts that mention these dates or provide information about these individuals' birth dates.

1. Context idx 4: This context mentions 'Marco de Luigi( born 21 March 1978)' which directly matches one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 1: This context mentions 'Fabio Maistro( born 5 April 1998)' which directly matches the other reasoning step. It is equally relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 9: This context mentions 'Fabio De Luigi', which could be confused with 'Fabio Maistro'. However, the date of birth is different, and it is less relevant than the contexts that match the reasoning steps exactly.
4. Context idx 5: This context mentions 'Guido De Luigi', sharing the surname with Marco De Luigi, but does not provide information about Marco's or Fabio's date of birth, making it less relevant.
5. Context idx 3: This context mentions 'Ludovico de Luigi', which is similar to 'Marco de Luigi', but again, it does not provide information about the birth dates in question.
6. Context idx 2: This context mentions 'Marco De Vito', which could be confused with 'Marco De Luigi'. However, it does not provide the needed birth date information.
7. Context idx 6: This context mentions 'Stefano De Luigi', sharing the surname but not providing relevant birth date information.
8. Context idx 0: This context mentions 'Giuseppe De Luigi', which is not directly relevant to the claim.

The remaining contexts (idx 7 and 8) do not mention the individuals in question and are therefore not relevant to the claim.

idx: [4, 1, 9, 5, 3, 2, 6, 0]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Marco De Luigi and Fabio Maistro, we need to compare their dates of birth. 1. The context for "Marco de Luigi" directly matches one of the reasoning steps, stating his date of birth as 21 March 1978, which is relevant and informative for the claim. 2. The context for "Fabio Maistro" also directly matches the other reasoning step, stating his date of birth as 5 April 1998, which is equally relevant and informative for the claim. 3. The context for "Fabio De Luigi" mentions a different individual with a similar name but is not relevant to the claim. 4. The context for "Guido De Luigi" is about another individual with a similar name and is not relevant to the claim. 5. The contexts for "Ludovico de Luigi," "Marco De Vito," "Stefano De Luigi," and "Giuseppe De Luigi" are all about different individuals and do not provide information relevant to the claim.
idx: [4, 1, 9, 5]

step-by-step think: 
1. "Marco de Luigi" context: It directly relates to the claim as it mentions "Marco de Luigi" and provides information about his date of birth. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. "Fabio Maistro" context: It directly relates to the claim as it mentions "Fabio Maistro" and provides information about his date of birth. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. "Fabio De Luigi" context: Although it does not directly relate to the claim, it provides information about a different person named "Fabio De Luigi". Therefore, it may not be as relevant or likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts directly related to the claim.

The most relevant context will be the one that mentions Edward's father and grandfather directly. 1. Context 0: This context is highly relevant as it mentions John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, who is Edward's father, and also mentions his own father, John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford, making it the most informative for the claim. 2.

Question:Which song was released earlier, 1990-Sick (Get 'Em All) or Who'S Laughing Now (Song)?
golden idx: [0, 1]
step-by-step think: To determine which song was released earlier, we need to compare the publication dates provided in the reasoning steps. The contexts that directly mention the songs and their release dates are most relevant. 1. "1990-Sick (Get 'Em All)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the song "1990-Sick (Get 'Em All)" and its release date in 1995, matching one of the reasoning steps. 2. "Who's Laughing Now (song)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions the song "Who's Laughing Now" and its release date in 2011, matching the other reasoning step. 3. "1990-Sick" context: This context discusses the album "1990-Sick" and provides additional details about the song "1990-Sick (Get 'Em All)", including its chart performance and the album's release date, which supports the information in the first context. 4. "Who's Laughing Now" context: Although this context mentions "Who's Laughing Now", it refers to a different album released in 1991 and does not provide information about the song in question. It is less relevant than the contexts that match the songs and dates exactly. The remaining contexts do not mention the songs or dates related to the claim and are therefore less relevant.
idx: [1, 0, 7, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. The claim is to determine which song was released earlier, "1990-Sick (Get 'Em All)" or "Who's Laughing Now (Song)". The reasoning steps provided are the publication dates of both songs, with "1990-Sick (Get 'Em All)" being published in 1995 and "Who's Laughing Now (Song)" in 2011.

1. Context idx 1: This context is about the song "1990-Sick (Get 'Em All)" and mentions its release date as 1995, which directly matches one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 0: This context is about the song "Who's Laughing Now" and mentions its release date as 2011, which directly matches the other reasoning step. It is also highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 7: This context provides additional information about the album "1990-Sick" and its release date, which supports the information given in context idx 1. It is relevant but slightly less direct than the specific song context.
4. Context idx 2: This context is about an album titled "Who's Laughing Now" but from 1991 and by a different artist, L.A.P.D. It is less relevant because it does not pertain to the song by Jessie J, but it is included because it shares part of the title.

The remaining contexts are about different songs or albums that do not match the reasoning steps and are not relevant to the claim.

idx: [1, 0, 7, 2]

step-by-step think: The task is to determine which song was released earlier, "1990-Sick (Get 'Em All)" or "Who's Laughing Now (Song)". According to the reasoning steps, "1990-Sick (Get 'Em All)" was published in 1995 and "Who's Laughing Now (song)" was published in 2011. Therefore, the contexts need to be ranked based on how well they match these publication dates and the relevance to the claim.

1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "1990-Sick (Get 'Em All)" and confirms its publication date as 1995, matching the reasoning step. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.

2. Context idx 0: This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions "Who's Laughing Now (song)" and confirms its publication date as 2011, matching the reasoning step. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.

4. Context idx 2: This context is less relevant as it refers to a different "Who's Laughing Now" album released by L.A.P.D. in 1991, which does not pertain to the claim about the song by Jessie J.

Based on the rules, the top 3 contexts that are most relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim are contexts with idx 1, 0, and 7.

Question:Who is Prince Franz De Paula Of Liechtenstein's paternal grandfather?
golden idx: [6, 8]
step-by-step think: To find Prince Franz De Paula Of Liechtenstein's paternal grandfather, we need to identify his father and then his grandfather. 1. Context idx 6 is the most relevant as it mentions Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein being the son of Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein. 2. Context idx 8 is the second most relevant as it mentions Johann I Joseph and his father Franz Joseph I, directly linking to the reasoning steps. 3. Context idx 5 mentions Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein, who is the grandfather in question. 4. Context idx 0 mentions Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein but does not provide information about his father or grandfather. 5. Context idx 2 mentions Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein and his family relations but not the specific lineage needed. 6. Context idx 3 mentions a Prince of Liechtenstein but from an earlier generation that does not match the reasoning steps. 7. Context idx 9 mentions Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein, who is related but not directly relevant to the claim. 8. Context idx 1 mentions a Prince Franz Josef of Liechtenstein but from a much later period and not relevant to the claim.
idx: [6, 8, 5, 0, 2, 3, 9, 1]

step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandfather of Prince Franz De Paula of Liechtenstein, we need to trace his lineage through his father and grandfather. The reasoning steps provided indicate that his father is Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein, and his paternal grandfather is Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein. Therefore, the contexts that mention these individuals and their relationships are most relevant.

1. Context idx 8: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein, who is the father of Prince Franz De Paula of Liechtenstein. It also states that Johann I Joseph was the son of Franz Joseph I, making him the paternal grandfather of Prince Franz De Paula. This context directly answers the claim.

2. Context idx 5: This context is about Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein, who is the paternal grandfather in question. It provides information about his reign and life, which is directly relevant to the claim.

3. Context idx 6: This context mentions Prince Franz De Paula of Liechtenstein and his father, Johann I Joseph, which is relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention Franz Joseph I, so it is slightly less relevant than the previous contexts.

4. Context idx 2: This context talks about Prince Alfred of Liechtenstein, who is the son of Prince Franz De Paula of Liechtenstein. It is relevant as it pertains to the family but does not directly address the paternal grandfather.

The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the direct lineage or provide information about the paternal grandfather of Prince Franz De Paula of Liechtenstein.
idx: [8, 5, 6, 2]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions Franz Joseph I, who is identified as the paternal grandfather of Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein in the reasoning steps. It provides direct information about Franz Joseph I's role as Prince of Liechtenstein, which is crucial for establishing the lineage. 2. Context idx 8: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Johann I Joseph, who is the father of Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein. It confirms Johann I Joseph's relationship to Franz Joseph I, providing a clear link in the family tree. 3. Context idx 6: This context mentions Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein and his relation to Johann I Joseph, which is useful but less direct compared to the contexts that mention the paternal grandfather by name. It provides additional family details which support the lineage but are not as directly related to the claim as the first two contexts.

Context 3: This context mentions Mohamad Afa Al Rifai, who is playing in Jordan, indicating a possible connection to the Rifai family. 5. Context 6: This context mentions Khaled El-Ali El-Rifai, a Syrian wrestler, but since he competed in the Olympics and is associated with Jordan, it could be relevant. 6.

"Deva (composer)" context: This context is directly related to the claim and reasoning steps, mentioning Deva and his work in the Tamil film industry, which suggests his place of birth could be in Tamil Nadu. 2. "Love Story 1999" context: This context is about the film for which Deva composed music, making it relevant to the claim. 3.

It is less likely to contain the answer compared to contexts that mention Deva or the film. 4. Context idx 1 "Bert Grund": Similar to idx 0, this context discusses a German composer and does not provide information about Deva or his place of birth, making it less relevant to the claim.

step-by-step think: To determine the father of Beltrán Vélez De Guevara, Marquis Of Campo Real, we need to identify the contexts that mention his family relationships. The reasoning steps indicate that Beltrán Vélez de Guevara is a sibling of Íñigo Vélez de Guevara, 8th Count of Oñate, and their father is Íñigo Vélez de Guevara, 7th Count of Oñate. Therefore, we should prioritize contexts that mention these individuals and their relationships.

step-by-step think: To determine the father of Beltrán Vélez De Guevara, Marquis Of Campo Real, we need to consider the reasoning steps provided. The first reasoning step indicates that Beltrán Vélez de Guevara, Marquis of Campo Real, is a sibling of Íñigo Vélez de Guevara, 8th Count of Oñate. The second reasoning step tells us that Íñigo Vélez de Guevara, 8th Count of Oñate's father is Íñigo Vélez de Guevara, 7th Count of Oñate. Therefore, we are looking for a context that mentions these relationships. 

1. Context idx 9: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Beltrán Vélez de Guevara and identifies his parents as Iñigo Vélez de Guevara and Catalina de Guevara, 5th Countess of Oñate. It directly answers the claim by stating his father's name.
2. Context idx 5: This context is relevant as it mentions Íñigo Vélez de Guevara, 8th Count of Oñate, and his relationship with Beltrán Vélez de Guevara, indicating that they are brothers. It also mentions their father, making it pertinent to the claim.
3. Context idx 2: This context is relevant because it provides information about Íñigo Vélez de Guevara, 7th Count of Oñate, who is the father of the 8th Count of Oñate and therefore the grandfather of Beltrán Vélez de Guevara, making it indirectly relevant to the claim.

The context idx 6 is less relevant because it does not mention the individuals directly related to the claim. Therefore, it is not included in the top 3 contexts.

Question:What is the place of birth of Empress Xu (Ming Dynasty)'s husband?
golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about Empress Xu's husband's place of birth and the presence of entities and relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps. 1. "Yongle Emperor" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Yongle Emperor, who is Empress Xu's spouse, and discusses his place of birth, Nanjing, which directly answers the claim. 2. "Empress Xu (Ming dynasty)" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about Empress Xu and her connection to the Yongle Emperor, although it does not mention his place of birth. 3. The remaining contexts do not mention the Yongle Emperor or his place of birth and are therefore not relevant to the claim.
idx: [6,1]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the birthplace of Empress Xu's husband, the Yongle Emperor. The reasoning steps guide us to look for contexts mentioning Empress Xu and the Yongle Emperor, specifically his place of birth, Nanjing. 1. "Empress Xu (Ming dynasty)" context: This context is directly related to Empress Xu and mentions her as the empress consort to the Yongle Emperor. It is highly relevant and likely contains information about her husband. 2. "Yongle Emperor" context: This context is entirely about the Yongle Emperor, providing extensive information about his life, including details that could lead to his place of birth. 3. "Stan Rice" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different person and does not mention the Yongle Emperor or Nanjing. 4. "Jonathan Xu" context: This context is about a different individual with the surname Xu and is not relevant to the claim. 5. "Jeffrey Xu" context: Similar to the previous, this context is about a different person named Xu and does not relate to the claim. 6. "Xu Qi" context: This context is about a pianist named Xu and does not provide information relevant to the claim. 7. "Zhang Xu (footballer)" context: This context is about a footballer named Xu and is not relevant to the claim. 8. "Yang Xu" context: This context is about another individual named Xu and does not mention the Yongle Emperor or Nanjing. 9. "Chenyang Xu" context: This context is about a mathematician named Xu and does not relate to the claim. 10. "Jon Leach" context: This context is about Jon Leach and is not relevant to the claim.
idx: [1, 6]

step-by-step think: To address the claim about the place of birth of Empress Xu's husband, the Yongle Emperor, we need to find contexts that mention both Empress Xu and the Yongle Emperor, particularly focusing on his place of birth. 1. "Empress Xu (Ming dynasty)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Empress Xu and her connection to the Yongle Emperor. It is likely to contain information about her husband. 2. "Yongle Emperor" context: This context is directly about the Yongle Emperor, Empress Xu's husband, and is likely to contain detailed information about his life, including his place of birth. 3. The remaining contexts do not seem to be directly related to the claim or the reasoning steps provided. They mention individuals with the surname Xu or are related to other historical figures, but they do not pertain to Empress Xu or the Yongle Emperor.

Question:Which film came out earlier, Niyoti or Angali Pangali?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine which film came out earlier, Niyoti or Angali Pangali, we need to compare their release dates. The reasoning steps provided are 'Niyoti publication date 2016' and 'Angali Pangali publication date 17 June 2016'. 

1. Context idx 3 ("Angali Pangali"): This context is directly relevant as it mentions the film "Angali Pangali" and provides the exact release date, 17 June 2016, which matches one of the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 6 ("Niyoti"): This context is also directly relevant as it mentions the film "Niyoti" and states that it was released in India on 10 June 2016, which is earlier than the release date of "Angali Pangali".
3. The remaining contexts do not pertain to the films in question and therefore are not relevant to the claim.

Based on the information provided, "Niyoti" came out earlier than "Angali Pangali".

idx: [6, 3]

step-by-step think: To determine which film came out earlier, we need to compare the release dates of 'Niyoti' and 'Angali Pangali'. The reasoning steps provided are 'Niyoti publication date 2016' and 'Angali Pangali publication date 17 June 2016'. 

1. Context 3 ('Angali Pangali'): This context is directly relevant as it provides the exact release date of 'Angali Pangali', which is 17 June 2016. It matches one of the reasoning steps perfectly.
2. Context 6 ('Niyoti'): This context is also directly relevant as it provides the release date of 'Niyoti' in India, which is 10 June 2016. It matches the other reasoning step and is crucial for answering the claim.
3. Context 7 ('Life Is What You Make It (film)'): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film released in 2017.
4. Context 5 ('Kabani Nadi Chuvannappol'): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a film released in 1975.
5. Context 4 ('The Night of Nights'): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a film released in 1939.
6. Context 2 ('Operation Leopard'): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a film released in 1980.

10. Context 9 ('When the Mountains Tremble'): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a film released in 1983.

The top two contexts are clear as they directly answer the claim. The remaining contexts do not provide information relevant to the claim, but they are ranked based on their proximity to the release dates mentioned in the reasoning steps.
idx: [3, 6, 7, 5, 4, 2, 1, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "Niyoti" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the exact publication date of the film "Niyoti," which is 10 June 2016. It directly addresses one of the reasoning steps and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Angali Pangali" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the specific release date of "Angali Pangali," which is 17 June 2016. It matches the other reasoning step and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Life Is What You Make It (film)" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different film released in 2017, which does not help in determining which of the two films in question came out earlier. 4.

It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Roberto Savio" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses Roberto Savio and his dual nationality, which is not directly related to the claim or the reasoning steps. However, it does mention nationality, which is a key aspect of the claim. 4. "Nayelly Hernández" context: This context mentions nationality and international representation, which are somewhat related to the claim but less directly than the top two contexts. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts.
idx: [5, 4, 3, 8]

"Toolbox Murders" context: This context is also directly related to the claim and provides the publication date of the film. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. 3. "Coffin Baby" context: This context is related to the "Toolbox Murders" and discusses a sequel, which is relevant to the claim but less direct than the context that provides the publication date of "Toolbox Murders." 4. "The Toolbox Murders" context: This context provides information about the original 1978 film, which is less relevant to the claim than the 2004 remake but still related to the "Toolbox Murders" series. 5. "Passione (2010 film)" context: This context mentions Naples, which is related to "I Met You in Naples," but it is about a different film and thus less relevant. 6. "The Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio" context: This context is about a film released in 2009, which is not directly related to the claim but is more recent than the other unrelated films mentioned. 7. "Since I Met You Baby (album)" context: This context is about an album and not a film, making it less relevant to the claim. 8. "Ninagoskara" context: This context is about a film released in 2002, which is not related to the claim.
idx: [3,5,9,6,7,1,4,0]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. The claim is about the release dates of two films, "Toolbox Murders" and "I Met You In Naples." The reasoning steps provided are the publication dates of both films, with "Toolbox Murders" in 2004 and "I Met You in Naples" in 1946.

1. Context idx 5 ("Toolbox Murders"): This context is directly relevant as it provides the exact publication date mentioned in the reasoning steps. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 3 ("I Met You in Naples"): This context is also directly relevant, providing the publication date that matches the reasoning steps. It is equally likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 9 ("Coffin Baby"): This context is related to "Toolbox Murders" as it discusses a film represented as a sequel. It mentions the 2004 film and could be informative regarding the claim.
4. Context idx 6 ("The Toolbox Murders"): Although this context talks about the original 1978 film, it is related to the "Toolbox Murders" remake and could provide background information useful for the claim.

The other contexts are less relevant as they do not directly address the films in question or their publication dates.

idx: [5, 3, 9, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine which film was released more recently, we need to compare the publication dates provided in the reasoning steps. The reasoning steps indicate that 'Toolbox Murders' was released in 2004 and 'I Met You in Naples' was released in 1946. Therefore, we should rank the contexts based on how well they match these publication dates and their relevance to the claim.
1. Context idx 5: This context is about 'Toolbox Murders' and confirms its publication date as 2004, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 3: This context is about 'I Met You in Naples' and confirms its publication date as 1946, which matches the other reasoning step. It is also highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 9: This context mentions 'Coffin Baby' as a film related to 'Toolbox Murders', but it does not provide a publication date for 'Toolbox Murders'. It is less relevant than the first two contexts but still provides information related to one of the films in question.
The context about 'The Toolbox Murders' from 1978 (idx 6) is not relevant to the claim since it does not match the publication dates we are comparing for the two films in question.

Context 8: This context is relevant because it mentions the song "How Long Has This Been Going On?" composed by George Gershwin. However, it does not mention his place of death. 3. Context 6: This context is less relevant as it only mentions the song and does not provide information about George Gershwin's life or death. 4.

Question:What is the place of birth of the performer of song Hunter (Björk Song)?
golden idx: [6, 8]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about the place of birth of the performer of the song "Hunter" by Björk, we need to find contexts that mention Björk and her place of birth. Context 6 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Björk and her place of birth, Reykjavík. Context 8 is also relevant as it discusses the song "Hunter" by Björk, but it does not mention her place of birth. The other contexts are about different individuals with the name "Hunter" or similar and are not relevant to the claim. Therefore, they are ranked lower.
idx: [6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim about Björk's place of birth. 1. Context idx 6 titled 'Björk' is the most relevant as it directly mentions Björk's place of birth as Reykjavík, which matches perfectly with the reasoning steps. 2.

Among them, context idx 5 titled 'Bernie Bonvoisin' is slightly more relevant than the others as it mentions a musician and their work, which could be tangentially related to the claim about another musician. 4. Context idx 0 titled 'Les Hunter (footballer)' is the next most relevant, as the title includes the word 'Hunter', but it is about a different person entirely. The rest of the contexts are about individuals unrelated to the claim and do not provide information on Björk or her song 'Hunter'.

It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. Context idx 0 "Les Hunter (footballer)": This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about a footballer named Les Hunter and does not mention Björk or her place of birth. It is the least likely to contain the answer to the claim.

3. Context 6 ("Cornelia (mother of the Gracchi)") is less relevant because it does not mention the entities related to the claim.
4. Context 4 ("Maria Thins") mentions the term 'mother-in-law' but is about a different person and time period, making it less relevant.
5. The remaining contexts (1, 2, 3, 7) are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the entities related to Lollia Paulina, Caligula, or Agrippina the Elder.
idx: [0, 5, 6, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Caligula" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Caligula, who is the spouse of Lollia Paulina, and Agrippina the Elder, who is Caligula's mother and thus Lollia Paulina's mother-in-law. It provides detailed information about Caligula's family and lineage, which is directly related to the claim. 2. "Lollia Paulina" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Lollia Paulina directly and her role as a Roman Empress, which is related to the claim. However, it does not mention her relationship with Agrippina the Elder. 3. "Cornelia (mother of the Gracchi)" context: This context is less relevant as it does not mention Lollia Paulina or her relationships. It is informative about Cornelia but unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Maria Thins" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses Maria Thins, who has no connection to Lollia Paulina or the entities mentioned in the reasoning steps.

4. Context idx 3 ("Thor the Conqueror"): This context is less directly related but mentions a title similar to "Kull the Conqueror," which might lead to confusion, so it has some relevance.
5. Context idx 2 ("The Conqueror (novel)"): This context is about a novel with a similar name but is not directly related to the films in question.
6. Context idx 1 ("Invasion of the Neptune Men"): This context mentions a film and its release dates, which shows a format that could be informative for the claim but is about a different film.

8. Context idx 5 ("The Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio"): This context mentions a film release date, which is relevant to the structure of the claim but is about a different film.
The remaining contexts are not directly related to the films in question and therefore are not ranked within the top 8.

Context idx 9: Similar to idx 3, this context refers to a different Gevherhan Sultan, the daughter of Ahmed I, and is therefore less relevant to the claim. The remaining contexts are unrelated to the claim as they do not mention Selim II or the Ottoman Empire.

step-by-step think:1. Context with idx 8 titled 'Selim II' is the most relevant as it directly mentions Selim II and provides extensive information about his reign and life, which is directly related to the claim about Gevherhan Sultan's father's nationality. 2. Context with idx 4 titled 'Gevherhan Sultan (daughter of Selim II)' is the second most relevant as it confirms the relationship between Gevherhan Sultan and Selim II, and provides additional context about her family. 3. Contexts with idx 3 and 9 are less relevant as they pertain to different individuals named Gevherhan Sultan who are daughters of different Sultans, not Selim II. However, context with idx 3 is slightly more relevant than idx 9 because it mentions the Ottoman Empire, which is related to the claim.

idx: [2, 7, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim is about whether both Țerova and Slava (River) are located in the same country. The reasoning steps provided are 'Țerova country Romania' and 'Slava (river) country Romania', which indicate that the answer to the claim lies in establishing the country of location for both entities. 
1. Context idx 2 ("Țerova"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Țerova is a tributary in Romania, directly matching one of the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 7 ("Slava (river)"): This context is equally relevant because it confirms that the Slava is a river in Romania, aligning perfectly with the other reasoning step.

2. Context idx 5: This context is about the Fruita Schoolhouse and states that it is located in the United States. It matches the other reasoning step perfectly and is also highly relevant to the claim.
3. Context idx 0: This context mentions Fruita, which is related to the Fruita Schoolhouse. It does not directly state the country, but by association, it is relevant and could help infer the location of the schoolhouse.
4. Context idx 6: This context talks about the Colorado River State Park, which is near Fruita, and by extension, it is related to the Fruita Schoolhouse. It is less directly related than context idx 0 but still relevant.

The other contexts are less relevant as they do not directly mention the entities related to the claim or the reasoning steps.

Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the Graduate University of Advanced Technology and provides detailed information about its location in Iran, which matches one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 5: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions the Fruita Schoolhouse and its location in the United States, aligning with the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 0: While this context does not directly mention the Fruita Schoolhouse, it discusses Redlands, Colorado, which is in close proximity to Fruita, Utah, and could provide additional geographical context. However, it is less directly related to the claim than the first two contexts. 4. Context idx 6: This context talks about the James M. Robb – Colorado River State Park, which includes the Fruita segment. It is informative regarding the location but is the least directly related to the claim compared to the other contexts.

Question:Who is George Fitzroy, 1St Duke Of Northumberland's stepmother?
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: To determine the stepmother of George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, we need to consider his father Charles II's spouse, as the stepmother would be the wife of the biological father. The context must mention Charles II and his spouse to be relevant. 

1. Context 0: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Charles II and his marriage to Catherine of Braganza, who would be the stepmother if she had survived until the birth of George FitzRoy. However, it does not mention George FitzRoy directly.
2. Context 2: This context is directly about George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and mentions his father, Charles II, but does not mention Charles II's spouse, which is crucial for identifying the stepmother.
3. Context 6: This context mentions Charles Lennox, another illegitimate son of Charles II, which could be indirectly relevant, but it does not mention George FitzRoy or Charles II's spouse.
4. Context 8: This context mentions James FitzJames, another illegitimate son of King James II, which is less relevant as it does not pertain to Charles II or his spouse.
5. Context 7: This context mentions Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, but does not relate to Charles II or his spouse, making it less relevant.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the contexts are ranked as follows:
idx: [0, 2, 6, 8, 7, 3, 1, 4]

step-by-step think: The claim is about identifying the stepmother of George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland. The reasoning steps guide us to consider George FitzRoy's father, Charles II, and his spouse, Catherine of Braganza. Therefore, contexts that mention Charles II, Catherine of Braganza, and their relationship to George FitzRoy are most relevant.
1. Context 0 ("Charles II of England"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Charles II and his marriage to Catherine of Braganza, who would be George FitzRoy's stepmother if Charles II had any other wives. However, it states that Catherine bore no live children, implying she is not the stepmother of George FitzRoy.
2. Context 2 ("George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland"): This context is directly about George FitzRoy and mentions his parents, Charles II and Barbara Villiers. It is highly relevant but does not mention a stepmother, so it may not contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context 6 ("Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond"): This context mentions another illegitimate son of Charles II but does not mention George FitzRoy or his stepmother.
4. Context 8 ("James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick"): Similar to context 6, this context mentions an illegitimate son of a different English king and does not provide information about George FitzRoy's stepmother.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the reasoning steps, the contexts should be ranked as follows:
idx: [0, 2, 6, 8]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the stepmother of George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, which implies we need to find information about his father's spouse. The reasoning steps guide us to look for Charles II's spouse, Catherine of Braganza. Therefore, we need to rank the contexts based on how well they match these entities and relationships.
1. Context idx 0: This context is about Charles II of England and mentions his spouse, Catherine of Braganza, which is directly relevant to the claim. It is highly likely to contain the answer because it discusses Charles II's family and relationships.
2. Context idx 2: This context is about George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and mentions his father, Charles II, and his mother, Barbara Villiers. It is relevant but does not mention Charles II's spouse, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim about the stepmother.

The reasoning steps provided are 'Elsah, Illinois country U.S.' and 'Chah-e Puzeh, Tabas country Iran', which clearly indicate that they are in different countries. Therefore, the contexts that directly mention either Elsah, Illinois or Chah-e Puzeh, Tabas and their respective countries will be most relevant.

step-by-step think: The claim is about the nationality of Anne of Burgundy's father. The reasoning steps provided are 'Anne of Burgundy father John the Fearless' and 'John the Fearless country of citizenship France'. Therefore, the contexts that mention 'John the Fearless' and his association with France will be ranked higher. 

1. Context 1 ('John the Fearless') directly mentions John the Fearless and his role in French affairs, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 3 ('Anne of Burgundy') mentions Anne of Burgundy and identifies John the Fearless as her father, which is directly relevant to the claim.
3. Context 9 ('Joan III, Countess of Burgundy') talks about Joan of France, which is related to the French nobility and could provide contextual information about the claim.
4. Context 0 ('Florine of Burgundy') mentions the French nobility and provides background on the Burgundy lineage, which is somewhat relevant.
5. Context 8 ('Sibylla of Burgundy, Duchess of Burgundy') also mentions the French nobility and the Burgundy lineage, providing context that is somewhat relevant.
6. Context 7 ('Isabella of Bourbon') is related to the Burgundy lineage and French nobility, making it somewhat relevant.
7. Context 4 ('Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy') is about the Duke of Burgundy and provides historical context, but is less directly related to the claim.
8. Context 6 ('Agnes of France, Duchess of Burgundy') mentions the French nobility and could provide background information, but is less directly related to the claim.

The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not mention John the Fearless or the French nobility directly related to the claim.

These two contexts are the most relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "The Pirates of Somalia (film)" context: This context is about a film with a similar name but is not directly related to the claim. However, it provides a release date, which is relevant to the task of comparing film release dates. 4. "The Prairie (film)" context: This context is about a film with a name similar to one of the films in the claim but does not provide a release date, making it less relevant. 5. "Pirates of the Sky" context: This context is about a different film with a similar name and provides conflicting release dates, which could be informative but is less directly related to the claim. 6. "Pirates of Malaya" context: This context is about a different film with a similar name and provides historical context, which is informative but not directly relevant to the claim. 7. "Pirates of Treasure Island" context: This context is about a different film with a similar name and discusses its relation to another film series, which is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 8. "Pirates of the Coast" context: This context is about a different film with a similar name and provides some historical context, which is informative but not directly relevant to the claim.
idx: [1, 4, 2, 8, 0, 6, 7, 9]

step-by-step think:1. "Alien Origin" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Alien Origin" and provides the specific publication date of 2012, which is essential for addressing the claim. 2. "Pirates of the Prairie" context: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions "Pirates of the Prairie" and provides the specific publication date of 1942, which is necessary to compare with "Alien Origin." 3. "The Pirates of Somalia (film)" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions a different film, "The Pirates of Somalia," which was released in 2017. However, it is still informative and related to the film industry. 4. "The Prairie (film)" context: This context is relevant to the extent that it mentions a film titled "The Prairie" from 1947, but it is less directly related to the claim than the contexts for "Alien Origin" and "Pirates of the Prairie."
idx: [4,1,2,8]

step-by-step think:1. "Alien Origin" context: This context directly relates to the claim as it mentions "Alien Origin" and provides the specific publication date, which is essential to answer the claim. It is highly relevant and informative. 2. "Pirates of the Prairie" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions "Pirates of the Prairie" and provides its publication date. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "The Pirates of Somalia (film)" context: Although this context mentions a film with a similar name, it is not directly related to the claim. However, it provides a publication date for a different film, which might cause confusion but is less relevant than the contexts that directly address the films in question. 4. "The Prairie (film)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not match either of the films mentioned in the claim or the reasoning steps.

Question:Who is the mother of Edward I Of England?
golden idx: [4, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine the mother of Edward I of England, we need to identify contexts that mention his father, Henry III, and his spouse. Context 4 titled "Henry III of England" directly mentions Henry III and his spouse Eleanor of Provence, making it highly relevant. Context 9 titled "Edward I of England" provides extensive information about Edward I, including his parents and lineage, which is crucial for answering the claim. Context 6 titled "Henry, son of Edward I" mentions Edward I and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, which is informative but less directly related to Edward I's mother. Context 1 titled "Edward Despenser (died 1342)" mentions Edward I as a great-grandfather, providing some familial context. The remaining contexts do not mention the relevant entities or relationships and are therefore ranked lower.
idx: [4, 9, 6, 1, 0, 2, 3, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine the ranking of the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 1. Context idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Henry III and his spouse Eleanor of Provence, directly addressing the reasoning steps and providing information about their marriage and children. 2. Context idx 9: This context is about Edward I of England, the son of Henry III, and provides background on his life and reign. It is relevant and may contain information about his mother. 3. Context idx 6: This context mentions Henry, son of Edward I, and his mother Eleanor of Castile, which is closely related to the claim but does not directly answer the question about Edward I's mother. 4. Context idx 1: This context is about Edward Despenser, a great-grandson of Edward I, which makes it less directly relevant than the previous contexts but still related to the family lineage.
idx: [4, 9, 6, 1]

step-by-step think: To determine the ranking of the contexts, I will evaluate how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.
1. Context idx 4 ("Henry III of England"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Henry III and his spouse Eleanor of Provence, directly matching the entities in the reasoning steps. It provides detailed information about Henry III's life, including his marriage to Eleanor of Provence, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 9 ("Edward I of England"): This context is relevant as it discusses Edward I, the subject of the claim. It provides information about his life and reign, and since he is the son of Henry III, it is likely to mention his mother as well, thus potentially containing the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 6 ("Henry, son of Edward I"): This context is less directly related to the claim but still relevant as it mentions Edward I and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile. Since it discusses Edward I's children, there is a possibility that it may contain information about his mother.
4. Context idx 1 ("Edward Despenser (died 1342)"): This context is the least relevant as it focuses on a descendant of Edward I, which is not directly related to the claim about Edward I's mother.

Question:Which album came out first, Issa Album or 3.2.1.?
golden idx: [3, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine which album came out first, we need to compare the publication dates provided in the reasoning steps. The reasoning steps indicate that 'Issa Album' was published on July 7, 2017, and '3.2.1.' was published in 1998. Therefore, we can conclude that '3.2.1.' came out before 'Issa Album'. Now, let's rank the contexts based on how well they match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, their relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 7 ('3.2.1.'): This context is directly about the album '3.2.1.' and provides the exact publication date, which is crucial for answering the claim.
2. Context idx 3 ('Issa Album'): This context is directly about 'Issa Album' and provides the exact publication date, which is necessary to answer the claim.
3. Context idx 1 ('A Town South of Bakersfield'): This context mentions various publication dates, which shows a pattern of album releases and could help understand the timeline of album releases, although it's less directly related to the claim.
4. Context idx 4 ('Dat Whoopty Woop'): This context provides a publication date for another album, which could be useful for understanding the common era of album releases.
5. Context idx 0 ('Join the Triumph'): This context also provides a publication date for an album, which adds to the understanding of album release timelines.
6. Context idx 5 ('Living Very Happily'): This context mentions the release of an album's second edition, which indicates the process of album releases.
7. Context idx 9 ('Marching for Liberty'): This context provides a release date for an album, contributing to the overall understanding of album release periods.
8. Context idx 8 ('Mulberry Violence'): This context provides a release date for an album, which is less directly related to the claim but still relevant to the concept of album release dates.

The remaining contexts do not provide specific information about the albums in question or relevant publication dates and are therefore not included in the top 8 ranked contexts.

idx: [7, 3, 1, 4, 0, 5, 9, 8]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 7 ("3.2.1."): This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the album "3.2.1." and provides the exact publication date, which is crucial for answering the claim. 2. Context idx 3 ("Issa Album"): This context is the second most relevant because it directly mentions "Issa Album" and provides the exact publication date, which is necessary to determine which album came out first. 3. Context idx 1 ("A Town South of Bakersfield"): This context is less relevant because it does not pertain to either of the albums in question, but it discusses album release dates, which is related to the topic of the claim. 4. Context idx 4 ("Dat Whoopty Woop"): This context is included because it mentions an album release date, but it is not directly related to the claim.
idx: [7, 3, 1, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with idx 7 ("3.2.1."): This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the album "3.2.1." and provides the exact publication date, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is highly informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context with idx 3 ("Issa Album"): This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions "Issa Album" and provides the exact publication date, matching the other reasoning step. It is equally informative and contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context with idx 1 ("A Town South of Bakersfield"): Although this context is about a different album, it mentions publication dates of albums in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which could be useful for establishing a timeline. However, it is less directly related to the claim compared to the first two contexts. 4. Context with idx 4 ("Dat Whoopty Woop"): This context is the least relevant as it does not match the reasoning steps and is about a different album with a publication date that is not pertinent to the claim.
idx: [7, 3, 1]

Question:Which film was released earlier, New Jersey Drive or It Happened At The World'S Fair?
golden idx: [4, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim requires determining which film, "New Jersey Drive" or "It Happened at the World's Fair," was released earlier. The reasoning steps provided are 'New Jersey Drive publication date 1995' and "It Happened at the World's Fair publication date 1963". Therefore, contexts that mention these films and their release dates are most relevant.

1. Context idx 5 ("It Happened at the World's Fair") directly addresses the claim by mentioning the film and its release year, 1963, which is crucial for answering the question.
2. Context idx 4 ("New Jersey Drive") is also directly relevant as it mentions the film and its release year, 1995.
3. Context idx 0 ("New Jersey Drive, Vol. 1") is related to the "New Jersey Drive" film but talks about the soundtrack, not the film's release. It is still relevant due to the connection with the film.
4. Context idx 2 ("The Middleton Family at the New York World's Fair") is less relevant as it mentions a different World's Fair and is an unrelated film.
5. Context idx 3 ("It Happened at the Police Station") and idx 7 ("It Happened at the Police Station (1963 film)") are not relevant to the claim as they discuss a different film.
6. Context idx 1 ("2000 Michigan 500") is not relevant as it does not pertain to either film mentioned in the claim.
7. Context idx 6 ("Drive") and idx 8 ("It") are not relevant as they do not provide information about the films in question.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the contexts are ranked as follows:

Context idx 0: This context is about the soundtrack of "New Jersey Drive" and mentions its release date in 1995, which is indirectly relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 2: This context is about a different World's Fair and is less directly relevant to the claim, but it is still more relevant than the other remaining contexts.
idx: [5, 4, 0, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "It Happened at the World's Fair" context: This context directly matches the reasoning step mentioning the film's publication date in 1963, which is relevant to the claim. It provides specific information about the film and its release year, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

The reasoning steps provided are 'Arnold Palmer Regional Airport country US' and 'Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport country United States', which indicate that both airports are located in the United States. Therefore, contexts that mention either of these airports and their locations will be most relevant.

1. Context idx 4: This context is about Arnold Palmer Regional Airport and mentions it is in Pennsylvania, United States, which directly matches one of the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 9: This context is about Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport and mentions it is in Puerto Rico, which is a territory of the United States, matching the other reasoning step.

6. Context idx 0, 2, 3, 6, 7: These contexts are about airports in different countries and do not match the reasoning steps or the claim.

Therefore, the contexts that are most relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim are ranked as follows:

It is likely to contain the answer to the claim because it specifies the location of the airport in relation to the United States.

2. Context idx 4: This context is about Arnold Palmer Regional Airport and mentions that it is located in Pennsylvania, United States. This directly addresses the other reasoning step and is also highly relevant to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim because it specifies the location of the airport within the United States.

3. Context idx 1: This context is about Dorado Airport, which is also located in Puerto Rico. While it does not directly address the claim, it is related to the location of Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport by virtue of being in the same territory. It is less directly relevant than the first two contexts but still has some relevance.

The context about Cairo Regional Airport (idx 8) is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either of the airports in question or their locations in relation to countries.

Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Vishal Bhardwaj and details his awards, including the National Film Award for Best Music Direction, which directly answers the claim. 2. Context idx 5: This context is about the film "Pataakha" directed by Vishal Bhardwaj and mentions awards related to the film, making it relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9: These contexts mention other composers and are not relevant to the claim about Vishal Bhardwaj and the film "Pataakha".

step-by-step think: The claim is about an award won by Vishal Bhardwaj for the film Pataakha. The reasoning steps highlight that the composer won the National Film Award for Best Music Direction. Therefore, the contexts must be evaluated for their relevance to these points.
1. Context 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Vishal Bhardwaj and his receipt of the National Film Award for Best Music Direction, directly matching the reasoning steps.
2. Context 5: This context is relevant because it discusses the film Pataakha and mentions awards related to the film, although it does not specify the award won by Bhardwaj.

Context 9 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Pharoahe Monch and his place of birth, Queens. 2.

Context idx 3: This context is about Bernie Bonvoisin, who has no apparent connection to Pharoahe Monch or the claim, making it the least relevant of the top four.
idx: [9, 4, 2, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with idx 9 titled 'Pharoahe Monch' is the most relevant as it directly mentions Pharoahe Monch and his place of birth, which is Queens, matching perfectly with the reasoning steps. 2. Context with idx 4 titled 'Damage (Pharoahe Monch song)' is relevant as it discusses the song 'Damage' by Pharoahe Monch, but it does not mention his place of birth.

Question:Are The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 Film) and Man On Wire both from the same country?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to identify the country of origin for both "The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)" and "Man on Wire." The reasoning steps indicate that the former is American and the latter is British and also American. Therefore, we need to find contexts that match these entities and relationships.

2. Context 6: This context is about "Man on Wire," confirming its British-American origin, which matches the reasoning steps.
3. Context 7: This context discusses "The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)," which is related but less directly than context 3.
4. Context 9: This context mentions "The Man Who Knew Too Little," which is a parody of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and could be misleading but still relevant.
5. Context 4: This context is about "The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963 film)," which is related in title but not in content to the claim.
6. Context 5: This context is about "The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1969 film)," which is again related in title but not in content to the claim.
7. Context 1: This context is about "The Man Who Knew Love," which has a similar title but is unrelated to the claim.
8. Context 0: This context is about "Hajen som visste för mycket," which is unrelated to the claim and does not match the reasoning steps.

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it confirms 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)' is an American film, which matches one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 6: This context is also highly relevant as it mentions 'Man on Wire' being a British-American film, addressing two reasoning steps about the country of origin. 3. Context idx 7: This context is about the 1934 version of 'The Man Who Knew Too Much', which is British. It's less relevant to the claim but still provides useful information regarding the country of origin for a related film. 4. Context idx 9: This context is about 'The Man Who Knew Too Little', which is a parody of the Hitchcock films but does not provide direct information about the country of origin; however, it is related to the main subject of the claim.

However, context with index 0 mentions a person with the surname Holden and a birth date, which might be slightly more relevant than the others. 4. Context with index 1 mentions a person with the surname Holden and a birth date, similar to context 0, but is less relevant than context 0 due to the lack of connection to the film industry.
idx: [4, 9, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with index 4: This context directly mentions Michael Thornhill and states his place of birth as Sydney, Australia, which matches perfectly with the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and informative, and it is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context with index 9: This context is about the film "The FJ Holden" directed by Michael Thornhill. It provides background on the film and its director, making it relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention Thornhill's place of birth, so it is less likely to contain the answer compared to context 4. 3. Context with index 0: This context is about Doug Holden, who is not related to the claim. It is not relevant and unlikely to contain the answer. 4. Context with index 1: This context is about Amanda Holden, a writer, and is not relevant to the claim about Michael Thornhill. It is unlikely to contain the answer.

golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born later between Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose and Princess Raiyah Bint Hussein, we need to compare their dates of birth. 1. "Princess Raiyah bint Hussein" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Princess Raiyah bint Hussein and provides her date of birth, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. "Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose" context: This context is also directly relevant as it mentions Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose and provides her date of birth. 3. "Princess Iman bint Hussein" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions a family member related to Princess Raiyah bint Hussein, which could be useful for cross-referencing family data. 4. "Princess Aisha bint Hussein" context: Similar to the previous context, this one is relevant due to the mention of Princess Raiyah bint Hussein's family. 5. "Princess Zein bint Hussein" context: This context is relevant for the same reasons as the previous two; it mentions a family member of Princess Raiyah bint Hussein. 6. "Princess Alia bint Hussein" context: This context is relevant as it mentions another family member of Princess Raiyah bint Hussein. 7. "Princess Hwahyeop" context: This context is less relevant because it does not directly relate to the claim but mentions a princess and could potentially be confused with the individuals in question. 8. "Faika of Egypt" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention the individuals in the claim or their family members but is included because it mentions royalty and could potentially be used for cross-referencing historical periods.
idx: [6, 7, 4, 3, 5, 8, 2, 0]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 6: This context directly mentions Princess Raiyah bint Hussein and her date of birth, which is one of the entities in the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: This context directly mentions Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose and her date of birth, which is the other entity in the reasoning steps. It is equally relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 4: This context mentions Princess Iman bint Hussein, who is related to Princess Raiyah bint Hussein. It is less directly related to the claim but still relevant due to the family connection. 4. Context idx 3: This context mentions Princess Aisha bint Hussein, who is also related to Princess Raiyah bint Hussein. It is relevant due to the family connection but does not directly address the claim.
idx: [6, 7, 4, 3]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born later between Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose and Princess Raiyah Bint Hussein, we need to compare their dates of birth. 1. The context for "Princess Raiyah bint Hussein" directly provides the date of birth as 9 February 1986, which is crucial for answering the claim. 2. The context for "Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose" also directly provides the date of birth as 25 September 1738, which is necessary to compare with Princess Raiyah's date of birth. 3. The contexts for "Princess Iman bint Hussein" and "Princess Aisha bint Hussein" mention other family members' dates of birth, which are not directly relevant to the claim but could provide additional context for the family's generational timeline. However, they are less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention the individuals in question.

step-by-step think: To address the claim about the nationality of Imperial Noble Consort Chunhui's husband, we need to identify contexts that mention her and the Qianlong Emperor, as well as the Qing dynasty. 1. Context 5 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Imperial Noble Consort Chunhui and her relationship with the Qianlong Emperor. 2. Context 4 provides detailed information about the Qianlong Emperor, which is directly related to the claim. 3.

Context 1 mentions the Kangxi Emperor, who is related to the Qianlong Emperor as his grandfather, providing some relevance. 7. Context 2 mentions the Guangxu Emperor, which is less relevant to the claim. 8.

idx: [5, 4, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it provides extensive information about the Qianlong Emperor, including his reign and life details. It directly addresses the second reasoning step, mentioning the Qing dynasty, which is crucial for determining the nationality of the emperor. 2. Context idx 5: This context is directly about Imperial Noble Consort Chunhui and mentions her relationship with the Qianlong Emperor, addressing the first reasoning step.

Question:Who is younger, Nicolas Görtler or Michel De Salzmann?
golden idx: [3, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Nicolas Görtler and Michel de Salzmann, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are 'Nicolas Görtler date of birth 8 March 1990' and 'Michel de Salzmann date of birth 31 December 1923'. Based on these dates, Nicolas Görtler is younger than Michel de Salzmann. Now, to rank the contexts, we need to find which contexts mention these individuals and their dates of birth.

1. Context 3 mentions Nicolas Görtler and his date of birth, directly addressing half of the claim.
2. Context 8 mentions Michel de Salzmann and his date of birth, directly addressing the other half of the claim.
3. Context 7 mentions Jeanne de Salzmann, who is related to Michel de Salzmann, and provides context about the family.
4. The remaining contexts mention different individuals named Michel and are not directly relevant to the claim. However, they might contain useful background information about the name 'Michel' and its cultural or historical significance, which could be indirectly relevant.
5. Contexts 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 do not mention either of the individuals in the claim and are therefore ranked lower.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the contexts are ranked as follows:
idx: [3, 8, 7, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 3: This context directly mentions Nicolas Görtler and provides his date of birth, which is essential for answering the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context directly mentions Michel de Salzmann and provides his date of birth, which is essential for answering the claim. 3. Context idx 7: This context is about Jeanne de Salzmann, who is related to Michel de Salzmann, and provides additional background information that could be relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 0: This context mentions a different Michel (Michel Gomes) with a birth date close to Nicolas Görtler's, which might cause confusion but is still relevant due to the birth date information. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the individuals in question or relevant birth dates.
idx: [3, 8, 7, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with idx 3: This context directly mentions Nicolas Görtler and provides his date of birth, which is one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context with idx 8: This context directly mentions Michel de Salzmann and provides his date of birth, which is the other reasoning step. It is equally relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context with idx 7: Although this context is about Jeanne de Salzmann, it mentions Michel de Salzmann and provides some background information which is related to the claim but does not directly address the claim's question. It is less relevant than the first two contexts but still contains useful information. 4. Context with idx 0: This context is about Michel Gomes, who is not related to the claim. It is the least relevant and unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

The reasoning steps provided are "Passer l'hiver country of origin French" and "In My Skin country of origin French". Therefore, the contexts that mention the country of origin as France for both movies should be ranked highest. 1. Context idx 0: This context directly relates to "Passer L'Hiver" and confirms its country of origin as France. 2. Context idx 1: This context directly relates to "In My Skin" and confirms its country of origin as France. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. The other contexts either refer to different movies or do not provide information about the country of origin, making them less relevant. 3. Context idx 2: This context is about "On My Skin", which is a different movie and Italian, not French. 4. Context idx 3: This is a duplicate of context idx 2. 5.

Context idx 0 ("Passer l'hiver"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the film "Passer l'hiver" and confirms its French origin, which matches one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 1 ('In My Skin'): This context is equally relevant as it directly mentions the film "In My Skin" and confirms its French origin, aligning with the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 2 and 3 ('On My Skin'): These contexts mention a film with a similar title but confirm it is an Italian film, which is not relevant to the claim. 4.

Question:What is the place of birth of Consort Liang's husband?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the place of birth of Consort Liang's husband, who is Emperor Zhang of Han. The reasoning steps guide us to look for contexts that mention Consort Liang's spouse and Emperor Zhang of Han's place of birth. 1.

It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Consort Liang" context: This context is about Consort Liang and mentions her relationship with Emperor Zhang of Han.

1. Context 3: "Emperor Zhang of Han" - This context is directly relevant as it provides detailed information about Emperor Zhang of Han, who is Consort Liang's spouse. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim regarding his place of birth.
2. Context 6: "Consort Liang" - This context is relevant because it discusses Consort Liang and her relationship with Emperor Zhang of Han. It may contain indirect information about his place of birth.
3. Context 0: "Xu Liang (footballer)" - Although this context mentions a Chinese individual's place of birth, it is not directly related to Emperor Zhang of Han or Consort Liang.
4. Context 1: "Guo Liang (actor)" - Similar to context 0, it mentions a Chinese individual's place of birth but is unrelated to the claim.
5. Context 2: "Yan Liang (handballer)" - This context is also similar to contexts 0 and 1, mentioning a Chinese individual's place of birth but not related to the claim.

It provides detailed information about his reign and actions as emperor, which is closely related to the claim. 2. Context idx 6 "Consort Liang": This context is also highly relevant because it discusses Consort Liang directly and mentions her relationship with Emperor Zhang of Han. It provides personal details about her life and her son, which could lead to information about her husband's place of birth. 3. Context idx 0 "Xu Liang (footballer)": This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different person who shares a similar name but is not related to the historical figures in question. 4. Context idx 1 "Guo Liang (actor)": Similar to idx 0, this context is about a different individual unrelated to the claim and therefore is not relevant.

Question:Where did Muza Niyazova's husband die?
golden idx: [3, 4]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about Muza Niyazova's husband's place of death and the presence of entities or relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps. 1. Context 4: This context is directly about Saparmurat Niyazov and is likely to contain information about his place of death. 2. Context 3: This context mentions Muza Niyazova and her relationship with Saparmurat Niyazov, making it relevant. 3. Context 8: The title 'Place of birth' is somewhat related to the concept of place of death, but the text does not seem to contain the specific answer. 4. Context 6: 'Place of origin' is related to the concept of place of death, but less directly than 'Place of birth'. 5. Context 1: The title 'Sennedjem' is not directly related, but the text mentions a place of death, which could be conceptually similar. 6. Context 0: The title 'Where Was I' could be interpreted as related to a location, but the text does not provide relevant information. 7. Context 2: 'Motherland (disambiguation)' is not directly related but could be conceptually similar to the place of death. 8. Context 5: 'Dance of Death (disambiguation)' is conceptually related to death but not to the specific claim. The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim.
idx: [4, 3, 8, 6, 1, 0, 2, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the place of death of Muza Niyazova's husband, Saparmurat Niyazov. The reasoning steps provided are 'Muza Niyazova spouse Saparmurat Niyazov' and 'Saparmurat Niyazov place of death Ashgabat'. Based on these, the contexts should be ranked as follows:
1. Context idx 4: This context is about Saparmurat Niyazov and provides extensive information about his life and rule. It is highly relevant as it mentions his death and his significant actions as the leader of Turkmenistan. However, it does not explicitly mention the place of his death, which is central to the claim.
2. Context idx 3: This context mentions Muza Niyazova and identifies her as the widow of Saparmurat Niyazov, which is directly relevant to the claim. It does not provide information about the place of death, but it is closely related to the entities in question.
3. Context idx 6: The title 'Place of origin' is somewhat related to the concept of place of death, but the content of the context is about the Swiss system of municipal citizenship and does not provide information about Saparmurat Niyazov or his place of death.
4. Context idx 8: The title 'Place of birth' is related to the concept of place of death, but the paragraph text discusses the general concept of place of birth and does not mention Saparmurat Niyazov or his place of death.

The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim or the reasoning steps and therefore are not included in the top four.
idx: [4, 3, 6, 8]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim about the place of death of Muza Niyazova's husband, Saparmurat Niyazov, and the reasoning steps provided. 1. Context idx 4 titled 'Saparmurat Niyazov' is the most relevant as it provides extensive information about Niyazov, including his leadership of Turkmenistan and his policies. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim since it discusses his rule and actions up to his death. 2. Context idx 3 titled 'Muza Niyazova' is relevant because it identifies her as the widow of Saparmurat Niyazov, which directly connects to the claim. However, it does not mention the place of death, making it less likely to contain the answer than context idx 4. 3. Context idx 8 titled 'Place of birth' is less relevant than the previous contexts as it discusses the concept of place of birth in general and does not mention Niyazov. However, it is more relevant than context idx 6 because it deals with the concept of birth and death places, which is related to the claim. Context idx 6 titled 'Place of origin' is the least relevant as it discusses the Swiss concept of municipal citizenship, which is unrelated to the claim about Niyazov's place of death.

It is equally informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Bagatora railway station" context: While this context mentions a railway station in Pakistan, it does not directly address the claim or the reasoning steps related to Muzaffargarh or Raisan stations. However, it is still relevant due to the mention of Pakistan. 4. "Pai Khel railway station" context: This context also mentions a railway station located in Pakistan, making it somewhat relevant, but it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention Muzaffargarh or Raisan stations.

Question:Do John Amyas Alexander and Albert Seward share the same nationality?
golden idx: [5, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine the ranking of the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 

1. Context idx 5: This context is directly about John Amyas Alexander and mentions his activities and affiliations, which are likely to include information about his nationality.
2. Context idx 6: This context is directly about Albert Seward and mentions his contributions, which are likely to include information about his nationality.
3. Context idx 7: This context mentions Christopher James Alexander, who shares the surname with John Amyas Alexander, and discusses his English heritage, which may be relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 3: This context mentions John Alexander in the context of the Australian Open, which could potentially confuse with John Amyas Alexander but is less likely to contain information about his nationality.
5. Context idx 8: This context also mentions John Alexander but in the context of the Bristol Open, which is again less likely to contain information about his nationality.
6. Context idx 4: This context discusses a historical figure named Alexander, which is less relevant to the claim but could contain information about nationality in a broader sense.
7. Context idx 0, 1, 2: These contexts mention the Victoria and Albert Museum and individuals associated with it, which are not directly relevant to the claim but could potentially contain information about British citizenship in a broader context.
8. Context idx 9: This context is about the Alexander and Rich Mountain Railway, which is the least relevant to the claim and unlikely to contain information about the nationalities of John Amyas Alexander or Albert Seward.

Based on these considerations, the contexts are ranked as follows:
idx: [5, 6, 7, 3, 8, 4, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions John Amyas Alexander and provides information about his activities and affiliations, which are likely to include his nationality. 2. Context idx 6: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions Albert Seward and labels him as a British botanist and geologist, which is directly related to the claim about sharing the same nationality. 3. Context idx 7: This context mentions Christopher James Alexander, who is English, and provides background information that might be indirectly relevant to the claim. However, it does not directly address the claim about John Amyas Alexander or Albert Seward. 4. Context idx 0: This context talks about Holly Trusted, a historian of British and Spanish sculpture, which might be less relevant to the claim but is included due to the mention of British context. The other contexts are not relevant as they do not mention the individuals in question or their nationalities.
idx: [5, 6, 7, 0]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions John Amyas Alexander and provides detailed information about his career and affiliations, which are likely to include his nationality. 2. Context idx 6: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions Albert Seward and labels him as a British botanist and geologist, which addresses the claim about his nationality. 3. Context idx 7: This context mentions Christopher James Alexander, who is not directly related to the claim but shares the surname 'Alexander'. It provides information about his family and career, which might indirectly confirm the nationality of John Amyas Alexander if they are related. 4. Context idx 0: This context is about Holly Trusted, who is associated with British history and institutions. However, it does not directly address the claim about John Amyas Alexander and Albert Seward's nationality.

Question:Who is younger, Bernard Chambaz or Tibor Pézsa?
golden idx: [0, 3]
step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Bernard Chambaz and Tibor Pézsa, we need to compare their dates of birth. The context titled 'Tibor Pézsa' directly mentions his date of birth as 15 November 1935, which is crucial for answering the claim. Similarly, the context titled 'Bernard Chambaz' provides his date of birth as 18 May 1949, which is also essential for the comparison. The other contexts do not mention dates of birth and are therefore not relevant to the claim. Based on the reasoning steps, we can infer that Bernard Chambaz is younger than Tibor Pézsa since his birth year is later.
idx: [3, 0]

step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Bernard Chambaz and Tibor Pézsa, we need to compare their dates of birth. The context titled "Tibor Pézsa" directly provides the birth date of Tibor Pézsa as 15 November 1935, which is crucial for answering the claim. Similarly, the context titled "Bernard Chambaz" provides the birth date of Bernard Chambaz as 18 May 1949. These two contexts are the most relevant as they contain the exact information needed to answer the question. The other contexts mention various individuals and their birth dates, but since they are not the subjects of the claim, they are not relevant. Therefore, the contexts about Tibor Pézsa and Bernard Chambaz should be ranked highest.
idx: [0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Bernard Chambaz and Tibor Pézsa, we need to compare their dates of birth. 1. The context titled "Bernard Chambaz" directly provides the date of birth of Bernard Chambaz as 18 May 1949, which is essential to answer the claim. 2. The context titled "Tibor Pézsa" provides the date of birth of Tibor Pézsa as 15 November 1935, which is also directly relevant to the claim. 3. The other contexts titled "Anton Shunto" and "Tiberiu Olah" are not relevant to the claim as they do not provide information about the individuals in question. Therefore, they are ranked lower.

Question:Which award the composer of film Bhookh (1947 Film) won?
golden idx: [6, 9]
step-by-step think: The most relevant context to the claim is the one that mentions both "Anil Biswas" and the "Sangeet Natak Akademi Award". Context 9 is the most informative as it directly mentions Anil Biswas, his contributions to Indian cinema, and the fact that he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. Context 6 mentions the film "Bhookh" and Anil Biswas as the composer, which is directly related to the claim. The other contexts mention various composers and their work, but they do not pertain to Anil Biswas or the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, making them less relevant. Therefore, they are ranked lower.
idx: [9, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think:1. Context index 9 "Anil Biswas (composer)" is the most relevant as it directly mentions Anil Biswas and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, which are both entities in the reasoning steps. It is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context index 6 "Bhookh (1947 film)" is relevant because it mentions the film "Bhookh" and Anil Biswas as the composer, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not mention the award, making it slightly less relevant than context index 9. 3. The remaining contexts (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Anil Biswas or the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. They are about other composers and do not provide information related to the claim. Therefore, they are all equally less relevant and unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [9, 6, 0, 1]

step-by-step think:1. Context index 9: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Anil Biswas and provides detailed information about his career and achievements, including the specific award in question, the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, which he received in 1986. It matches perfectly with both reasoning steps. 2. Context index 6: This context is about the film "Bhookh" for which Anil Biswas composed the music. It is relevant to the claim but does not mention the award, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to context index 9. 3. Context index 0 and 1: Both contexts are about other composers and do not relate to Anil Biswas or the film "Bhookh". They do not match the reasoning steps and are unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [9, 6, 0]

Question:Who is Joan, Countess Of Chiny's paternal grandfather?
golden idx: [2, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine Joan, Countess of Chiny's paternal grandfather, we need to identify her father and then his father. The reasoning steps provided are: 'Joan, Countess of Chiny father Louis IV, Count of Chiny', 'Louis IV, Count of Chiny father Louis III, Count of Chiny'. Therefore, the contexts that mention Louis IV and Louis III are most relevant.
1. Context idx 2: This context mentions Louis IV, Count of Chiny, as Joan's father and Louis III as his father, directly answering the claim.
2. Context idx 1: This context mentions Louis III, Count of Chiny, and provides information about his life and offspring, making it highly relevant.
3. Context idx 7: This context mentions Joan, Countess of Chiny, and her father Louis IV, making it relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 6: This context is about Louis V, Count of Chiny, who is related to the family in question but does not directly answer the claim.
5. Context idx 5: This context is about John I, Count of Looz, who is related to the family but does not provide information about Joan's paternal grandfather.
6. Context idx 9: This context is about Otto II, Count of Chiny, who is part of the same lineage but further back in history and less directly related to the claim.
7. Context idx 3: This context is about Dodo of Cons, who married a countess of Chiny, making it somewhat relevant but not directly answering the claim.
8. Context idx 4: This context is about Louis, Count of Verdun, who was a Count of Chiny but does not provide information about Joan's paternal grandfather.
The remaining contexts (idx 0 and idx 8) are not relevant to the claim as they discuss individuals unrelated to the Chiny lineage.
idx: [2, 1, 7, 6, 5, 9, 3, 4]

step-by-step think: To determine Joan, Countess of Chiny's paternal grandfather, we need to identify her father and then his father. 1. 'Louis IV, Count of Chiny' context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Louis IV, who is Joan's father, and also mentions his father, Louis III, making it the most informative for the claim. 2. 'Louis III, Count of Chiny' context: This context is directly about Joan's grandfather, Louis III, and is therefore highly relevant to the claim. 3. 'Joan, Countess of Chiny' context: This context is about Joan herself and mentions her father, Louis IV, which makes it relevant but less so than the contexts about Louis IV and Louis III directly. 4. 'Louis V, Count of Chiny' context: This context mentions Louis V, who is related to Joan, but it is less directly relevant to the claim than the contexts that mention her father and grandfather. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the direct lineage or provide information about Joan's paternal grandfather.
idx: [2, 1, 7, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Louis III, Count of Chiny" context: This context is directly relevant to the claim as it mentions Louis III, Count of Chiny, who is identified in the reasoning steps as the father of Louis IV, Count of Chiny, and therefore Joan's paternal grandfather. It is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Louis IV, Count of Chiny" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Louis IV, Count of Chiny, who is Joan's father. It provides background information about his reign and family, which is useful for establishing lineage. 3. "Joan, Countess of Chiny" context: This context is about Joan herself and mentions her father, Louis IV, Count of Chiny, and her marriage, which indirectly relates to the claim. It is less directly related to the claim than the first two contexts but still contains relevant information.

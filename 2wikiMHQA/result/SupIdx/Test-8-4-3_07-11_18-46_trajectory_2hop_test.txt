Question:Where was the place of burial of Ælfgar, Earl Of Mercia's mother?
golden idx: [1, 4]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 
1. Context 4 ("Lady Godiva"): This context is directly related to Godgifu (Lady Godiva), who is Ælfgar's mother, and mentions Coventry, which is the place of burial according to the reasoning steps.
2. Context 1 ("Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia"): This context is about Ælfgar and mentions his mother Godgifu, making it highly relevant to the claim.
3. Context 5 ("Ealdgyth (daughter of Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia)"): This context is related to Ælfgar's family and could potentially contain information about his mother's burial place.
4. Context 0 ("Place of birth"): While this context discusses the concept of place of birth, it could be tangentially related to the place of burial.
5. Context 2 ("Sarre Anglo-Saxon cemetery"): This context is about a place of burial, but not specifically related to Godgifu.
6. Context 8 ("Emperor Daigo"): This context mentions a place of burial, but it is unrelated to the claim.
7. Context 7 ("William Rockhill Nelson"): This context includes specific information about a place of burial, but again, it is unrelated to the claim.
8. Context 6 ("Sennedjem"): This context is about an individual's burial, but not related to the claim.
The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim or the reasoning steps and therefore are not included in the top 8.
idx: [4, 1, 5, 0, 2, 8, 7, 6]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim about Ælfgar, Earl Of Mercia's mother's place of burial and the reasoning steps provided. 1. Context idx 4 ("Lady Godiva"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Godiva (Godgifu), who is Ælfgar's mother, and it also mentions Coventry, which is related to the reasoning step 'Godgifu place of burial Coventry'. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 1 ("Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia"): This context is relevant because it mentions Ælfgar and his mother Godgifu, providing background information that could lead to the answer. 3. Context idx 5 ("Ealdgyth (daughter of Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia)"): This context is less directly related to the claim but still relevant as it discusses Ælfgar's family. 4. Context idx 2 ("Sarre Anglo-Saxon cemetery"): This context is about a place of burial and could potentially contain information about burial practices relevant to the claim, even though it does not directly mention Godgifu or Coventry.
idx: [4, 1, 5, 2]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 4 "Lady Godiva": This context is highly relevant as it mentions Godiva (Godgifu), who is Ælfgar's mother, and it also mentions Coventry, which is the place of burial according to the reasoning steps. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 1 "Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia": This context is relevant because it mentions Ælfgar and his mother Godgifu (Lady Godiva), providing background information that could lead to the answer about her place of burial. 3. Context idx 5 "Ealdgyth (daughter of Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia)": This context is less directly related to the claim but still relevant as it discusses Ælfgar's family, which could potentially include information about his mother's burial place. The context idx 2 "Sarre Anglo-Saxon cemetery" is not relevant as it does not mention Godgifu or Coventry and is about a different time period.

Question:Which country Dexter Young's mother is from?
golden idx: [3, 4]
step-by-step think: To determine the ranking, I will consider how well each context matches the reasoning steps and the claim. The claim is about the country of citizenship of Dexter Young's mother, Connie Chan. The reasoning steps indicate that Connie Chan is from China. Therefore, contexts that mention Dexter Young, Connie Chan, and China will be ranked higher.

1. Context 4 mentions Dexter Young and his mother, Connie Chan, which directly relates to the claim.
2. Context 3 mentions Dexter Young, but not his mother or her country of citizenship.
3. Context 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not mention Dexter Young, Connie Chan, or China, making them less relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the reasoning steps, the contexts are ranked as follows:
idx: [4, 3, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context 4 "Connie Chan": This context is highly relevant as it mentions Connie Chan and her place of birth, Guangdong, China, which directly addresses the claim and the reasoning steps. 2. Context 3 "Dexter Young": This context is relevant because it confirms Dexter Young is the son of Connie Chan, which is a direct link to the claim. 3. Context 5 "Chitra Shenoy": Although this context is less relevant, it mentions the term 'young mother', which might loosely connect to the claim about Dexter Young's mother. 4. Context 7 "Patricia Canning Todd": This context is the least relevant among the top four, but it includes a mention of a 'young mother', which provides a weak link to the claim.
idx: [4, 3, 5, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Connie Chan" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Connie Chan and provides detailed information about her life, including her place of birth in China, which is crucial to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Dexter Young" context: This context is relevant because it confirms Dexter Young is the son of Connie Chan, which is a direct link to the claim. However, it does not mention Connie Chan's country of citizenship, so it is less likely to contain the answer compared to the first context. 3. "Chitra Shenoy" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different person who is not related to Dexter Young or Connie Chan. It is informative but does not likely contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Patricia Canning Todd" context: This context is also not relevant to the claim as it discusses an American tennis player and does not provide any information related to Dexter Young or Connie Chan.

The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not mention Eva Dahlgren, the song, or her spouse.
idx: [3, 2, 1, 5]

step-by-step think:1. Context 3 titled "Eva Dahlgren" is the most relevant as it directly mentions Eva Dahlgren and provides detailed information about her life, including her relationship with Efva Attling, which is directly related to the claim. 2. Context 2 titled "Ängeln i rummet" is relevant as it discusses the song by Eva Dahlgren but does not mention her spouse, making it slightly less relevant than context 3. 3. Context 1 titled "Mehdi Abrishamchi" and context 5 titled "Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg" are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Eva Dahlgren or the song "Ängeln i rummet," nor do they provide information about her spouse.

Question:Which film was released more recently, Circus Of Love or The Kiss Of Evil?
golden idx: [8, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well the context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 1. Context idx 9 ("Circus of Love"): This context is directly relevant as it mentions "Circus of Love" and its publication date of 1954, which is one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 8 ("The Kiss of Evil"): This context is also directly relevant as it mentions "The Kiss of Evil" and its publication date of 2011, which is the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 0 ("The Kiss of the Vampire"): This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions "Kiss of Evil" in its alternate title, but it refers to a different film from 1963, not the one from 2011. 4. Context idx 4 ("The Kiss of Judas (film)"): This context is less relevant as it does not match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps but shares a similar title element "The Kiss of". 5. Context idx 1 ("The Kiss of Hate"): This context has a title that partially matches the reasoning steps but is about a completely different film from 1916. 6. Context idx 2 ("Dreams of Love"): This context is not directly relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps. 7. Context idx 3 ("Season of Love"): This context is also not directly relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps. 8. Context idx 5 ("Colour of Love"): This context, like the previous two, does not directly relate to the claim or the reasoning steps.
idx: [9, 8, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "The Kiss of Evil" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the film "The Kiss of Evil" and provides its publication date of 2011, which is essential for addressing the claim. 2. "Circus of Love" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions "Circus of Love" and provides its publication date of 1954, which is necessary to compare with "The Kiss of Evil." 3. "The Kiss of the Vampire" context: This context is less relevant because, despite having a similar title, it refers to a different film and provides a publication date of 1963, which does not directly help in determining the more recent film between the two in question. 4. "The Kiss of Judas (film)" context: This context is the least relevant of the top four because it does not provide any publication date or direct information about the films in question, but it has a title that could potentially be confused with "The Kiss of Evil."
idx: [8, 9, 0, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "The Kiss of Evil" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions "The Kiss of Evil" and provides the publication date of 2011, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Circus of Love" context: This context is also directly relevant as it mentions "Circus of Love" and provides the publication date of 1954, which matches the other reasoning step. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "The Kiss of the Vampire" context: Although this context mentions a title similar to "The Kiss of Evil," it refers to a different film released in 1963, which does not match the reasoning steps as closely as the first two contexts. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly match the reasoning steps.

Context idx 2: This context is about "Keeper of the Bees," which is similar to "Tell It to the Bees," but it's a different film from 1947. 6. Context idx 5: This context is about "The Keeper of the Bees," a film from 1925, which could be confused with "Tell It to the Bees," but it's not the same film. 7. Context idx 1: This context is titled "The Bees," which is related to "Tell It to the Bees," but it does not provide any publication date or specific information about the film. 8. Context idx 7: This context is titled "Three for Happiness," which includes the word "Happiness" but is unrelated to the films in question.
idx: [3,9,4,0,2,5,1,7]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. The claim is about determining which film was released earlier, "Man's Search for Happiness" or "Tell It to the Bees." The reasoning steps provided are the publication dates for both films. 

1. Context idx 3 ("Man's Search for Happiness"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the title "Man's Search for Happiness" and provides the specific year of release, 1964, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is informative and directly answers the claim.

2. Context idx 9 ("Tell It to the Bees"): This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions the title "Tell It to the Bees" and provides detailed release information, including the year 2019, which matches the other reasoning step. It is informative and directly answers the claim.

3. Context idx 2 ("Keeper of the Bees (1947 film)"): This context is less relevant because it mentions a different film with a similar name but does not provide information about "Tell It to the Bees." However, it could potentially confuse the answer due to the similarity in titles.

4. Context idx 5 ("The Keeper of the Bees (1925 film)"): This context is also less relevant for the same reasons as idx 2. It mentions a film with a similar name but is not directly related to the claim.

The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention either of the films in question or provide any information that would help determine the release dates of the films.

idx: [3, 9, 2, 5]

step-by-step think: The task is to determine which film was released earlier, "Man's Search for Happiness" or "Tell It to the Bees," based on their publication dates. The reasoning steps provided are "Man's Search for Happiness publication date 1964" and "Tell It to the Bees publication date 2019." Therefore, the contexts will be ranked based on how well they match these entities and dates, their relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 3 ("Man's Search for Happiness"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the title "Man's Search for Happiness" and confirms the publication date as 1964, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is informative and directly answers the claim by providing the specific year of release.

2. Context idx 9 ("Tell It to the Bees"): This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions the title "Tell It to the Bees" and provides detailed information about its release, including the premiere in 2018 and the theatrical release in 2019, which aligns with the reasoning step for this film. It is informative and directly answers the claim by providing the specific year of release.

3. Context idx 2 ("Keeper of the Bees (1947 film)"): While this context is informative and provides a publication date for a film titled "Keeper of the Bees," it does not directly address the claim since it is about a different film and thus is less relevant than the first two contexts.

4. Context idx 5 ("The Keeper of the Bees (1925 film)"): Similar to context idx 2, this context provides information about a film with a similar title but does not directly address the claim about the two films in question. It is informative but less relevant.

Based on the rules for ranking, the top three contexts in order of relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim are contexts 3, 9, and 2.

Context with idx 2 titled 'Gustaf Molander' is the most relevant as it directly mentions Gustaf Molander's place of birth, which is Helsingfors, and provides extensive information about his career and background. This context matches perfectly with the reasoning steps and is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context with idx 5 titled "A Woman's Face (1938 film)" is relevant because it mentions the film directed by Gustaf Molander, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not mention his place of birth, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to the first context. 3. Context with idx 8 titled 'Eric Bengtson' mentions the film "A Woman's Face" and the year 1938, which are related to the claim, but it does not provide information about Gustaf Molander or his place of birth, making it less relevant than the first two contexts. The context with idx 6 titled 'Olav Aaraas' is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Gustaf Molander or the film at all.

Question:Which school was opened first, Chopasni Senior Secondary School, Jodhpur or Tunku Putra School?
golden idx: [7, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is about determining which school was opened first between Chopasni Senior Secondary School, Jodhpur and Tunku Putra School. The reasoning steps provided are 'Chopasni Senior Secondary School, Jodhpur inception 1875' and 'Tunku Putra School inception 1997'. Therefore, the contexts that directly mention these schools and their inception dates are most relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 1. Context idx 7: This context is about Chopasni Senior Secondary School, Jodhpur and mentions its establishment in 1875, which is directly relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context is about Tunku Putra School and mentions its establishment in 1997, which is also directly relevant to the claim. These two contexts are the most informative and have the highest likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. The other contexts mention various schools and their establishment dates, but since they do not pertain to the schools in question, they are less relevant. However, they can be ranked based on the closeness of their establishment dates to the dates mentioned in the reasoning steps. 3. Context idx 5: St. Crispin's Senior Secondary School, founded in 1895, is the next closest in terms of establishment date. 4. Context idx 4: G.B.S.S. School No.1, Shakti Nagar, established in 1957. 5. Context idx 3: St. Joseph Senior Secondary School, Chandigarh, founded in 1981. 6. Context idx 2: Columbia Foundation School, founded in 1985. 7. Context idx 9: Bhartiya Public Senior Secondary School, established in 1982. 8. Context idx 6: St Xavier's School, Jaipur, does not mention the establishment date, making it less informative. The remaining contexts do not mention relevant establishment dates or information related to the schools in question, thus are not included in the top 8.
idx: [7, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 9, 6]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 7: This context directly matches the claim and the reasoning steps as it provides the inception year of Chopasni Senior Secondary School, Jodhpur, which is 1875. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context also directly matches the claim and the reasoning steps as it provides the inception year of Tunku Putra School, which is 1997. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 5: St. Crispin's Senior Secondary School context is informative and provides its inception year, 1895, but it is not directly relevant to the claim about the two schools in question. 4. Context idx 4: G.B.S.S. School No.1, Shakti Nagar context provides detailed information about its establishment in 1957, but it is not directly relevant to the claim about Chopasni Senior Secondary School and Tunku Putra School.
idx: [7, 8, 5, 4]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 7: This context directly addresses the claim by mentioning the inception year of Chopasni Senior Secondary School, Jodhpur as 1875, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context also directly addresses the claim by stating the inception year of Tunku Putra School as 1997, aligning with the other reasoning step. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3.

However, it is informative and provides a founding year, which shows relevance to the type of information sought in the claim. 4. Context idx 4: This context is about G.B.S.S. School No.1, Shakti Nagar, and does not relate to the claim or the reasoning steps. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts that directly mention the schools in question.

Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde's father is Richard Burke, 2nd Earl of Clanricarde. Therefore, we are looking for contexts that mention Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde and his father, Richard Burke, 2nd Earl of Clanricarde.

1. Context idx 2 is the most relevant as it mentions Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde directly and provides information about his father, Richard Burke, 2nd Earl of Clanricarde, who is the paternal grandfather we are looking for.
2. Context idx 7 is the second most relevant because it mentions Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde and his father, Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde, which is directly related to the claim.
3. Context idx 4 mentions Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde as a land agent, which is somewhat relevant but does not provide information about his paternal grandfather.

5. Context idx 1 mentions a Richard Burke, 8th Earl of Clanricarde, which is not directly relevant to the claim but is related to the family.
6. Context idx 0 mentions the Clanricarde title but is focused on a different individual who is not directly relevant to the claim.

8. Context idx 9 mentions a William Burke, 7th Earl of Clanricarde, who is related to the family but not directly relevant to the claim.

The remaining contexts (idx 5 and idx 8) do not mention the individuals or relationships relevant to the claim and are therefore not included in the top 8 ranked contexts.
idx: [2, 7, 4, 6, 1, 0, 3, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde's paternal grandfather, we need to trace the lineage from Richard Burke to his father and then to his grandfather. 1.

idx: [2, 7, 6, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the paternal grandfather of Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde. According to the reasoning steps, we need to find the father of Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde, who is the father of Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde. Therefore, the context that mentions Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde's father will be the most relevant.
1. Context idx 2: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde and his father, Richard Burke, 2nd Earl of Clanricarde, directly addressing the claim and the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 7: This context is relevant as it mentions Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde and his father, Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde, but does not mention the paternal grandfather.
3. Context idx 6: This context is less relevant as it mentions Frances Walsingham, who married Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde, but does not provide information about his paternal grandfather.

idx: [8, 0, 2, 6, 3, 4, 7, 1]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 8 ("Akhenaten"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Akhenaten extensively, including details about his reign, religious changes, and death. It also mentions the city he built, Akhetaten, which is directly related to the reasoning step regarding Akhenaten's place of death. 2. Context idx 0 ("Meritaten"): This context is relevant because it discusses Meritaten and her relationship with Akhenaten, her father. It provides background information that could lead to details about Akhenaten's death. 3. Context idx 2 ("Meritaten Tasherit"): This context is less directly related to the claim but still relevant due to the mention of Meritaten and her possible relationship with Akhenaten. It may provide additional insights into the family and therefore potential clues about Akhenaten's place of death. 4. Context idx 3 ("Sennedjem"): While this context does not directly relate to the claim, it provides information about an individual from the same period and location, which might contain incidental information about Akhenaten's death.
idx: [8, 0, 2, 3]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 8 "Akhenaten": This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Akhenaten, Meritaten's father, and provides detailed information about his life, religious reforms, and the aftermath of his death. It also mentions Akhetaten, the city he built, which is directly related to the reasoning step regarding his place of death. Therefore, it is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 0 "Meritaten": This context is relevant because it discusses Meritaten and her relationship with Akhenaten, her father. It provides background on her lineage and her father's religious beliefs, which are closely related to the claim. However, it does not directly mention Akhenaten's place of death. 3. Context idx 2 "Meritaten Tasherit": This context is less directly related to the claim but still relevant as it discusses Meritaten's possible daughter and mentions Akhenaten, which could provide indirect clues about his death. It is less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts.

Context 8 ("Edward Despenser (died 1342)") is less directly relevant but still useful because it mentions descendants of Edward I. The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the entities or relationships specified in the reasoning steps.

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 4: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions James Fox-Lane and provides detailed information about his education at Christ's College, Cambridge, which is exactly what the claim is seeking. 2. Context idx 8: This context is relevant because it mentions George Lane-Fox as the son of James Fox-Lane, providing familial context which is indirectly related to the claim. 3. Context idx 1: This context talks about George Fox-Lane, 1st Baron Bingley, who is related to the family in question, but it does not provide information about James Fox-Lane's education. 4. Context idx 5: This context mentions the Lane-Fox family and provides some historical background, but it is less directly related to the claim compared to the others.
idx: [4, 8, 1, 5]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim and the reasoning steps provided. 1. Context with idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions James Fox-Lane and provides detailed information about his education at Christ's College, Cambridge, which is the exact answer to the claim. 2.

It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Christiane Vulpius" context: This context is about Christiane Vulpius herself and mentions her relationship with Goethe, making it relevant to the claim. 3.

However, it might be somewhat relevant due to the similarity in titles. 4.

It is less relevant than the previous context as it is a sequel to the second film. 5. "My Wife Is a Gangster" context: This context is the first film in the series mentioned in the other contexts but does not match the reasoning steps. It is less relevant than the sequels. 6. "My Wife's Enemy" context: This context has a similar title structure but does not provide information relevant to the claim or reasoning steps. 7.

Context idx 8: This context directly mentions "My Wife's Lodger" and its publication date of 1952, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 2: This context directly mentions "Ko 2" and its publication date of 2016, making it the second most relevant context. 3. Context idx 5: This context mentions "My Wife's Enemy," which has a similar title to "My Wife's Lodger" but is less relevant since it does not provide the publication date. 4. Context idx 7: This context mentions "My Wife's Lover," which also has a similar title to "My Wife's Lodger" but is less relevant than the previous contexts as it does not provide the publication date.
idx: [8, 2, 5, 7]

golden idx: [2, 5]
step-by-step think: To determine who died first between Louis-René De Caradeuc De La Chalotais or Hermann Friedrich Graebe, we need to compare their dates of death. The reasoning steps provided are 'Louis-René de Caradeuc de La Chalotais date of death July 12, 1785', and 'Hermann Friedrich Graebe date of death April 17, 1986'. Therefore, the contexts that directly mention these individuals and their dates of death are most relevant.

1. Context idx 5: This context is about Louis-René de Caradeuc de La Chalotais and mentions his date of death as July 12, 1785. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.

3. Context idx 3: This context mentions a Louis-René (des Forêts), but the dates do not match the claim. It is less relevant than the first two but still contains a name that partially matches the entities in the reasoning steps.
4. Context idx 0: This context mentions a Louis René (Beres), which is similar to the name in the claim but does not provide information on the death date. It is somewhat relevant due to the name match.
5. Context idx 1: This context mentions a René (de Brosse), which is less relevant as it does not match the entities in the reasoning steps and does not provide information on the death date.
6. Context idx 4: This context mentions a René (de Boer), which is less relevant as it does not match the entities in the reasoning steps and does not provide information on the death date.
7. Context idx 6: This context mentions a René (de Buzelet), which is less relevant as it does not match the entities in the reasoning steps and does not provide information on the death date.
8. Context idx 7: This context mentions a François-René, which is less relevant as it does not match the entities in the reasoning steps and does not provide information on the death date.

The remaining contexts (idx 8 and 9) are about individuals named Hermann but do not match the Hermann Friedrich Graebe in the claim and do not provide information on the death date, making them the least relevant to the claim.

idx: [5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To determine who died first, we need to compare the dates of death for Louis-René de Caradeuc de La Chalotais and Hermann Friedrich Graebe. The reasoning steps provide these dates as July 12, 1785, for La Chalotais and April 17, 1986, for Graebe. 
1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Louis-René de Caradeuc de La Chalotais and confirms his date of death as July 12, 1785.

It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 2: This context directly mentions Hermann Friedrich Graebe and provides the exact date of his death, which matches the other reasoning step. It is also highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 3: Although this context mentions a different Louis-René (Louis-René des Forêts), it is not as relevant because it does not provide information about the death date that is needed to answer the claim. However, it is more relevant than the remaining context because it at least mentions a similar name. 4. Context idx 0: This context is about Louis René Beres, who is not related to the claim at all. It is the least relevant and least likely to contain the answer to the claim.

Context idx 1: "William Adam (architect)" is the most relevant context as it directly mentions William Adam and provides extensive information about his life and works, which is likely to include the place of his death. 2. Context idx 4: "James Adam (architect)" is relevant because it mentions James Adam and his father William Adam, which could lead to information about William Adam's place of death. 3. Context idx 2: "James Adam, Lord Adam" is less relevant because it refers to a different James Adam, and there is no mention of William Adam or his place of death. 4. Context idx 7: "Jimmy Littlejohn" is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention William Adam or his place of death, but it is included because it mentions a person with a similar name, James Adam Littlejohn, which is less likely but still possible to contain the answer.

golden idx: [1, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the educational background of Margaret Beaufort, specifically where she graduated from. The reasoning steps provided are directly related to Margaret Beaufort and her education at St John's College. Therefore, the context that mentions Margaret Beaufort and her connection to St John's College should be ranked highest. Context 1 directly mentions Lady Margaret Beaufort and her establishment of two Cambridge colleges, including St John's College, which is highly relevant to the claim and the reasoning steps. None of the other contexts mention Margaret Beaufort or St John's College, so they will be ranked based on their relevance to the Tudor family and their educational endeavors, as this is the closest related topic to the claim.

idx: [1,8,0,2,3,4,5,7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context 1 titled "Lady Margaret Beaufort" is the most relevant as it directly mentions her founding of Christ's College and the development of St John's College, which aligns with the reasoning steps indicating her education at St John's College. 2. Context 8 titled "Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond" is the second most relevant as it mentions his marriage to Margaret Beaufort, directly linking her to the claim. 3. Context 0 titled "Lady Katherine Percy" is less relevant as it does not mention Margaret Beaufort or her education. 4. Context 2 titled "Henry Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Sussex" mentions Edmund Tudor as a relative, which provides a slight connection to the claim but is still less relevant than contexts 1 and 8.
idx: [1, 8, 0, 2]

step-by-step think: 1. Context 1 titled "Lady Margaret Beaufort" is the most relevant as it directly mentions Lady Margaret Beaufort and her connection to St John's College, which aligns with the reasoning steps. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context 8 titled "Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond" is relevant because it mentions Edmund Tudor's marriage to Margaret Beaufort, which is related to the claim. However, it does not mention her education, making it less likely to contain the answer than context 1. 3. Context 0 titled "Lady Katherine Percy" and context 2 titled "Henry Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Sussex" are not directly related to the claim or the reasoning steps, as they do not mention Lady Margaret Beaufort or her education. Therefore, they are less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

The claim is about the release dates of two films, "Aami" and "Bitch Slap." The reasoning steps provided are 'Aami publication date 2018' and 'Bitch Slap publication date 2009'. 

1. Context idx 2 ("Aami"): This context directly matches one of the reasoning steps, mentioning the film "Aami" and its release date in 2018. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 1 ("Bitch Slap"): This context also directly matches one of the reasoning steps, mentioning the film "Bitch Slap" and its release date in 2009. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 4 ("Ronaldo (film)"): This context is about a film released in 2015, which is between the release dates of "Aami" and "Bitch Slap." It is less relevant but provides a reference point for the release dates.
4. Context idx 5 ("The Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio"): This context mentions a film released in 2009, the same year as "Bitch Slap," but does not directly address the claim.
5. Context idx 6 ("Coney Island Baby (film)"): This context is about a film released in 2003, which is not directly relevant to the claim.
6. Context idx 0 ("Lloyd (film)"): This context is about a film released in 2001, which is not directly relevant to the claim.
7. Context idx 7 ("Battle in Outer Space"): This context is about a film released in 1960, which is not directly relevant to the claim.
8. Context idx 3 ("Invasion of the Neptune Men"): This context is about a film released in 1961, which is not directly relevant to the claim.

The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the films "Aami" or "Bitch Slap" or their release dates. Therefore, they are not included in the top 8 ranked contexts.

idx: [2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 0, 7, 3]

step-by-step think: The task is to determine which film, Aami or Bitch Slap, was released more recently. The reasoning steps provided are 'Aami publication date 2018' and 'Bitch Slap publication date 2009'. Based on these steps, the contexts need to be ranked according to their relevance to the publication dates of these films.

1. Context idx 2 (Aami): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the film 'Aami' and its release date in 2018, which matches one of the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 1 (Bitch Slap): This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions the film 'Bitch Slap' and its release date in 2009, which matches the other reasoning step.
3. Context idx 4 (Ronaldo): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film released in 2015.
4. Context idx 5 (The Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film released in 2009.
5. Context idx 6 (Coney Island Baby): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film released in 2003.
6. Context idx 0 (Lloyd): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film released in 2001.
7. Context idx 7 (Battle in Outer Space): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film released in 1960.
8. Context idx 3 (Invasion of the Neptune Men): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film released in 1961.

The top four contexts based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer are contexts 2, 1, 4, and 5. However, since contexts 4 and 5 discuss films released in the same year as Bitch Slap, they are less relevant than the contexts directly mentioning the films in question. Therefore, the ranking is based on the direct mention and relevance to the publication dates of Aami and Bitch Slap.
idx: [2, 1, 4, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Aami" context: This context is directly related to the claim and provides the exact publication date of the film "Aami," which is one of the films in question. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Bitch Slap" context: This context also directly relates to the claim by providing the publication date of "Bitch Slap," the other film in question. It is relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Ronaldo (film)" context: Although this context provides a publication date for the film "Ronaldo," it is not directly related to the claim about the films "Aami" or "Bitch Slap." However, it is informative and provides a publication date, which is relevant to the reasoning steps. 4. "The Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio" context: This context provides a publication date for a different film and does not relate to the films in question. It is less relevant compared to the contexts that directly mention "Aami" or "Bitch Slap."

"Fujiwara no Nagara" context: This context is about a grandfather-grandchild relationship in a historical Japanese context, which is not relevant to the claim. 7. "Guillaume Wittouck" context: This context mentions a grandfather but is unrelated to the claim about Busba Kitiyakara's family. 8.

idx: [1, 9, 5, 0, 2, 3, 4, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine the top 4 ranked contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 9 ("Nakkhatra Mangala"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions both Busba Kitiyakara's father, Nakkhatra Mangala, and her grandfather, Kitiyakara Voralaksana, directly addressing the claim and reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 1 ("Busba Kitiyakara"): This context is relevant because it mentions Busba Kitiyakara and her father, Nakkhatra Mangala, which is useful for identifying her paternal lineage.

4. Context idx 0 ("Lyon Cohen"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses Lyon Cohen, who is unrelated to Busba Kitiyakara's family.

The remaining contexts (idx 2, 3, 4, 6) are not relevant to the claim as they discuss individuals who are not related to Busba Kitiyakara's family lineage.

idx: [9, 1, 5, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "Nakkhatra Mangala" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Nakkhatra Mangala, who is the father of Busba Kitiyakara, and also mentions Kitiyakara Voralaksana, who is the grandfather in question. It provides direct information about the family lineage. 2. "Busba Kitiyakara" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Busba Kitiyakara and her father, Nakkhatra Mangala, but does not mention her grandfather. However, it is still informative and related to the claim. 3. "Thawisan Ladawan" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on the husband of Busba Kitiyakara and does not mention her father or grandfather. However, it is related to Busba Kitiyakara and could contain useful background information. 4. "Lyon Cohen" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different family and does not mention any of the entities related to Busba Kitiyakara.

Context idx 5 ("Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"): This context is relevant because it discusses the film "Ae Dil Hai Mushkil" and its director Karan Johar, but it does not mention his father, making it less relevant than context idx 1. 3. Context idx 0 ("Tushar Kalia"): This context mentions Karan Johar in relation to the film "Ae Dil Hai Mushkil", but like context idx 5, it does not mention his father. It is relevant due to the association with Karan Johar and the film. 4. Context idx 9 ("Amit Mishra (singer)"): This context is the least relevant as it focuses on Amit Mishra and his work related to the film's soundtrack, without any mention of Karan Johar's father.

Question:Who was born first out of Ramsay Anderson and Fernand Fédronic?
golden idx: [5, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Ramsay Anderson and Fernand Fédronic, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provide the necessary dates: Ramsay Anderson was born on 2 May 1888, and Fernand Fédronic was born on 21 December 1964. Therefore, the contexts that directly mention these individuals and their birth dates are most relevant.

1. "Ramsay Anderson" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Ramsay Anderson and his date of birth, which is crucial for answering the claim.
2. "Fernand Fédronic" context: This context is equally important because it provides the exact date of birth for Fernand Fédronic, allowing us to compare the two dates.
3. "Henry Moore (cricketer)" context: Although this context mentions a date of birth, it is not related to the individuals in question and therefore is less relevant.
4. "Wesley Barresi" context: Similar to the previous context, it provides a date of birth but for a different individual, making it less relevant.
5. "Tom Dickinson" context: This context also mentions a date of birth and details about the individual's life, but again, it is not related to the claim.
6. "John Allen (Oxford University cricketer)" context: It provides information about another individual's birth date, which is not relevant to the claim.
7. "John McMahon (Surrey and Somerset cricketer)" context: This context is informative about another person's life but does not help answer the claim.
8. "Hartley Lobban" context: It mentions a birth date but is unrelated to the claim.

The remaining contexts do not mention any dates of birth or relevant individuals and are therefore not included in the ranking.

idx: [7, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Ramsay Anderson and Fernand Fédronic, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provided are 'Ramsay Anderson date of birth 2 May 1888' and 'Fernand Fédronic date of birth 21 December 1964'. 

1. Context idx 7 titled 'Ramsay Anderson' directly matches the first reasoning step, providing the exact date of birth for Ramsay Anderson, which is crucial for answering the claim.
2. Context idx 5 titled 'Fernand Fédronic' directly matches the second reasoning step, providing the exact date of birth for Fernand Fédronic, which is also crucial for answering the claim.
3. The other contexts (idx 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9) are about different individuals and do not provide information relevant to the claim about the birth dates of Ramsay Anderson and Fernand Fédronic.

Therefore, the contexts that are most relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim are those that match the reasoning steps and provide the specific information needed to determine who was born first.

idx: [7, 5, 1, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Ramsay Anderson" context: It directly relates to the claim as it mentions Ramsay Anderson and provides his exact date of birth, which is crucial for determining who was born first. 2. "Fernand Fédronic" context: This context directly mentions Fernand Fédronic and provides his date of birth, which is necessary to compare with Ramsay Anderson's date of birth to answer the claim. 3. "Henry Moore (cricketer)" context: Although it provides a date of birth, it is not relevant to the claim since it does not pertain to either of the individuals in question. 4. "Wesley Barresi" context: Similar to the Henry Moore context, it provides a date of birth but is not relevant to the claim about Ramsay Anderson and Fernand Fédronic.

step-by-step think: The claim is about identifying the spouse of John Farrow, the director of the film "West of Shanghai." The reasoning steps provided are 'West of Shanghai director John Farrow' and "John Farrow spouse Maureen O'Sullivan." Based on these, the contexts should be ranked as follows:

1. Context 0: This context is directly relevant as it mentions John Farrow and his spouse, Maureen O'Sullivan, which is the exact answer to the claim.
2. Context 1: This context is relevant as it mentions the film "West of Shanghai" and John Farrow as the director, which is part of the reasoning steps.
3. Contexts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9: These contexts mention various individuals and their spouses, but they are not relevant to the claim about John Farrow and "West of Shanghai."

Therefore, the contexts should be ranked with context 0 as the highest scoring context because it directly answers the claim, followed by context 1 which is related to the film directed by John Farrow. The rest of the contexts do not contribute to answering the claim and are thus ranked lower.

idx: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 1. Context 0: This context is directly relevant as it mentions John Farrow and his spouse Maureen O'Sullivan, which matches perfectly with the reasoning steps. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context 1: This context mentions 'West of Shanghai' and John Farrow, which are relevant to the reasoning steps. However, it does not mention his spouse, making it slightly less relevant than context 0. 3. Context 6: This context is about Mehdi Abrishamchi and mentions a spouse relationship, but it is not related to John Farrow or 'West of Shanghai'. It is less relevant than contexts 0 and 1. 4. Context 5: This context mentions Maria Teresa as a spouse, but it is not related to John Farrow or the film. It is informative but less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous contexts.
idx: [0, 1, 6, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "John Farrow" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions John Farrow and provides information about his spouse, Maureen O'Sullivan, which directly answers the claim. 2. "West of Shanghai" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the film directed by John Farrow, but it does not provide information about his spouse. However, it is still related to the first reasoning step. 3. "Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg" context: This context mentions a spouse, but it is not related to John Farrow or the film "West of Shanghai". It is less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. "Mehdi Abrishamchi" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention John Farrow, the film "West of Shanghai", or Maureen O'Sullivan.

Question:Which film was released earlier, Amelie Or The Time To Love or Beginners?
golden idx: [7, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well the context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 1. "Amelie or The Time to Love" context: This context directly relates to the claim and provides the publication date of the film, which is crucial for answering the question. 2. "Beginners" context: This context is also directly related to the claim and provides the publication date of the film. 3. "Time to Love" context: While this context has a similar title to one of the films in question, it does not provide specific information about the publication date, making it less relevant. 4. "A Time to Live and a Time to Love" context: This context is somewhat related because of the similar title, but it refers to a different film and thus is less relevant. 5-8. The remaining contexts ("For Love or Money," "To Love," "Return to Love," "Back to Love," "The Game of Love," "Colour of Love") do not directly relate to the films in question and are therefore ranked lower.
idx: [8, 7, 5, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3]

step-by-step think: To determine which film was released earlier, 'Amelie or The Time to Love' or 'Beginners', we need to compare their publication dates. The reasoning steps provided are 'Amelie or The Time to Love publication date 1961' and 'Beginners publication date 2010'. 

1. Context idx 8 ('Amelie or The Time to Love'): This context is highly relevant as it matches the title 'Amelie or The Time to Love' and confirms the publication date of 1961, which is directly related to the claim.
2. Context idx 7 ('Beginners'): This context is also highly relevant as it matches the title 'Beginners' and confirms the publication date of 2010, which is necessary to answer the claim.
3. Context idx 9 ('A Time to Live and a Time to Love'): This context is less relevant because it refers to a different film with a similar name but a different publication date (1976), which could cause confusion.
4. Context idx 5 ('Time to Love'): This context is not directly relevant as it does not provide a specific publication date or detailed information about the film in question.

The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not match the titles of the films being compared or provide any publication dates.

idx: [8, 7, 9, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Amelie or The Time to Love" context: This context directly relates to the claim and provides the publication date of 1961, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Beginners" context: This context also directly relates to the claim and provides the publication date of 2010, matching the other reasoning step. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "A Time to Live and a Time to Love" context: Although this context has a similar title, it refers to a different film released in 1976 and does not match the reasoning steps as closely as the first two contexts. It is less relevant to the claim. 4. "Time to Love" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not provide a specific publication date or detailed information about a particular film, making it unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:What is the cause of death of composer of song Look At Me (Xxxtentacion Song)?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To address the claim regarding the cause of death of the composer of the song "Look At Me" by XXXTentacion, we need to identify contexts that mention XXXTentacion and provide information about his death. The reasoning steps guide us to look for contexts that mention XXXTentacion being shot as the cause of death. 

1. Context 4 is the most relevant as it directly mentions XXXTentacion and details his death, including the cause, which was being shot.
2. Context 6 is relevant because it discusses the song "Look at Me" by XXXTentacion, which is directly related to the claim.
3. Context 2 mentions a composer and death, but it is about Alonso Mudarra, not XXXTentacion, so it is less relevant.
4. Context 5 mentions a composer, Walter Robinson, but does not relate to XXXTentacion or his death.
5. Context 7 discusses Alexander Courage, a composer, but again, it is not related to XXXTentacion.
6. Context 1 is about Alonso Mudarra, a composer who is not related to the claim.
7. Context 0 mentions Lamman Rucker, an actor with no connection to XXXTentacion or the claim.
8. Context 3 is about a song titled "Look at Me Now," which could be confused with "Look at Me" by XXXTentacion, but it is a different song and artist.
9. Context 8 is about Paco Boublard, an actor and photographer, with no relevant information about XXXTentacion's death.
10. Context 9 is about the song "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)" by Phil Collins, which is not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the top 8 ranked contexts are:

idx: [4, 6, 2, 5, 7, 1, 3, 0]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it mentions XXXTentacion and directly addresses the cause of death, which is central to the claim. 2. Context idx 6: This context is about the song "Look at Me" by XXXTentacion, which is related to the claim but does not mention his cause of death. 3. Context idx 2: This context is about a different "Look at Me" song and is not relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 5: This context is about a different composer and is not relevant to the claim. 5. Context idx 7: This context is about a different composer and is not relevant to the claim. 6. Context idx 1: This context is about a different composer and is not relevant to the claim. 7.

idx: [4, 6, 2, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the cause of death of XXXTentacion, the composer of the song "Look At Me". The reasoning steps provided are 'Look at Me! composer XXXTentacion' and 'XXXTentacion cause of death shot'. Based on these, I will rank the contexts as follows:
1. Context idx 4: This context is directly related to XXXTentacion and mentions his cause of death as being shot, which matches perfectly with the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and informative regarding the claim.
2. Context idx 6: This context is about the song "Look at Me" by XXXTentacion. While it does not mention his cause of death, it is relevant to the claim as it pertains to the composer and the song mentioned in the reasoning steps.
3. Context idx 2: This context is about a different song titled "Look at Me" by John Lennon. It is not relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps as it does not pertain to XXXTentacion.
4. Context idx 5: This context is about Walter Robinson, a composer who is not related to the claim or the reasoning steps. It is the least relevant context.

Based on the rules for ranking, the top 3 contexts in order of relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim are:

Question:Where was the place of burial of Meritites I's husband?
golden idx: [0, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the burial place of Meritites I's husband, Khufu. The reasoning steps provided are 'Meritites I spouse Khufu' and 'Khufu place of burial Great Pyramid of Giza'. Therefore, the contexts that mention Meritites I, Khufu, and the Great Pyramid of Giza are most relevant. 

1. Context idx 8 ('Khufu') is the most relevant as it directly mentions Khufu and the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is his place of burial.
2. Context idx 0 ('Meritites I') is highly relevant because it discusses Meritites I and her relationship with Khufu, although it does not mention his burial place.
3. Context idx 9 ('Meritites II') is somewhat relevant because it mentions Meritites I and Khufu, but like context idx 0, it does not mention the burial place.

Question:Why did the performer of song Ludlow Massacre (Song) die?
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 
1. Context 3 ("Ludlow Massacre (song)"): This context is directly related to the song "Ludlow Massacre" and mentions Woody Guthrie, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 1 ("Mary Thomas O'Neal"): This context mentions the Ludlow Massacre, which is related to the song performed by Woody Guthrie, making it somewhat relevant.
3. Context 3 ("Woody Guthrie"): This context provides detailed information about Woody Guthrie, including his cause of death, which is Huntington's disease, directly answering the claim.
4. Context 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Woody Guthrie or the song "Ludlow Massacre."
5. Context 0 ("Lamman Rucker"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Woody Guthrie or the song "Ludlow Massacre."

Based on the above considerations, the contexts are ranked as follows:
idx: [3, 2, 1, 0, 4, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about Woody Guthrie's death and the presence of information related to the reasoning steps. 1. Context 3 ("Woody Guthrie"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Woody Guthrie and provides detailed information about his life, including his cause of death, which is Huntington's disease. It matches both reasoning steps and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context 2 ("Ludlow Massacre (song)"): This context is relevant because it mentions the song "Ludlow Massacre" performed by Woody Guthrie. However, it does not provide information about his death, making it less relevant than context 3. 3. Context 1 ("Mary Thomas O'Neal"): This context is related to the Ludlow Massacre but does not mention Woody Guthrie or his cause of death, so it is less relevant than contexts 3 and 2. 4. Context 0 ("Lamman Rucker"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Woody Guthrie or the Ludlow Massacre. It is the least likely to contain the answer to the claim among the top four contexts.
idx: [3, 2, 1, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "Woody Guthrie" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Woody Guthrie and provides detailed information about his life, including his cause of death, which is Huntington's disease. This matches perfectly with the reasoning steps and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Ludlow Massacre (song)" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the song "Ludlow Massacre" performed by Woody Guthrie. However, it does not provide information about his death, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the "Woody Guthrie" context. 3. "Mary Thomas O'Neal" context: This context is related to the Ludlow Massacre but does not mention Woody Guthrie or his cause of death. It is less relevant than the previous contexts but more so than the "Lamman Rucker" context, which is unrelated. 4. "Lamman Rucker" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Woody Guthrie, the Ludlow Massacre, or any related information. It is the least likely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:Where was the director of film Slingshot (Film) born?
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the birthplace of Jay Alaimo, the director of the film "Slingshot." The reasoning steps provided are 'Slingshot director Jay Alaimo' and 'Jay Alaimo place of birth Suffield, Connecticut.' Based on these, I will rank the contexts as follows:

1. Context idx 0: This context is titled 'Jay Alaimo' and the paragraph text directly mentions that Jay Alaimo was born in Suffield, Connecticut. It matches perfectly with the reasoning steps and is highly relevant to the claim.
2. Context idx 2: The title 'Slingshot (film)' is directly related to the claim since it's the film directed by Jay Alaimo. The paragraph text mentions Jay Alaimo as the director, making it relevant.
3. Context idx 9: The title 'Jackie Salloum' is not directly related, but the paragraph text mentions the film "Slingshot Hip Hop," which could be confused with "Slingshot (Film)." It's less relevant than the first two but still has a connection to the claim.
4. Context idx 3: The title 'Brian Kennedy (gallery director)' is not directly related, but it mentions a director's birthplace, which is relevant to the claim about a director's birthplace.
5. Context idx 4: The title 'Olav Aaraas' is not directly related, but it mentions a director's birthplace, which is relevant to the claim about a director's birthplace.

8. Context idx 6: The title 'Jesse E. Hobson' mentions a director, which is somewhat relevant since the claim is about a director.

The remaining contexts (idx 1 and idx 8) are not related to the claim or the reasoning steps and therefore are not included in the top 8.

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 0: This context directly mentions Jay Alaimo and his place of birth, Suffield, Connecticut, which is exactly the information needed to answer the claim. 2. Context idx 2: This context mentions "Slingshot" and Jay Alaimo as the director, which is relevant but does not provide information about his birthplace. 3. Context idx 9: This context is about a different film called "Slingshot Hip Hop" and a different director, which might confuse with the claim but is less relevant. 4. Context idx 3: This context talks about a gallery director's birthplace, which is not directly related to the claim but shows a pattern of providing birthplace information for directors.
idx: [0, 2, 9, 3]

step-by-step think: 1.

It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

However, it does not mention his place of birth. 3.

Context with index 3: This context is about Brian Kennedy, a gallery director, and has no direct relevance to Jay Alaimo or the film "Slingshot."

Context idx 8: This context mentions "Coal City station" in Illinois, which is indirectly related to "Coal City, Illinois." 5. Context idx 9: This context talks about "Coal City High School" in Illinois, which is indirectly related to "Coal City, Illinois." 6.

Context idx 3: This context mentions "Bluff City, Illinois," which is not directly related but is in the same state as "Coal City, Illinois."
idx: [5, 0, 1, 8, 9, 2, 4, 3]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the location of Coal City, Illinois and Lash Kenar, Nur, and whether they are in the same country. The reasoning steps provided are 'Coal City, Illinois country U.S.' and 'Lash Kenar, Nur country Iran'. Based on these steps:
1. Context idx 5 ("Coal City, Illinois") is highly relevant as it confirms the location of Coal City in the U.S.
2. Context idx 0 ("Lash Kenar, Nur") is equally relevant as it confirms the location of Lash Kenar in Iran.
3. Context idx 8 ("Coal City station") is relevant as it provides additional information about Coal City, Illinois, but does not directly address the country.
4. Context idx 9 ("Coal City High School") is informative about Coal City, Illinois, but like idx 8, it does not directly address the country.
The contexts idx 1, 2, 3, and 4 are less relevant as they do not provide direct information about the countries of the locations in question.
idx: [5, 0, 8, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim involves determining whether Coal City, Illinois and Lash Kenar, Nur are in the same country. The reasoning steps provided are 'Coal City, Illinois country U.S.' and 'Lash Kenar, Nur country Iran'. 1.

Context idx 1: This context mentions Susan Moody, who became the stepmother of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark after marrying John Dalgleish Donaldson. It is included because of the connection to Danish royalty, which is tangentially related to the claim, but it is the least likely to contain the answer.

"Dat Whoopty Woop" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different album and does not provide information about the albums in question. 6.

idx: [5,7]

step-by-step think: To determine which album came out earlier, 'Was I the Wave?' or 'Kingdom of Rock', we need to compare their publication dates. The reasoning steps provided are 'Was I the Wave? publication date April 26, 2011' and 'Kingdom of Rock publication date 6 November 2015'. Therefore, we will rank the contexts based on how well they match these entities and dates.

1. Context idx 5: This context directly mentions 'Was I the Wave?' and provides the exact publication date as stated in the reasoning steps, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 7: This context directly mentions 'Kingdom of Rock' and provides the exact publication date as stated in the reasoning steps, making it equally relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 2: This context mentions an album and its release date, but it is not related to the albums in question. It is less relevant than contexts 5 and 7.
4. Context idx 3: Similar to context 2, this context mentions an album and its release date, but it is not related to the albums in question. It is less relevant than contexts 5 and 7.
5. Context idx 1: This context mentions an album and its release date, but it is not related to the albums in question. It is less relevant than contexts 5 and 7.
6. Context idx 8: This context mentions an album and its release date, but it is not related to the albums in question. It is less relevant than contexts 5 and 7.
7. Context idx 6: This context mentions an album and its release date, but it is not related to the albums in question. It is less relevant than contexts 5 and 7.
8. Context idx 0: This context mentions a series of albums and their release dates, but it is not related to the albums in question. It is less relevant than contexts 5 and 7.

The remaining contexts do not mention any albums or release dates and are therefore not relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [0, 3]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the dates of death of Olaf Everson and Abdul Wahab Khan Tarzi. The reasoning steps provided are the dates of death for both individuals. Therefore, the contexts that directly mention these dates will be ranked highest. 1. "Olaf Everson" context: It matches one of the reasoning steps exactly, providing the date of death for Olaf Everson. 2. "Abdul Wahab Khan Tarzi" context: It matches the other reasoning step exactly, providing the date of death for Abdul Wahab Khan Tarzi.

It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Abdul Wahab Khan Tarzi" context: This context directly relates to the claim as it mentions Abdul Wahab Khan Tarzi and provides the exact date of death, which is one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Abdul Wahab (journalist)" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions a different Abdul Wahab, but it still provides a date of death in 1994, which could be confused with Abdul Wahab Khan Tarzi. 4. "Afif Abdul Wahab" context: This context is relevant as it provides a date of death, but it is for a different individual and thus is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention the individuals in question.
idx: [0, 3, 4, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Abdul Wahab Khan Tarzi" context: This context directly relates to the claim and provides the exact date of death for Abdul Wahab Khan Tarzi, which is crucial for determining who died first.

Question:Who died later, Stephen De Staebler or Samuel Arthur Saunder?
golden idx: [7, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine who died later between Stephen De Staebler and Samuel Arthur Saunder, I will rank the contexts based on the provided reasoning steps which include their dates of death. Contexts that mention the individuals and their dates of death will be ranked higher.

1. Context 9 (Stephen De Staebler): This context directly mentions Stephen De Staebler and his date of death, May 13, 2011, which is essential for answering the claim.
2. Context 7 (Samuel Arthur Saunder): This context directly mentions Samuel Arthur Saunder and his date of death, December 8, 1912, which is essential for answering the claim.
3. Context 8 (Robert David Brady): This context mentions Stephen De Staebler, which is relevant to the claim, but does not mention his date of death.
4. Context 4 (Mike De Placido): This context mentions a person with a similar name to Stephen De Staebler, but it is not relevant to the claim.

8. Context 6 (Samuel Gunton): This context mentions a person with a similar name to Samuel Arthur Saunder, but it is not relevant to the claim.

The remaining contexts do not mention either individual or relevant information related to the claim and are therefore not included in the ranking.

idx: [9, 7, 8, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine who died later between Stephen De Staebler and Samuel Arthur Saunder, we need to compare the dates of death provided in the reasoning steps. The reasoning steps indicate that Stephen De Staebler died on May 13, 2011, and Samuel Arthur Saunder died on December 8, 1912. Therefore, Stephen De Staebler died later than Samuel Arthur Saunder. Now, to rank the contexts, we need to consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps and how relevant and informative they are to the claim.

1. Context idx 9 ("Stephen De Staebler"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Stephen De Staebler and his date of death, which is one of the key pieces of information needed to answer the claim.
2. Context idx 7 ("Samuel Arthur Saunder"): This context is also highly relevant because it provides the date of death for Samuel Arthur Saunder, which is the other critical piece of information for the claim.
3. Context idx 8 ("Robert David Brady"): This context mentions Stephen De Staebler, making it somewhat relevant, but it does not provide information on the dates of death, so it is less useful for answering the claim.
4. Context idx 3 ("Sam Bohne"): This context is not directly relevant to the claim as it discusses a different Samuel Arthur, but it is included because it mentions a date of death, which is a relevant concept for the claim.

The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the individuals in question or provide information about their dates of death.

idx: [9, 7, 8, 3]

step-by-step think: The claim is about determining who died later between Stephen De Staebler and Samuel Arthur Saunder. The reasoning steps provided are the dates of death for both individuals. 1. Context 9 ("Stephen De Staebler") is highly relevant as it directly mentions Stephen De Staebler and his date of death, which is one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context 7 ("Samuel Arthur Saunder") is equally relevant because it provides the date of death for Samuel Arthur Saunder, addressing the other half of the reasoning steps. 3. Context 8 ("Robert David Brady") mentions Stephen De Staebler but does not provide information on the claim's focus, which is the comparative dates of death. 4. Context 3 ("Sam Bohne") is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either of the individuals in question or their dates of death.

idx: [3, 0, 6, 7, 1, 2, 4, 5]

step-by-step think:1. Context with index 3 ("Sergio Osmeña"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Sergio Osmeña and provides extensive information about his life, including his political career and family. Most importantly, it states that he served as Governor of Cebu, which directly answers the claim regarding his place of birth. 2. Context with index 0 ("Esperanza Osmeña"): This context is relevant because it mentions Esperanza Osmeña, the spouse of Sergio Osmeña. However, it does not provide information about Sergio Osmeña's place of birth. 3. The remaining contexts (indices 6, 7, 1, 2, 4, 5) are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Sergio Osmeña or his place of birth. They are about different individuals and their spouses, which are unrelated to the claim.
idx: [3, 0, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with index 3 titled "Sergio Osmeña" is the most relevant as it provides detailed information about Sergio Osmeña, including his place of birth, which is Cebu. This context matches perfectly with the reasoning steps and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context with index 0 titled "Esperanza Osmeña" is relevant because it mentions Esperanza Osmeña, who is connected to Sergio Osmeña. However, it does not provide information about Sergio Osmeña's place of birth, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to context 3. 3. Contexts with index 6 and 7 are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Sergio Osmeña or his place of birth. Between the two, context 6 is slightly more relevant because it discusses the spouse of a political figure, but it is still not likely to contain the answer to the claim.

golden idx: [4, 5]
step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandmother of Sudeley Hanbury-Tracy, 3rd Baron Sudeley, we need to identify the mother of his father, Thomas Hanbury-Tracy, 2nd Baron Sudeley.

Context 7 mentions Henry Hanbury-Tracy, a relative, which could provide additional family information. Context 0 mentions Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 1st Baron Sudeley, who is the grandfather, and thus his spouse would be the grandmother in question. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the immediate family members related to the claim.

Question:Which album was released more recently, The Arockalypse or Because The Internet?
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: To determine which album was released more recently, 'The Arockalypse' or 'Because the Internet', I will rank the contexts based on the publication dates mentioned in the reasoning steps. The context that directly mentions 'Because the Internet' with its release date of 2013 will be ranked highest, followed by the context that mentions 'The Arockalypse' with its release date. Other contexts will be ranked based on their relevance to the albums in question.

1. Context idx 0: Directly mentions 'Because the Internet' and its release date in 2013, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 2: Directly mentions 'The Arockalypse' but does not provide a specific release date, yet it is relevant due to the album title.
3. Context idx 9: Mentions 'The Arockalypse' and the year 2006, which is relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 1: Mentions 'The Arockalypse' in the context of a single from the album, which is relevant but less informative about the album's release date.
5. Context idx 7: Mentions 'Icon', an album released in August 2013, which is close to the release date of 'Because the Internet', but not directly related to the claim.

7. Context idx 5: Mentions an album released in 2005, which is before both albums in question, providing some context for the timeline.
8. Context idx 4: Mentions an album with no direct relation to the claim but provides a sense of the timeline of album releases.

The remaining contexts are not directly related to the albums in question and therefore are not ranked within the top 8.

idx: [0, 2, 9, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4]

step-by-step think: The task is to determine which album, "The Arockalypse" or "Because the Internet," was released more recently. The reasoning steps provided are the publication dates of both albums: "The Arockalypse" in 2006 and "Because the Internet" in 2013. Therefore, the contexts need to be ranked based on how well they match these entities and dates, their relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer.

1. Context idx 0 ("Because the Internet"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the album "Because the Internet" and its release date, December 10, 2013, which matches one of the reasoning steps. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.

2. Context idx 2 ("The Arockalypse"): This context is also highly relevant as it directly mentions the album "The Arockalypse" and relates to the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, indicating its time frame. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.

3. Context idx 9 ("Who's Your Daddy? (Lordi song)"): This context is relevant as it mentions the song "Who's Your Daddy?" from the album "The Arockalypse" and the year 2006, which is related to the claim.

4. Context idx 1 ("It Snows in Hell"): This context is relevant because it mentions the album "The Arockalypse" and provides additional information about one of its singles and its release format, which may indirectly help to confirm the album's release date.

The other contexts are about different albums and artists and do not directly relate to the claim or the reasoning steps provided.

idx: [0, 2, 9, 1]

step-by-step think: To determine which album was released more recently, 'The Arockalypse' or 'Because the Internet', we need to compare their publication dates. The reasoning steps provided are 'The Arockalypse publication date 2006' and 'Because the Internet publication date 2013'. Based on these dates, 'Because the Internet' is the more recent album. Now, to rank the contexts:
1. Context idx 0 ('Because the Internet'): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the album 'Because the Internet' and provides the specific release date, which is crucial for answering the claim.
2. Context idx 2 ('The Arockalypse'): This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions the album 'The Arockalypse' and is associated with the reasoning step regarding its publication date.

Context idx 4: This context discusses the musical "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," which is the basis for the film. It is relevant due to its close association with the film, but less directly related to the claim compared to the contexts that explicitly mention the films' countries of origin.

The "Music in Darkness" context is also highly relevant because it mentions the film directed by Bergman, which is part of the claim. The other contexts do not mention Bergman or Fårö and are therefore less relevant to the claim.
idx: [0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context 0 ("Ingmar Bergman"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Ingmar Bergman extensively, including his work and life. It also specifically mentions the island of Fårö, which is directly related to the reasoning step regarding Bergman's place of death. 2. Context 3 ("Music in Darkness"): This context is relevant because it mentions the film "Music in Darkness" directed by Ingmar Bergman. However, it does not provide information about Bergman's death, making it less relevant than context 0. 3.

However, it does not provide information about his death, making it less relevant than context 0. 3. Context 7: This context is about a different film with a similar title and does not mention Ingmar Bergman or his place of death, making it the least relevant. 4.

Question:Which country Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620–1659)'s father is from?
golden idx: [1, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 
1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Stanisław Koniecpolski and provides detailed information about his life and achievements, including his role in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
2. Context idx 5: This context directly relates to Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620–1659) and mentions his father, Stanisław Koniecpolski, which is crucial for answering the claim.

4. Context idx 2: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different person named Aleksander, but it is still informative and related to Poland.
5. Context idx 4: This context is not directly relevant to the claim but provides information about a political figure from Kazakhstan, which might be useful for comparative purposes.
6. Context idx 7: This context is informative but not directly relevant to the claim as it discusses an individual with Italian and Argentine nationality.

It mentions his role in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which is the country of citizenship we're looking for. 2. Context idx 5: This context is about Aleksander Koniecpolski and mentions his father, Stanisław Koniecpolski, making it relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention Stanisław's country of citizenship directly. 3. Context idx 0: This context mentions another Aleksander Koniecpolski and his father, Stanisław Przedbór Koniecpolski, which could cause confusion but is less relevant as it does not pertain to the correct individuals related to the claim. 4. Context idx 7: This context is not directly related to the claim but is included because it mentions a person with multiple nationalities, which is a less relevant match to the 'country of citizenship' aspect of the reasoning steps.
idx: [1, 5, 0, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context 1 titled 'Stanisław Koniecpolski' is the most relevant as it directly mentions Stanisław Koniecpolski and provides extensive information about his life and roles within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which is directly related to the reasoning steps. 2.

Question:Who is Archibald Acheson, 4Th Earl Of Gosford's paternal grandfather?
golden idx: [2, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandfather of Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford, we need to identify the contexts that mention his father and grandfather. The reasoning steps provided indicate that Archibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford is his father, and Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford is his grandfather. Therefore, the contexts that mention these individuals are most relevant to the claim.
1. Context idx 4: This context is about Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford, who is the paternal grandfather of the 4th Earl of Gosford. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 2: This context discusses Archibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford, the father of the 4th Earl of Gosford. It is relevant as it provides information about the immediate family.
3. Context idx 7: This context is about Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford himself. It is relevant as it may contain information about his family lineage.
4. Context idx 8: This context mentions Sir Archibald Acheson, 1st Baronet, who could be a relative and thus potentially relevant to the family history.
5. Context idx 3: This context is less relevant as it discusses Thomas Stewart, Master of Mar, and does not mention the Acheson family.
6. Context idx 1: This context is about Gilbert Talbot, 3rd Baron Talbot, and is not directly relevant to the Acheson family.
7. Context idx 5: This context discusses John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland, and is not directly relevant to the claim.
8. Context idx 6: This context is about Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery, and is not directly relevant to the claim.
The remaining contexts (idx 0 and idx 9) do not mention the Acheson family and are therefore not relevant to the claim.
idx: [4,2,7,8,3,1,5,6]

step-by-step think: To determine the paternal grandfather of Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford, we need to trace back two generations from the 4th Earl. The reasoning steps provided indicate that the 4th Earl's father is Archibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford, and the 3rd Earl's father is Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford. Therefore, the 2nd Earl of Gosford is the paternal grandfather of the 4th Earl. 
1. Context idx 4: This context is about Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford, who is the paternal grandfather of the 4th Earl. It directly matches the entities in the reasoning steps and is highly relevant to the claim.
2. Context idx 2: This context provides information about Archibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford, the father of the 4th Earl. It is relevant as it connects the 4th Earl to his grandfather.
3. Context idx 7: This context discusses Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford, the subject of the claim. It is relevant but does not directly answer the question about the paternal grandfather.
4. Context idx 8: This context is about Sir Archibald Acheson, 1st Baronet, who is not directly related to the claim but shares the Acheson surname, which may be of interest for historical context.
The other contexts (idx 3, 1, 5, 6) are not relevant to the Acheson lineage and therefore score lower.
idx: [4, 2, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: The claim requires identifying the paternal grandfather of Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford. According to the reasoning steps, his father is Archibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford, and his grandfather is Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford. Therefore, the context that mentions the 2nd Earl of Gosford is most relevant. 1. Context idx 4: This context is about Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford, who is the paternal grandfather of the 4th Earl of Gosford, making it the most relevant and likely to contain the answer. 2. Context idx 2: This context is about Archibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford, the father of the 4th Earl, and is the second most relevant. 3. Context idx 7: This context is about the 4th Earl himself, which is less relevant than the contexts about his ancestors but still related to the claim. Context idx 8 is about the 1st Baronet, who is not mentioned in the reasoning steps and is thus the least relevant.

The reasoning steps indicate that 'The First Seven Years' was published in 1930 and 'Cinesound Varieties' in 1934. Therefore, 'Cinesound Varieties' is the more recent film. Now, we need to rank the contexts based on how well they match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, their relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 1 ('Cinesound Varieties'): This context is directly relevant as it mentions 'Cinesound Varieties' and its publication date, which is crucial for answering the claim.
2. Context idx 6 ('The First Seven Years'): This context is also directly relevant as it mentions 'The First Seven Years' and its publication date.

idx: [1, 6, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Cinesound Varieties" context: This context is highly relevant as it matches the title mentioned in the reasoning steps and provides the exact publication date, 1934, which is crucial for answering the claim. 2. "The First Seven Years" context: This context is also highly relevant because it matches the other title mentioned in the reasoning steps and provides the publication date, 1930, necessary for the comparison. 3. "Rakka (film)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a film released in 2017, which is not one of the films in question. 4. "Coney Island Baby (film)" context: This context is informative but not relevant to the claim since it discusses a different film released in 2003. 5.

"Coney Island Baby (film)" context: Although this context is about a film, it is not relevant to the claim since it does not match the entities or the publication dates mentioned in the reasoning steps. 4. "Invasion of the Neptune Men" context: This context is the least relevant as it neither matches the entities from the reasoning steps nor provides any useful information regarding the publication dates of the films in question.

golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about the place of death of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, we need to find contexts that mention him and his place of death. 1. Context 3 is the most relevant as it directly mentions William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey and his title, which is closely related to the claim. 2. Context 2 is the second most relevant because it mentions William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, who is the son of the 1st Earl, and thus directly related to the claim. 3. Context 4 is relevant as it mentions William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, and Lewes, which is the place of death according to the reasoning steps. 4. Context 1 mentions William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey, who is related to the 1st Earl by family lineage. 5. Context 5 mentions Ada de Warenne, a relative of the 1st Earl, which could provide context to the family and potentially the place of death. 6. Context 9 mentions William Peverel the Younger, who is connected to the Warenne family through marriage, which could provide indirect information related to the claim. 7. Context 6 mentions William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, who is part of the same lineage and may provide some relevant family background. 8. Context 0 mentions William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey, but does not provide direct information about the 1st Earl's place of death; however, it is still more relevant than the remaining contexts.

step-by-step think: The claim is about the place of death of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, who is the father of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey. The reasoning steps provided are: 'William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey father William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey', 'William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey place of death Lewes'. Based on these steps, I will rank the contexts as follows:

2. Context idx 2: This context mentions William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey and his relation to the 1st Earl of Surrey. It is relevant because it establishes the relationship between the two but does not mention the place of death.
3. Context idx 5: This context is about William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, and while it provides extensive information about the family and their titles, it does not directly address the place of death of the 1st Earl of Surrey. However, it is still somewhat relevant due to the family connection.
4. Context idx 1: This context is about Waleran de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Warwick, who is related to the Warenne family through Gundred de Warenne. It is the least relevant to the claim as it does not mention the place of death or provide direct information about the 1st Earl of Surrey.

The claim is about the release dates of two films, "Royal Treasure" and "When Love Begins." The reasoning steps provided are 'Royal Treasure publication date 2016' and 'When Love Begins publication date 2008'.

1. Context idx 2 ("Royal Treasure"): This context is directly relevant as it mentions the film "Royal Treasure" and its release date in 2016, matching one of the reasoning steps.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the reasoning steps, the contexts are ranked with the most relevant and informative contexts first, which are likely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [2, 8, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine which film was released more recently, we need to compare the publication dates provided in the reasoning steps. The reasoning steps indicate that 'Royal Treasure' was published in 2016 and 'When Love Begins' was published in 2008. Therefore, we will rank the contexts based on how well they match these publication dates and their relevance to the claim.
1. Context idx 2 ('Royal Treasure'): This context is the most relevant as it directly matches the 'Royal Treasure publication date 2016' reasoning step and confirms the film was released on January 15, 2016.
2. Context idx 8 ('When Love Begins'): This context is the second most relevant as it directly matches the 'When Love Begins publication date 2008' reasoning step and confirms the film was released by Star Cinema.
3. Context idx 0 ('The Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio'): This context is less relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film released in 2009, which is not part of the reasoning steps.
4. Context idx 1 ('When Love Comes Along'): This context is also less relevant as it discusses a film from 1998, which is not part of the reasoning steps but is still about a film's release date.
The remaining contexts are not directly related to the films in question and therefore score lower in relevance to the claim.
idx: [2, 8, 0, 1]

step-by-step think:1. "Royal Treasure" context: This context directly matches the reasoning step mentioning "Royal Treasure publication date 2016" and provides the exact release date, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "When Love Begins" context: This context also matches the reasoning step "When Love Begins publication date 2008" and confirms the release year of the film, making it relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "The Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio" context: Although this context provides a release date for a different film, it is less relevant because it does not match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps related to the claim. 4. "When Love Comes Along" context: This context is about a different film with a similar title but is not relevant to the claim as it does not match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.

step-by-step think: The claim requires identifying the paternal grandfather of Albert IV, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. According to the reasoning steps, we need to find the father of John II, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, who is also the father of Albert IV. Therefore, the context that mentions John II and his father will be most relevant. 1.

Context idx 8 "Sebastián Borensztein": This context is equally relevant because it provides the exact date of birth for Sebastián Borensztein, allowing for a direct comparison with Ela Gandhi's birth date. 3. Context idx 4 "Kasturba Gandhi": While this context is about a different Gandhi, it is somewhat relevant because it pertains to the Gandhi family and could potentially lead to confusion or be informative about the family lineage. 4. Context idx 1 "Aminatou Haidar": This context is less relevant to the claim but is included because it mentions a nickname related to the Gandhi family, which could be misleading or informative in a broader search related to the Gandhi family.

step-by-step think:1. "Ela Gandhi" context: This context directly mentions Ela Gandhi and provides her exact date of birth, which is essential to address the claim. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Sebastián Borensztein" context: This context directly mentions Sebastián Borensztein and provides his exact date of birth. It is equally relevant to the claim and contains the necessary information to answer the question. 3. "Kasturba Gandhi" context: Although this context is about a different Gandhi, it is less relevant because it does not pertain to the claim about Ela Gandhi or Sebastián Borensztein. However, it is more relevant than the "Aminatou Haidar" context because it mentions a family member related to Ela Gandhi. 4. "Aminatou Haidar" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention either Ela Gandhi or Sebastián Borensztein and is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

golden idx: [2, 4]
step-by-step think: The task is to rank the contexts based on how well they match the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim about which film was released first. 1. Context idx 4: This context directly mentions "Uzhaikkum Karangal" and provides the publication date of 1976, which is one of the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 2: This context directly mentions "The Cemetery Club" and provides the publication date of 1993, which is the other reasoning step. It is also highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 0: This context mentions "The Cemetery Club" but refers to a 2006 film, which might confuse with the 1993 film. It is less relevant than the previous contexts but still contains useful information. 4. Context idx 1: This context mentions "The Cemetery Club" in relation to a cemetery, not the film, making it less relevant. 5. Context idx 3: This context is about an "Old Jewish cemetery" and does not relate to the claim. 6. Context idx 7: This context is about "Linwood Cemetery" and does not relate to the claim. 7. Context idx 8: This context is about "Riverside Cemetery" and does not relate to the claim. 8. Context idx 9: This context is about "Evergreen Cemetery" and does not relate to the claim. The remaining contexts (idx 5 and 6) are not related to the claim at all and are therefore not included in the top 8.
idx: [4, 2, 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine which film was released first, I will rank the contexts based on the publication dates mentioned in the reasoning steps. 1. "Uzhaikkum Karangal" context: This context directly matches the reasoning step mentioning the publication date of 1976, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "The Cemetery Club" context: This context also matches the reasoning step mentioning the publication date of 1993, making it relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "The Cemetery Club (2006 film)" context: Although this context mentions "The Cemetery Club," it refers to a different film released in 2006, which is not directly relevant to the claim but is related by title. 4. "Toussaint L'Ouverture County Cemetery" context: This context is less relevant as it does not pertain to the films in question but is included due to the mention of a "Cemetery Club" related to the cemetery's maintenance.
idx: [4, 2, 0, 1]

step-by-step think:1. "Uzhaikkum Karangal" context: This context directly matches the reasoning step mentioning the film's publication date as 1976, which is relevant to the claim and likely contains the answer. 2. "The Cemetery Club" context: This context also matches the reasoning step mentioning the film's publication date as 1993, making it relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "The Cemetery Club (2006 film)" context: Although this context mentions "The Cemetery Club," it refers to a different film released in 2006, which does not match the reasoning steps but is somewhat relevant due to the title match. 4. "Toussaint L'Overture County Cemetery" context: This context is not relevant to the claim about film release dates and does not match the reasoning steps.

Question:Who was born first out of Overill Dwyer-Brown and Dragan Načevski?
golden idx: [7, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Overill Dwyer-Brown and Dragan Načevski, we need to compare their dates of birth. The reasoning steps provide the necessary information: Overill Dwyer-Brown was born on 4 January 1961, and Dragan Načevski was born on 27 January 1980. Therefore, Overill Dwyer-Brown was born earlier than Dragan Načevski. 

To rank the contexts, we need to prioritize the ones that mention the dates of birth of these individuals. Context 8 directly mentions Overill Dwyer-Brown's date of birth, and context 7 directly mentions Dragan Načevski's date of birth. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. The other contexts do not mention the individuals in question or their dates of birth, so they are not directly relevant to the claim. However, they may still be ranked based on the presence of dates and birth-related information, which could be indirectly relevant.

idx: [8, 7, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim requires identifying who was born first between Overill Dwyer-Brown and Dragan Načevski. The reasoning steps provide the dates of birth for both individuals, which are crucial for answering the claim. 1. Context idx 8: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Overill Dwyer-Brown and her date of birth, which matches one of the reasoning steps. 2. Context idx 7: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions Dragan Načevski and his date of birth, aligning with the other reasoning step. 3. Context idx 6: This context is about Hartley Lobban, another Jamaican-born athlete, which is less relevant but still related to the topic of athletes and their birthdates. 4. Context idx 1: This context is about John McMahon, whose details are not directly relevant to the claim but provide context about athletes' birthdates and nationalities. The other contexts are about individuals unrelated to the claim and do not match the reasoning steps.
idx: [8, 7, 6, 1]

step-by-step think:1. "Overill Dwyer-Brown" context: This context directly matches the first reasoning step, providing the exact date of birth for Overill Dwyer-Brown. It is highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Dragan Načevski" context: This context directly matches the second reasoning step, providing the exact date of birth for Dragan Načevski. It is also highly relevant and contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Hartley Lobban" context: This context is about a different individual and does not match the reasoning steps related to the claim. It is less relevant and less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "John McMahon (Surrey and Somerset cricketer)" context: This context is also about a different individual and does not match the reasoning steps related to the claim. It is less relevant and less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention Overill Dwyer-Brown and Dragan Načevski.

step-by-step think: The claim is about identifying the country of the director of the film "I See You (2006 Film)."

1. Context idx 8: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions "I See You is a 2006 Indian romantic comedy film directed by Vivek Agrawal," which matches both the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 6: This context mentions Vivek Agrawal and provides information about his work, which is relevant to the reasoning steps.
3. Context idx 1: This context is about an Australian director, which is less relevant since the reasoning steps specify India.
4. Context idx 2: This context is about an American director, which is less relevant for the same reason as above.
5. Context idx 4: This context is about a British-American director, which is less relevant for the same reason as above.
6. Context idx 7: This context is about an Israeli director, which is less relevant for the same reason as above.
7. Context idx 3: This context is about the Director of Yale University Press, which is not relevant to the film industry or the claim.

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 8: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "I See You (2006 film)" and the director "Vivek Agrawal," directly addressing the claim and reasoning steps. It also provides additional information about the film being Indian, which implies the director's country of citizenship. 2. Context idx 6: This context is about "Vivek Agrawal" and mentions his work and connections with India, which is relevant to the reasoning steps. However, it does not directly mention his citizenship. 3. Context idx 7: This context mentions a film director and their association with Israel, which is somewhat relevant but does not directly address the claim or reasoning steps. 4. Context idx 4: This context talks about a British-American film director, which could potentially mislead the answer to the claim but is included due to the mention of a film director's nationality. The other contexts (idx 1, 2, 3, 5) are not relevant as they do not mention Vivek Agrawal or the film "I See You," nor do they provide information about a director's nationality that could be confused with the claim.
idx: [8, 6, 7, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "I See You (2006 film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the film "I See You" and the director Vivek Agrawal, directly addressing the claim and the reasoning steps. It provides specific information about the film and its production, which is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Vivek Agrawal" context: This context is also highly relevant because it is specifically about Vivek Agrawal, the director in question.

Leigh" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different film director and does not mention Vivek Agrawal or his country of citizenship. However, it is included as the third context because it is the only other context that mentions a film director, which is related to the claim.

Question:Who lived longer, Louis-Armand-Constantin De Rohan or Adalberto Pereira Dos Santos?
golden idx: [0, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine who lived longer, we need to compare the lifespan of Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan and Adalberto Pereira dos Santos. The reasoning steps provide their dates of birth and death. We can calculate their ages at death and then rank the contexts based on the relevance to these figures.
1. Context idx 8: This context is directly about Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan and provides his exact dates of birth and death, which are crucial for calculating his age.
2. Context idx 0: This context is directly about Adalberto Pereira dos Santos and provides his exact dates of birth and death, which are crucial for calculating his age.
3. Context idx 2: This context is about Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, a different member of the Rohan family, but it is not relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 6: This context is about Louis Constantin de Rohan, another member of the Rohan family, but again, it is not relevant to the claim.
5. Context idx 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9: These contexts are about individuals with the surname 'dos Santos' or 'de Rohan', but they do not provide information relevant to the claim about the lifespans of Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan and Adalberto Pereira dos Santos.

Calculating the ages:
- Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan: 27 July 1794 - 6 April 1732 = 62 years
- Adalberto Pereira dos Santos: 2 April 1984 - 11 April 1905 = 78 years

Adalberto Pereira dos Santos lived longer than Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan.

idx: [8, 0, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine who lived longer, we need to compare the lifespan of Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan and Adalberto Pereira dos Santos. 1. Context idx 8: This context provides the exact dates of birth and death for Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan, which are essential to calculate his lifespan. 2. Context idx 0: This context provides the exact dates of birth and death for Adalberto Pereira dos Santos, which are necessary to calculate his lifespan. 3. Context idx 2: This context is about Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, a different person from Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan, but shares the surname and could be confused with the subject of the claim. 4. Context idx 6: This context is about Louis Constantin de Rohan, another different person who shares the surname but is not the subject of the claim. The other contexts (idx 1, 3, 4, 5) are not relevant as they do not pertain to the individuals in question.
idx: [8, 0, 2, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine who lived longer, we need to calculate the lifespan of both individuals based on their birth and death dates. 1. Context idx 8: This context directly matches the reasoning steps as it provides the exact birth and death dates for Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan, which are crucial for calculating his age. 2. Context idx 0: This context also directly matches the reasoning steps by providing the birth and death dates for Adalberto Pereira dos Santos, allowing us to calculate his age. 3. Context idx 2: This context is about Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, a different member of the Rohan family, and does not provide information relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 6: This context is about Louis Constantin de Rohan, another member of the Rohan family, and also does not provide information relevant to the claim. Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the contexts about Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan and Adalberto Pereira dos Santos are the most useful for answering the question.

The reasoning steps provided are 'Gyrid Olafsdottir of Sweden spouse Harald Bluetooth' and 'Harald Bluetooth mother Thyra'. Therefore, the contexts that mention Harald Bluetooth and Thyra are most relevant. 1. Context idx 8: This context is directly related to Gyrid Of Sweden and mentions her as the spouse of King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, making it highly relevant. 2. Context idx 1: This context mentions Harald Bluetooth and his mother Thyra, directly addressing the entities in the reasoning steps. 3. Context idx 4: This context is about Vera Miletić, who is a mother-in-law, but not related to the claim. 4.

Context idx 9: This context is about Doria Ragland, who is a mother-in-law, but not related to the claim. 8. Context idx 3: This context is about Marian Shields Robinson, who is a mother-in-law, but not related to the claim. The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not mention the entities related to the claim.
idx: [8, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 3]

step-by-step think: To determine the mother-in-law of Gyrid Of Sweden, we need to identify Gyrid's spouse and then find the mother of that spouse. The reasoning steps provided are 'Gyrid Olafsdottir of Sweden spouse Harald Bluetooth' and 'Harald Bluetooth mother Thyra'. Therefore, we are looking for contexts that mention Gyrid's spouse, Harald Bluetooth, and his mother, Thyra. 

1. Context idx 1 ('Harald Bluetooth') is highly relevant as it mentions Harald Bluetooth and his mother, Thyra, directly linking to the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 8 ('Gyrid of Sweden') is also relevant because it mentions Gyrid Olafsdottir as the spouse of King Harald Bluetooth, which is crucial for identifying her mother-in-law.
3. The other contexts mention various individuals who are mothers-in-law in different scenarios, but they do not pertain to Gyrid Of Sweden or Harald Bluetooth, making them less relevant.
4. Among the remaining contexts, none mention Thyra or have a direct connection to the claim, so they are ranked lower.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the reasoning steps, the contexts are ranked as follows:
idx: [1, 8, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine the mother-in-law of Gyrid Of Sweden, we need to identify Gyrid's spouse and then find out who the mother of that spouse is. The reasoning steps provided are 'Gyrid Olafsdottir of Sweden spouse Harald Bluetooth' and 'Harald Bluetooth mother Thyra'. Therefore, we are looking for contexts that mention these relationships. 
1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Harald Bluetooth, his reign, and his mother Thyra. Since Thyra is Harald's mother, she would be Gyrid's mother-in-law, making this context the most informative and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 8: This context is also relevant because it mentions Gyrid Olafsdottir of Sweden and her marriage to King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark. While it does not mention Thyra directly, it is related to the claim through the marriage link.
3. Context idx 5: This context is about Baroness Gösta, who is the mother-in-law of a Dutch Queen, which is unrelated to the claim about Gyrid Of Sweden. However, it is ranked third because it at least discusses the concept of a mother-in-law, even though it is in a different context.
4. Context idx 4: This context is about Vera Miletić and is the least relevant because it does not mention any of the entities related to the claim. It discusses a different mother-in-law relationship that is not connected to Gyrid Of Sweden or Harald Bluetooth.

Question:Where was the place of burial of Gjon Kastrioti Ii's father?
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how well each context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, the relevance to the claim, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. The claim involves the burial place of Gjon Kastrioti II's father, Skanderbeg, and the reasoning steps include 'John Castriot II father Skanderbeg' and 'Skanderbeg place of burial Lezhë'.

1. Context 3 ("Skanderbeg") is the most relevant as it provides extensive information about Skanderbeg, including his life and death, which is directly related to the claim.
2. Context 7 ("Voisava") mentions Skanderbeg as Voisava's son and provides information about his family, which could be indirectly related to the burial place.

6. Context 1 ("Dhimitër Jonima") includes historical context about the period and mentions Gjon Kastrioti, which might be useful.
7. Context 0 ("Skenderbeg Crnojević") is less relevant as it discusses a different Skenderbeg, but it still provides historical context that could be informative.
8. Context 5 ("Gjon Nikollë Kazazi") is the least relevant to the claim but is included as it pertains to the historical period in question.

The remaining contexts (6 and 8) are not related to the claim and are therefore not included in the top 8.

idx: [3,7,2,9,4,1,0,5]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 3 "Skanderbeg": This context is highly relevant as it provides extensive information about Skanderbeg, who is Gjon Kastrioti II's father. It mentions Skanderbeg's life, military achievements, and his role as a national figure. However, it does not explicitly mention his place of burial, which is the key information needed for the claim. 2. Context idx 2 "Gjon Kastrioti II": This context is directly related to Gjon Kastrioti II and provides information about his life and titles. It also mentions his father, Skanderbeg, and his death, which is closely related to the claim. 3.

Context idx 7 "Voisava": This context talks about Skanderbeg's mother, which is indirectly related to the claim. It provides background on the family but does not address the burial place. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not mention Skanderbeg or his burial place directly.

"Gjon Kastrioti II" context: This context is directly related to Gjon Kastrioti II and mentions his father, Skanderbeg, and the period after his death. It is relevant and may contain information about Skanderbeg's burial due to the close relationship between father and son. 3. "Voisava" context: This context mentions Voisava, Skanderbeg's mother, and provides information about the family, which could be indirectly related to the claim. However, it might not be as relevant or likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts that directly mention Skanderbeg.

golden idx: [1, 2, 8, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about the directors of "Der Blindgänger" and "Hotel Desire" being from the same country, I will rank the contexts based on the relevance to the directors and their nationalities. 1. Context idx 1: This context is about "Der Blindgänger" and mentions Andreas Samland, which is directly relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 2: This context is about "Hotel Desire" and mentions Sergej Moya, which is also directly relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 9: This context provides information about Sergej Moya, including his birthplace in Berlin, confirming his German nationality. 4. Context idx 8: This context mentions Andreas Samland and identifies him as a German filmmaker. 5. Context idx 5: This context mentions Michael Hofmann, a German film director, which is somewhat relevant since it deals with German filmmakers. 6. Context idx 6: This context is about Rudolf Carl, an Austrian actor and director, which is less relevant but still within the scope of German-speaking filmmakers. 7. Context idx 4: This context is about Matt Corboy, an American actor, which is not directly relevant but still pertains to the film industry. 8. Context idx 3: This context is about Matt Beckett, a Welsh former professional cyclist, which is the least relevant to the claim.

Context idx 9: This context is also highly relevant as it confirms Sergej Moya's nationality as German, aligning with the reasoning steps. 3. Context idx 1: This context mentions 'Der Blindgänger' and its director Andreas Samland, which is relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 2: This context mentions 'Hotel Desire' and its director Sergej Moya, which is relevant to the claim.

Question:Which film has the director who died later, The Death Kiss or Her Luck In London?
golden idx: [3, 6, 8, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine which film has the director who died later, we need to compare the death dates of the directors of "The Death Kiss" and "Her Luck in London". The reasoning steps provided indicate that Edwin L. Marin, director of "The Death Kiss", died on May 2, 1951, and Maurice Elvey, director of "Her Luck in London", died on August 28, 1967. Therefore, the director who died later is Maurice Elvey. Now, to rank the contexts, we need to find the ones that mention the directors and their death dates. Context 6 directly mentions Edwin L. Marin and his death date, making it highly relevant. Context 3 mentions Maurice Elvey and his death date, also making it highly relevant. Context 8 mentions "The Death Kiss" and Edwin L. Marin, so it's relevant. Context 9 mentions "Her Luck in London" and Maurice Elvey, so it's relevant as well. The other contexts do not mention the directors or films in question and are therefore less relevant.
idx: [6, 3, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 4]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 6: This context provides detailed information about Edwin L. Marin, including his date of death, which is directly relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 3: This context provides detailed information about Maurice Elvey, including his date of death, which is directly relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 8: This context mentions 'The Death Kiss' and its director Edwin L. Marin, which is relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 9: This context mentions 'Her Luck in London' and its director Maurice Elvey, which is relevant to the claim. The other contexts are not relevant as they do not match the entities or relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps.

Question:Which film whose director is younger, The Devil'S Pass Key or La Bella Di Lodi?
golden idx: [1, 2, 3, 4]
step-by-step think: To determine which film's director is younger, we need to compare the birth dates of Erich von Stroheim and Mario Missiroli. Context 4 provides the birth date of Erich von Stroheim as September 22, 1885, and context 3 provides the birth date of Mario Missiroli as March 13, 1934. Therefore, Mario Missiroli is the younger director. Context 1 directly relates to "La bella di Lodi" and provides information about the film and its director, Mario Missiroli. Context 2 directly relates to "The Devil's Pass Key" and provides information about the film and its director, Erich von Stroheim. Context 6 and 7 mention "The Devil's Pass Key" and Erich von Stroheim but are less informative than context 2. The remaining contexts do not provide relevant information to the claim.
idx: [3,4,1,2,6,7,0,5]

step-by-step think: To determine which film's director is younger, we need to compare the birth dates of Erich von Stroheim and Mario Missiroli. The reasoning steps provided include the birth dates for both directors. Context 3 provides detailed information about Mario Missiroli, including his birth date, which is directly relevant to the claim.

Question:Which film has the director who is older, Johnny Concho or One Minute To Twelve?
golden idx: [1, 2, 6, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine which film's director is older, we need to compare the birth dates of Don McGuire and Nunzio Malasomma. Context 2 provides information about Don McGuire, including his date of birth, which is relevant to the claim. Context 7 provides information about Nunzio Malasomma, including his date of birth, which is also relevant to the claim. Since Nunzio Malasomma was born in 1894 and Don McGuire in 1919, Nunzio Malasomma is the older director. Therefore, the film "One Minute to Twelve" has the older director. The contexts that mention the directors and their films are most relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not pertain to the directors in question or their birth dates.
idx: [2, 7, 1, 6, 0, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine which film's director is older, we need to compare the birth dates of Don McGuire and Nunzio Malasomma. The context titled 'Don McGuire (actor)' provides the birth date of Don McGuire as February 28, 1919, which is relevant to the claim. The context titled 'Nunzio Malasomma' provides the birth date of Nunzio Malasomma as 4 February 1894, which is also directly relevant to the claim. Since Nunzio Malasomma was born before Don McGuire, the film 'One Minute to Twelve' has the older director. The context titled 'Johnny Concho' mentions the film directed by Don McGuire, and the context titled 'One Minute to Twelve' mentions the film directed by Nunzio Malasomma. These contexts are relevant because they connect the directors to their respective films. The other contexts do not mention the directors or films in question and are therefore not relevant to the claim.

8. Context idx 6: This context is about Sepideh Farsi, a director, but it does not provide any relevant information to the claim.

The remaining contexts (idx 7 and idx 8) are not included in the top 8 because they do not provide information relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps.

Question:Which film has the director who was born earlier, Red Sparrow or The Flying Liftboy?
golden idx: [1, 3, 4, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine which film has a director born earlier, we need to focus on contexts that provide information about the directors of "Red Sparrow" and "The Flying Liftboy" and their dates of birth. 1. Context 4: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Ben Sombogaart's date of birth directly, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. Context 1: This context provides the date of birth for Francis Lawrence, which is necessary for comparison. 3. Context 7: This context is relevant because it confirms Ben Sombogaart as the director of "The Flying Liftboy." 4. Context 3: This context is relevant as it confirms Francis Lawrence as the director of "Red Sparrow." 5. Context 8: This context is somewhat relevant as it provides background on the novel "Red Sparrow," which the film is based on, but does not directly contribute to the claim. 6. Context 0: This context mentions a director named Ben, but it is not the correct Ben (Ben Palmer instead of Ben Sombogaart), so it is less relevant. 7. Context 2: This context is about a different director and is not relevant to the claim. 8. Context 5: This context is about another director and does not contribute to the claim. 9. Context 6: This context is about a television director and is not relevant to the claim. 10. Context 9: This context is about a director with no connection to the claim.
idx: [4, 1, 7, 3, 8, 0, 2, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Ben Sombogaart" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact date of birth for Ben Sombogaart, which is crucial for answering the claim. 2. "Francis Lawrence" context: Similar to the first context, this one provides the exact date of birth for Francis Lawrence, directly addressing the claim. 3. "The Flying Liftboy" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the film directed by Ben Sombogaart, connecting to the claim about the director's birth date. 4. "Red Sparrow" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the film directed by Francis Lawrence, connecting to the claim about the director's birth date.

Question:Which film has the director who was born first, Hanuman Patal Vijay or Young And Dangerous: The Prequel?
golden idx: [1, 5, 7, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine which film has the director who was born first, we need to compare the birth dates of Homi Wadia and Andrew Lau. Since Homi Wadia was born on 22 May 1911 and Andrew Lau on 4 April 1960, Homi Wadia was born earlier. Therefore, the film directed by Homi Wadia, "Hanuman Patal Vijay," has the director who was born first. Now, to rank the contexts, we need to consider the relevance to the directors and their birth dates.
1. Context idx 7: This context is about Homi Wadia and includes his date of birth, directly addressing the reasoning steps.
2. Context idx 9: This context is about Andrew Lau and includes his date of birth, also directly addressing the reasoning steps.
3. Context idx 1: This context is about the film "Hanuman Patal Vijay" directed by Homi Wadia, which is relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 5: This context is about the film "Young and Dangerous: The Prequel" directed by Andrew Lau, which is relevant to the claim.
5. Context idx 0, 2, 3, 6: These contexts are about other films directed by Andrew Lau, which are less directly relevant to the claim but still provide information about the director.
6. Context idx 4, 8: These contexts are about films involving Meena Kumari and Homi Wadia but are less directly relevant to the claim compared to the others.
idx: [7, 9, 1, 5, 0, 2, 3, 6]

step-by-step think: 
1. In the first reasoning step, "Hanuman Patal Vijay director Homi Wadia" is mentioned. This matches the title of context 1, "Hanuman Patal Vijay". This context provides information about Homi Wadia's career as a director, which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. In the second reasoning step, "Young and Dangerous: The Prequel director Andrew Lau" is mentioned. This matches the title of context 5, "Young and Dangerous: The Prequel". This context provides information about Andrew Lau's career as a director, which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. In the third reasoning step, "Homi Wadia date of birth 22 May 1911" is mentioned. Although the birthdate is not explicitly mentioned in any context, we can infer from context 7, "Homi Wadia", that he was born on May 22, 1911. This context provides information about Homi Wadia's career, which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.
4. In the fourth reasoning step, "Andrew Lau date of birth 4 April 1960" is mentioned. Although the birthdate is not explicitly mentioned in any context, we can infer from context 9, "Andrew Lau", that he was born on April 4, 1960. This context provides information about Andrew Lau's career, which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.

Based on the above reasoning steps, the rankings of the contexts are as follows:
idx: [1, 5, 7, 9]

Question:Which film has the director who died first, The Boss And The Worker or Claire'S Knee?
golden idx: [2, 3, 6, 7]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to identify which director between Steno and Éric Rohmer died first. The contexts that directly mention these directors and their death dates are most relevant. 1. "Steno (director)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Steno and his date of death, directly addressing part of the claim. 2. "Éric Rohmer" context: This context is also highly relevant as it mentions Éric Rohmer and his date of death, directly addressing the other part of the claim. 3. "Claire's Knee" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the film "Claire's Knee" and its director, Éric Rohmer, which is related to the claim. 4. "The Boss and the Worker" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the film "The Boss and the Worker" and its director, Steno, which is related to the claim. 5. "Swimming with Sharks" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions a different film with a similar title but does not provide information about the directors in question. 6. "Goffredo Parise" context: This context mentions "The Boss" in the title, which might cause confusion with "The Boss and the Worker," but it is not directly related to the claim. 7. "The Boss of Big Town" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention the directors or films in question. 8. "Abhishek Saxena" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it mentions a different director and films. 9. "Ben Palmer" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it mentions a different director and TV shows. 10. "John Vitale (mobster)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a mobster and not the film industry.
idx: [3, 2, 6, 7, 1, 4, 8, 0]

step-by-step think: To determine which film's director died first, we need to compare the death dates of the directors of "The Boss and the Worker" and "Claire's Knee". The reasoning steps provided the death dates of Steno (13 March 1988) and Éric Rohmer (11 January 2010). Therefore, we need contexts that confirm these dates and the directorship of the respective films.
1. Context idx 3 ("Steno (director)"): This context is highly relevant as it confirms Steno's death date and his role as a director, directly addressing the claim.
2. Context idx 2 ("Éric Rohmer"): This context is also highly relevant because it confirms Éric Rohmer's death date and his contributions to cinema, which includes directing "Claire's Knee".
3. Context idx 7 ("The Boss and the Worker"): This context is relevant as it confirms that Steno directed "The Boss and the Worker".
4. Context idx 6 ("Claire's Knee"): This context is relevant because it confirms that "Claire's Knee" is a film directed by Éric Rohmer.
The other contexts are less relevant as they do not provide information about the directors' death dates or their association with the films in question.

Question:Do both films Fig Leaves and Boogeyman (Film) have the directors that share the same nationality?
golden idx: [3, 5, 8, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to confirm the nationalities of the directors of both films. Context 8 provides information about "Fig Leaves" and its director Howard Hawks, who is American. Context 9 gives detailed information about Howard Hawks, confirming his American citizenship. Context 5 mentions Stephen Kay and identifies him as New Zealand-born American, which is crucial for the claim. Context 3 talks about "Boogeyman (film)" and its director Stephen Kay, which is directly relevant. The other contexts are less relevant because they do not mention the directors or their nationalities. Therefore, they rank lower.
idx: [8, 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Howard Hawks" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms Howard Hawks' American citizenship, directly addressing one of the reasoning steps. 2. "Stephen Kay" context: Similarly, this context is crucial because it establishes Stephen Kay's New Zealand-American dual nationality, which is a key point in the reasoning steps. 3. "Fig Leaves" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Howard Hawks as the director of the film, which is part of the claim. However, it does not provide information about his nationality. 4. "Boogeyman (film)" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Stephen Kay as the director of the film and describes the film's New Zealand-American production, which indirectly supports the reasoning step regarding Stephen Kay's nationality.

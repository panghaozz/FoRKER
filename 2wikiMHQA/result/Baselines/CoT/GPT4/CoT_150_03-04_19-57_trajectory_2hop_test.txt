Question:Who lived longer, Giuseppe Cesari or Nicos Poulantzas?

Right Answer:Giuseppe Cesari
Answer: Giuseppe Cesari lived longer than Nicos Poulantzas.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. Giuseppe Cesari was born in February 1568 and died on 3 July 1640. To calculate his age at death, we subtract his birth year from his death year: 1640 - 1568 = 72 years. Since he died after his birthday in 1640, he lived for 72 years.
2. Nicos Poulantzas was born on 21 September 1936 and died on 3 October 1979. To calculate his age at death, we subtract his birth year from his death year: 1979 - 1936 = 43 years. Since he died after his birthday in 1979, he lived for 43 years.
3. Comparing the two ages, 72 years (Giuseppe Cesari) is greater than 43 years (Nicos Poulantzas). 
4. Therefore, Giuseppe Cesari lived longer than Nicos Poulantzas.

Question:Who lived longer, Edward Dearle or Michael Doeberl?

Right Answer:Edward Dearle
Answer: Michael Doeberl lived longer than Edward Dearle.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. Edward Dearle was born on 2 March 1806 and died on 20 March 1891. To calculate his age at death, we subtract his birth year from his death year: 1891 - 1806 = 85 years. Since he died after his birthday in March, he lived for 85 years.
2. Michael Doeberl was born on 15 January 1861 and died on 24 March 1928. Similarly, we calculate his age at death: 1928 - 1861 = 67 years. Since he also died after his birthday in January, he lived for 67 years.
3. Comparing the two ages, Edward Dearle lived for 85 years, while Michael Doeberl lived for 67 years.
4. Therefore, Edward Dearle lived longer than Michael Doeberl.

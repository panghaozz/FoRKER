1. Jeedar is directed by Kaifee. [Context: {'idx': 2, 'title': 'Jeedar', 'paragraph_text': 'Jeedar( Punjabi:) is a 1981 Pakistani action film. Directed by Kaifee, also known as simply Kaifi and produced by Amina Fyaz. The film starring Sultan Rahi, Anjuman, Mustafa Qureshi, Adeeb.'}]
2. The Rebel Set is directed by Gene Fowler Jr. [Context: {'idx': 7, 'title': 'The Rebel Set', 'paragraph_text': 'The Rebel Set is a 1959 American crime drama film directed by Gene Fowler Jr. It was later featured and riffed on" Mystery Science Theater 3000" in Season 4.'}]

Both brothers worked with each other to make some highly successful films in Pakistan. Kaifee himself was a film actor and a film director.'}]
4. Gene Fowler Jr.'s date of birth is 27 May 1917. [Context: {'idx': 0, 'title': 'Gene Fowler Jr.', 'paragraph_text': 'Gene Fowler Jr.( 27 May 1917 – 11 May 1998), the eldest son of journalist and author Gene Fowler, was a prominent Hollywood film editor.

He was also the director of feature films as well as numerous television programs. While the majority of his directorial work is regarded as minor efforts( Leonard Maltin lists only three of his seven features in his compendium), two of his films," I Was a Teenage Werewolf"( 1957) and" I Married a Monster from Outer Space"( 1958), have gained some critical attention in retrospect. Gene Fowler Jr. was married to film editor Marjorie Fowler from 1944 until his death. He died in Woodland Hills, California of natural causes. His brother Will Fowler( 1922–2004) was a Hollywood screenwriter.'}]

Based on the reasoning steps and the evidence provided, we can conclude that Jeedar, directed by Kaifee, is the film whose director is younger.

Question:Who is the spouse of the Green performer?
Right Answer:Miquette Giraudy
Answer: The spouse of the Green performer is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided includes information about various individuals and topics related to the name "Green," but none of the paragraphs specifically mention a performer named Green or their spouse. The references to Grant Green, a jazz guitarist, do not include details about his marital status or spouse.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. I reviewed the context provided, which includes multiple entries about different subjects related to "Green."
2. The first few entries focus on Grant Green, a jazz guitarist, but do not provide any information about his personal life or spouse.
3. Other entries discuss unrelated topics, such as the color green, lakes, and various albums, none of which mention a spouse of a performer named Green.
4. Since there is no direct mention of a spouse for any performer named Green in the context, I conclude that the information is not available in the provided text.

Question:Who is the grandmother of Philippe, Duke of Orléans?
Right Answer:Marie de' Medici
Answer: The grandmother of Philippe, Duke of Orléans, is Anne of Austria.

Evidence and explanation: Philippe, Duke of Orléans, was the son of Louis XIII of France and Anne of Austria. Therefore, Anne of Austria is his mother, and since Philippe's father, Louis XIII, is the son of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici, Marie de' Medici is Philippe's paternal grandmother. However, the question specifically asks for the grandmother of Philippe, Duke of Orléans, which can also refer to his maternal lineage. 

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. Philippe, Duke of Orléans, was born on September 21, 1640, to Louis XIII of France and Anne of Austria.
2. Louis XIII's mother was Marie de' Medici, making her Philippe's paternal grandmother.
3. On the maternal side, Anne of Austria was the daughter of Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria, which means she is also a grandmother to Philippe.
4. Therefore, both Marie de' Medici and Anne of Austria can be considered grandmothers of Philippe, Duke of Orléans, but the most direct answer to the question is Anne of Austria, as she is his mother.

2. In the context, there is a specific mention of "Asian Man Records," which is described as a DIY record label run by Mike Park. It was established in 1996 after he initially started releasing music under the name Dill Records in 1989.
3. Since Mike Park is the founder of Asian Man Records and is also part of The Bruce Lee Band, it logically follows that the record label he started is Asian Man Records.

1. I reviewed the context provided, particularly focusing on the paragraph titled "The Blackout All-Stars."
2. The paragraph states that The Blackout All-Stars was a Latin supergroup formed in 1994 and lists several prominent musicians, including Ray Barretto, Sheila E., Tito Puente, and others.

Question:What event caused the founder of Australia's liberal party to become Prime Minister?
Right Answer:Lyons' death in 1939
Answer: The event that caused the founder of Australia's Liberal Party, Robert Menzies, to become Prime Minister was the death of Joseph Lyons in 1939.

Evidence and explanation: Joseph Lyons was the Prime Minister of Australia and the leader of the United Australia Party (UAP) until his death in 1939. Following his passing, Robert Menzies, who was a prominent figure in the UAP and had previously served as Prime Minister from 1939 to 1941, assumed the role of Prime Minister.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. Joseph Lyons was the Prime Minister of Australia and led the UAP from January 1932 until his death in 1939 (as noted in the context about the Lyons Government).
2. After Lyons' death, the leadership of the UAP was crucial for the party's continuity and direction during a tumultuous time, particularly with the onset of World War II.
3. Robert Menzies, who had been a significant political figure and had previously served as Prime Minister, was positioned to take over the leadership of the party and the role of Prime Minister following Lyons' death.
4. Menzies' assumption of the Prime Ministership was a direct result of the vacancy created by Lyons' passing, marking a significant transition in Australian politics during that period. 

Thus, the event that led to Menzies becoming Prime Minister was indeed the death of Joseph Lyons.

Question:What event caused the Liberal Party of Australia's longest-serving leader to become Prime Minister?
Right Answer:Lyons' death in 1939
Answer: The event that caused the Liberal Party of Australia's longest-serving leader, Robert Menzies, to become Prime Minister was the defeat of the Labor government of Ben Chifley in the 1949 federal election.

Evidence and explanation: Robert Menzies became Prime Minister after leading the Liberal Party to victory against the Labor government in 1949. This victory was influenced by various factors, including public discontent with Labor's proposals to nationalize banks and the impact of a crippling coal strike led by the Australian Communist Party.

1. The context mentions that Robert Menzies led the Liberal Party to victory over the Labor government of Ben Chifley in 1949 (Context idx 7).
2. The defeat of the Labor government was significant because it marked a shift in power and allowed Menzies to assume the role of Prime Minister.
3. The reasons for the Liberal Party's success included opposition to Labor's nationalization proposals and the effects of labor strikes, which resonated with voters at the time.
4. Menzies' leadership and the Liberal Party's policies appealed to the electorate, leading to their electoral success and Menzies' long tenure as Prime Minister.

Question:What was the average per capita GVA in 2013 of the country which created Burma's academic system?
Right Answer:£23,755
Answer: The average per capita GVA in 2013 of the country which created Burma's academic system (the United Kingdom) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the UK has a high per capita GVA, likely above the national average of £23,755 mentioned for Plymouth.

Evidence and explanation: The context mentions that the educational system of Myanmar is based on the United Kingdom's system due to nearly a century of British presence. This indicates that the UK is the country that created Burma's academic system. While the specific per capita GVA for the UK in 2013 is not provided, the context does provide a figure for Plymouth's GVA per person, which is £19,943, and states that this is lower than the national average of £23,755.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. Identify the country that created Burma's academic system: The context states that Myanmar's education system is based on the United Kingdom's system.
2. Look for economic data related to the UK: The context does not provide specific per capita GVA for the UK in 2013, but it does mention Plymouth's GVA per person and the national average.
3. Conclude that while we do not have the exact figure for the UK, it is reasonable to assume that the average per capita GVA in the UK would be higher than the £23,755 national average mentioned for Plymouth, given that Plymouth is a city and typically has lower economic metrics compared to the national average. Thus, the average per capita GVA in 2013 for the UK would likely be above this figure.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided does not explicitly state where Joseph was born, but it is widely accepted in Christian tradition that Joseph was from Bethlehem, as he is described as being of the lineage of David, who was from that city.

Question:Whom is the birth place of Ravil Aryapov named after?
Right Answer:Palmiro Togliatti
Answer: The birthplace of Ravil Aryapov, Stavropol, is named after the city of Stavropol, which is derived from the Greek words "stauros" (meaning "cross") and "polis" (meaning "city").

Evidence and explanation: The context provided includes information about Ravil Aryapov, specifically mentioning that he was born in Stavropol, which is now known as Tolyatti. However, there is no direct mention of whom the birthplace is named after in the provided context. 

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The context mentions Ravil Aryapov's birthplace as Stavropol, which is a city in Russia.
2. To understand the name "Stavropol," we can analyze its etymology. The name is derived from Greek, where "stauros" means "cross" and "polis" means "city." 
3. Therefore, while the context does not explicitly state whom the birthplace is named after, it can be inferred that the name itself reflects a historical or cultural significance rather than being named after a specific individual.

Question:What happened to the Curonians who lived in the area where Erich Zakowski was born?
Right Answer:expelled by the Soviet Union
Answer: The Curonians who lived in the area where Erich Zakowski was born faced significant hardships, including expulsion by the Soviet Union after many fled from the Red Army during the evacuation of East Prussia.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided states that many Curonians fled from the Red Army during the evacuation of East Prussia, and those who remained were expelled by the Soviet authorities. By 1955, only 219 Curonians were left along the Curonian Spit, and many had German names, which led to discrimination against them. The Soviet authorities viewed the Curonians as fascists, which contributed to their difficult situation and prompted many to immigrate to West Germany in 1958.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The context mentions that the Curonians fled from the Red Army during the evacuation of East Prussia, indicating a significant displacement due to conflict.
2. It further states that those who stayed behind were expelled by the Soviet Union, highlighting the forced removal of the remaining Curonian population.
3. The mention of only 219 Curonians living along the Curonian Spit in 1955 illustrates the drastic reduction in their numbers due to these events.
4. The context also notes that many Curonians had German names, which led to anti-German discrimination, further complicating their situation.
5. Finally, the context concludes that many Curonians immigrated to West Germany in 1958, indicating a search for safety and stability after their expulsion and discrimination in their homeland. 

This sequence of events clearly outlines the fate of the Curonians in the area where Erich Zakowski was born.

Question:When did the crowning of the person under whom the Chapter House was built happen?
Right Answer:1216
Answer: The crowning of Henry III, under whom the Chapter House was built, took place on 17 May 1220.

Evidence and explanation: The context provides information that the Chapter House at Westminster Abbey was built during the reign of Henry III, specifically between 1245 and 1253.

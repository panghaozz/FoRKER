Question:Which film was released more recently, Lo Zappatore or Placer Sangriento?
golden idx: [4, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is about determining which film was released more recently between "Lo Zappatore" and "Placer Sangriento." The reasoning steps provide the publication dates for both films: 1950 for "Lo Zappatore" and 1967 for "Placer Sangriento." Therefore, the most relevant contexts are those that directly mention these films and their release dates.

8. "Lloyd (film)" context (idx 3): This mentions a release year (2001), which is not relevant to the claim but provides a reference point for film release dates.

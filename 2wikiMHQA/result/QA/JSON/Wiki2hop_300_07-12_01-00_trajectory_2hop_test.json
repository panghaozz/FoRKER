His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, \"Dust Bowl Ballads\", is included on \"Mojo\" magazine\\'s list of 100 Records That Changed The World.

After he left Zeeland, he took up service with Charles II of Naples, who made him constable of the Kingdom of Naples. After his marriage with Isabella (16 September 1289), he had one daughter: Matilda. She would succeed him and her mother as princess. Florent settled with his wife in Morea. He negotiated the Treaty of Glarentsa with the Byzantine Empire in 1290. The situation for the Franks in Greece was hopeless by this time, however. The fall of the Angevins in Sicily meant that they were preoccupied with recouping territory there and few Western governments would send troops to defend Morea. Florent thus made peace and maintained it until 1293, when the Greeks retook Kalamata. Florent did not despair and did not reopen the war which had been ongoing until his succession: he instead sent an embassy in protest to Andronikos II Palaiologos, and the emperor returned Kalamata.

Widowed in 1308, she was engaged to Charles of Taranto until 1313, when she remarried to Louis of Burgundy, who held the titular dignity of the long- extinct Kingdom of Thessalonica. The marriage was intended to unite the Angevin and Burgundian houses. So was the betrothal of the Empress Catherine II to Hugh V of Burgundy, Louis's elder brother. However, Charles of Valois, Catherine's father, nixed the marriage and instead married her to Philip of Taranto. It was in an effort to compensate the Burgundians that Philip renounced his claim to Achaea in favour of Matilda and gave her hand to Louis. From 1307, when Philip of Savoy relinquished his claim, to 1312, when Isabella of Villehardouin died, Achaea was disputed between two claimants: Isabella and Philip I of Taranto. In 1313, Philip granted it to Matilda, daughter of Isabella and her first husband Florent of Hainaut. On Isabella's death, however, Ferdinand of Majorca laid claim to the principality in right of his wife, Isabella of Sabran, the daughter of Isabella's younger sister Margaret of Villehardouin. The new couple quickly left for Greece to take possession of their fief, which was then occupied by their rival Ferdinand. At the Battle of Manolada on 5 July 1316, Ferdinand was vanquished and killed and Louis took control of the Elis. However, he was poisoned soon after, leaving a twice- widowed 23- year- old in charge of the Morea.

His best-known works include \"Fa\u00e7ade\", the cantata \"Belshazzar\\'s Feast\", the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems \"Crown Imperial\" and \"Orb and Sceptre\". Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, \"Fa\u00e7ade\", which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, \"Troilus and Cressida\", was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large.

Her winner\\'s single, a cover of Kelly Clarkson\\'s \"A Moment Like This\", peaked at number one for four weeks on the UK Singles Chart and broke a world record for reaching 50,000 digital downloads within 30 minutes. In February 2007, Lewis signed a five-album contract in the United States with Clive Davis\\'s record label, J Records. Lewis\\'s success continued with the release of her debut album, \"Spirit\", in 2007; it was certified 10\u00d7 platinum in the United Kingdom and became the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s.

De Rohan was born in la Mancha, Spain on 18 April 1725. His father was French, but had been banished to Spain. He served in the courts of Madrid and Parma, before becoming an ambassador to Francis I. He eventually joined the Order of St. John, and served in several posts. He was considered as a potential successor to Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca following his death in 1773, but Francisco Ximenes de Texada was elected instead. Ximenes\\' magistracy was unpopular due to the Order\\'s bankruptcy. He died in 1775, and was succeeded by De Rohan. De Rohan sought to win the respect of the people, and he became a popular Grand Master. On 21 June 1777, he elevated the village of \u017bebbu\u0121 to the status of city, naming it Citt\u00e0 Rohan. An archway commemorating this event was constructed in 1798. The coat of arms of \u017bebbu\u0121 contains the arms of the House of Rohan, in honour of the Grand Master. De Rohan authored the\" Code de Rohan\", a constitutional law book published in two volumes titled\" Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes of Malta\" in 1782. This Grand Master was also responsible for the publication of the Diritto Municipale in 1784. De Rohan instituted the Anglo- Bavarian langue, which was housed in the former Palazzo Carniero. In 1797, he established the Russian Grand Priory, which later evolved into the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller. In 1792, he commissioned and partially financed the construction of Fort Tign\u00e9.

A member of the noble Kastrioti family, he was sent to the Ottoman court as hostage, where he was educated and entered the service of the Ottoman sultan for the next twenty years. He rose through the ranks, culminating in the appointment as \"sanjakbey\" (governor) of the Sanjak of Dibra in 1440. In 1443, he deserted the Ottomans during the Battle of Ni\u0161 and became the ruler of Kruj\u00eb, Svetigrad, and Modri\u010d. In 1444, he was appointed the chief commander of the short-lived League of Lezh\u00eb that consolidated nobility throughout what is today Northern Albania. Thus, for the first time Albania was united under a single leader. Skanderbeg\\'s rebellion was not a general uprising of Albanians, because he did not gain support in the Venetian-controlled north or in the Ottoman-controlled south. His followers included, apart from Albanians, also Slavs, Vlachs, and Greeks. Despite this military valor he was not able to do more than to hold his own possessions within the very small area in nowadays northern Albania where almost all of his victories against the Ottomans took place. His rebellion was a national rebellion. The resistance led by him brought Albanians of different regions and dialects together in a common cause, helping define the ethnic identity of the Albanians. Skanderbeg\\'s military skills presented a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion, and he was considered by many in western Europe to be a model of Christian resistance against Muslims. For 25 years, from 1443 to 1468, Skanderbeg\\'s 10,000 man army marched through Ottoman territory winning against consistently larger and better supplied Ottoman forces, for which he was admired. Skanderbeg always signed himself in (\"Lord of Albania\"), and claimed no other titles but that in documents. In 1451, he recognized \"de jure\" the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Naples over Albania through the Treaty of Gaeta, to ensure a protective alliance, although he remained a \"de facto\" independent ruler. In 1460\u201361, he participated in Italy\\'s civil wars in support of Ferdinand I of Naples. In 1463, he became the chief commander of the crusading forces of Pope Pius II, but the Pope died while the armies were still gathering. Together with Venetians he fought against the Ottomans during the Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u20131479) until his death in January 1468. He ranks high in that military history, as the most persistent opponent of the Ottoman Empire in its heyday who was also ever-victorious.'}, {'idx': 2, 'title': 'Gjon Kastrioti II', 'paragraph_text': \"John Castriot II (1456\u20131502), was the son of Skanderbeg, the Albanian national hero, and of Donika Kastrioti, daughter of Gjergj Arianiti.

In 1495 Ferdinand I of Naples gave the title of the Signore of Gagliano del Capo and Oria. While in his teens he was forced to leave the country after the death of his father in 1468.

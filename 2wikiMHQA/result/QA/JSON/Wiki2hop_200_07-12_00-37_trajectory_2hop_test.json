He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the 1660 Restoration of the monarchy until his death. Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France. After Charles I\\'s execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War, the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649. However, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a \"de facto\" republic led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649. Charles\\'s English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his cousin King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates\\'s revelations of a supposed Popish Plot sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles\\'s brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, was a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death in 1685. He was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed. Charles was one of the most popular and beloved kings of England, known as the \"Merry Monarch\", in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans. Charles\\'s wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses.

On 1 October 1674, he was created Earl of Northumberland, Baron of Pontefract (Yorkshire) and Viscount Falmouth (Cornwall). On 6 April 1683, he was created Duke of Northumberland. The first Duke of Northumberland was born at Merton College, Oxford. In 1682, he was employed on secret service in Venice. Upon his return to England in 1684, he was elected (10 January) and installed (8 April) Knight of the Garter. That summer, he served as a volunteer on the side of the French at the Siege of Luxembourg. In 1687, Northumberland commanded the 2nd Troop of Horse Guards. A year later, he was appointed a lord of His Majesty's bedchamber.

{"ID": "209", "Question": "Who is the mother of Edward I Of England?", "Right Answer": "Eleanor of Provence", "Support idx": "[4, 9, 6]", "context": "[{'idx': 4, 'title': 'Henry III of England', 'paragraph_text': \"Henry III (1 October 1207 \u2013 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death. The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard Marshal, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Henry supported his brother Richard of Cornwall in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund Crouchback on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. In 1263, one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death; however, he was not canonised.\"}, {'idx': 9, 'title': 'Edward I of England', 'paragraph_text': 'Edward I (17/18 June 1239 \u2013 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots , was King of England from 1272 to 1307. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father\\'s reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons\\' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward\\'s attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276\u201377, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282\u201383 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. The war that followed continued after Edward\\'s death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems. Edward I was a tall man (6\\'2\") for his era, hence the nickname \"Longshanks\". He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657.'}, {'idx': 6, 'title': 'Henry, son of Edward I', 'paragraph_text': 'Henry of England( 6 May 1268 \u2013 14 October 1274 in Merton, Surrey) was the fifth child and second son of Edward I of England by his first wife, Eleanor of Castile.'}]", "processed context": "[{'idx': 4, 'title': 'Henry III of England', 'paragraph_text': \"(Eleanor of Provence), (Henry III), (1 October 1207), (16 November 1272), (Henry of Winchester), (King of England), (Ireland), (Duke of Aquitaine), (1216), (John), (Isabella), (Henry), (Guala), (Henry), (William Marshal), (Lincoln), (Sandwich), (1217), (Henry), (1225), (Hubert de Burgh), (Peter des Roches), (1230), (France), (William Marshal's), (Richard Marshal), (1232), (Church), (Henry), (England), (Henry), (Edward the Confessor), (Jews), (England), (Jews), (the Statute of Jewry), (France), (Poitou), (1242), (Battle of Taillebourg), (Henry), (Frederick II), (Holy Roman Emperor), (Henry), (Richard), (Cornwall), (Romans), (1256), (Edmund Crouchback), (Sicily), (Gascony), (1258), (Henry), (Poitevin), (Lusignans), (Eleanor), (Poitevins), (England), (Oxford), (Henry), (France), (1259), (Henry), (France), (King Louis), (Gascony), (Henry), (England), (1263), (Simon de Montfort), (the Second Barons' War), (Henry), (Louis), (The Battle of Lewes), (1264), (Henry), (Henry), (Edward), (the Battle of Evesham), (Henry), (Church), (Henry), (Jews), (Henry), (1272), (Edward), (Westminster Abbey), (the second half), (1290)\"}, {'idx': 9, 'title': 'Edward I of England', 'paragraph_text': \"(17/18 June 1239), (7 July 1307), (Edward Longshanks), (the Hammer of the Scots), (King of England), (1307), (Edward), (Henry III), (Edward), (1259), (Oxford), (the Second Barons' War), (the Battle of Lewes), (Edward), (a few months), (Simon de Montfort), (the Battle of Evesham), (1265), (two years), (England), (Edward), (Edward), (1272), (England), (1274), (Westminster Abbey), (19 August), (Edward), (Wales), (1276\u201377), (Edward), (1282\u201383), (Wales), (English), (English), (Scotland), (Edward), (Edward), (Edward), (France), (Scottish), (French), (Philip IV), (the Kingdom of England), (Edward), (Scotland), (the mid-1290s), (Edward), (1307), (Edward II), (Scotland), (Longshanks), (Edward), (Edward), (Henry III), (Parliament), (the Welsh and Scots), (the Edict of Expulsion), (1290), (Jews), (England), (over 350 years), (Oliver Cromwell), (1657)\"}, {'idx': 6, 'title': 'Henry, son of Edward I', 'paragraph_text': '(Henry of England), (6 May 1268), (14 October 1274), (Merton), (Surrey), (Edward I of), (England), (Eleanor of Castile)'}]", "response": "Answer: Eleanor of Provence\nEvidence and explanation: The reasoning steps provided indicate that Henry III is the father of Edward I of England and his spouse is Eleanor of Provence, which implies that Eleanor of Provence is the mother of Edward I.\nStep by step with evidence and explanation:\n1.

In an effort to increase the Romanian work force, former communist leader Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu outlawed contraception and abortion in 1966. Thousands of unwanted children were placed in state orphanages where they faced terrible conditions. With the fall of Communism, many children from the orphanages moved into the streets while others were runaways from impoverished families. Today there are 20,000 children living in the streets while the resources for sheltering these homeless youths are severely limited. \" Children Underground\" follows the story of five street children, aged eight to sixteen who live in a subway station in Bucharest, Romania. The street kids are encountered daily by commuting adults, who pass them by in the station as they starve, swindle, and steal, all while searching desperately for a fresh can of paint to get high with. Belzberg and her cameraman, Wolfgang Held, maintain their distance as the kids panhandle, fight and sleep on cardboard boxes, either on the train platforms or the public parks above ground, watching dispassionately as the youngsters inhale Aurolac, a noxious silver paint with intoxicating fumes, from plastic bags. In a slightly uplifting coda, Belzberg and crew return a year later to find that a police who swept off the Victoriei has dispersed the children. Some of them landed in state- funded homes, while others simply moved on to one of the many abandoned construction sites that dot the city. Belzberg steers away from any discussion of the rampant sexual exploitation of these young children or the fact that one of the biggest dangers they face are STDs, including AIDS, but the urban hell she presents is shattering enough. Homelessness is all too familiar to many inhabitants in the world\\'s wealthiest cities, but rarely has the situation seemed so hopeless, or its victims so desperate. One of the children director Belzberg follows is Cristina Ionescu. At first, this child looked like a young man, but one later finds out that girls have to become tough and look boyish in order to survive. This is also very apparent with another child named, Violeta\\' Macarena\\' Rosu, who is also a girl. The nickname\\' Macarena\\' derives from the song\" Macarena\", her favorite. Three other children, Mihai Tudose, and brother and sister Ana and Marian, are also profiled.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby\\'s mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d\\'origineluogo d\\'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother\\'s or father\\'s place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder\\'s place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby\\'s parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant\\'s\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant\\'s\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

He was the elder son of Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden and his second wife Anna of Oettingen. Jacob I was a man of deep religious beliefs, well known as a founder of churches. He founded the monastery at Fremersberg and was a major benefactor of the Stiftskirche at Baden-Baden. According to his father\\'s precepts, only two of his sons were to be considered heirs of the margravate. Therefore, only Charles and Bernard received a secular education; the other children had a strict religious upbringing. George, after taking a religious profession in his youth, returned briefly to the world, but in 1454 reverted to\\nholy orders and later became Bishop of Metz. Jacob I was the opposite of his father; Enea Silvio de Piccolomini (Pope Pius II) characterized him as \"famous among the Germans for his justice and intelligence\". In his early years he was ruler of the family possessions in Hohenberg, until at the age of 24 he succeeded to the government of Baden. He was described as a pugnacious knight and a frugal father of the state and was popular among the princes as a mediator. Both Emperor Sigismund and Emperor Frederick III, under whom he served, thought highly of him. When as the result of a miscarriage his sister Agnes fled in the middle of a conflict about inheritance, the Margrave lost his claim to the Duchy of Schleswig. He was so angry that he confined Agnes for the rest of her life in Eberstein Castle in Ebersteinburg. (The incident is remembered as the \"Double Disaster of Gottorf\").

John II of Baden was the third son of Margrave Jacob I of Baden-Baden and his wife Catherine de Lorraine. John was given a strict religious upbringing, as he was destined from an early age for an ecclesiastical career. At the urging of his father, most of his siblings also followed a religious career, the exceptions being his two oldest brothers Charles I and Bernard II and his sister Margaret. He studied in Erfurt, Pavia and Cologne from 1452 to 1456, together with his younger brothers George and Mark. On 21 June 1456, at the age of 22, he was elected Archbishop of Trier as \"John II of Baden\". His mother was from Lorraine and had connections with Trier. Pope Calixtus III confirmed him as administrator of Trier, because he had not yet reached the minimum age of 35 for consecration as bishop. When he reached that age in 1465, he was consecrated by his suffragan bishop Hubertis Agrippina and the bishops of Metz and Worms. In 1459, Diether von Isenburg was elected Archbishop of Mainz, ahead of Adolph II of Nassau by a narrow margin. However, the Pope did not confirm Dieter\\'s election. This led to the Baden-Palatinate War, in which John II and his brothers participated on the side of Adolph II of Nassau. John II of Baden supported reform in the Benedictine monasteries and encouraged them to join the Bursfelde Congregation. In 1469, he sent Johann Fart, the prior of the St. Mary monastery in Trier to the Maria Laach Abbey, where Johann acted as a reformer abbot. Johann was the 21st abbott, his tenure lasted from 1470 to 1491. By appointing Johann, John II thwarted the intentions of Archbishop Rupert of Cologne, who had a different reform candidate in mind. During John II\\'s reign, the long-anticipated University of Trier was founded on 16 March 1473. The University provided coursed in theology, philosophy, medicine and law.

On 1932, while in New York City, Fernando Cort\u00e9s married Puerto Rican childhood friend Mar\u00eda del Pilar Cordero, who adopted the stage name of Mapy Cort\u00e9s. The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936.

He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten (notably instead of Amun the temples of which he destroyed, the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources), which is sometimes described as monolatristic, henotheistic, or even quasi-monotheistic. An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars, and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god, giving the solar deity a status above mere gods. Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt\\'s traditional religion, but the shifts were not widely accepted. After his death, his monuments were dismantled and hidden, his statues were destroyed, and his name excluded from the king lists. Traditional religious practice was gradually restored, and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty, they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors, referring to Akhenaten himself as \"the enemy\" or \"that criminal\" in archival records. The stele of Merneptah, on the one hand, values Amun who is represented giving the cemetery of victory to Ramses III (Merneptah), on the other hand, is written on the back of a stele of Akhenaten stolen from one of his temples in Karnak. He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten, the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten, at Amarna. Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh, and a mummy found in the tomb KV55, which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton, is likely that of Akhenaten. DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun, but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned. Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun (even though Tutankhamun\\'s mother was not Nefertiti, but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady), partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized, and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish.'}, {'idx': 0, 'title': 'Meritaten', 'paragraph_text': 'Meritaten, also spelled Merytaten or Meryetaten (14th century BC), was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth dynasty.

Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard Marshal, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Henry supported his brother Richard of Cornwall in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund Crouchback on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. In 1263, one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death; however, he was not canonised.\"}, {'idx': 4, 'title': 'Edward I of England', 'paragraph_text': 'Edward I (17/18 June 1239 \u2013 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots , was King of England from 1272 to 1307. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father\\'s reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons\\' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward\\'s attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276\u201377, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282\u201383 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. The war that followed continued after Edward\\'s death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems. Edward I was a tall man (6\\'2\") for his era, hence the nickname \"Longshanks\". He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657.'}, {'idx': 9, 'title': 'Henry, son of Edward I', 'paragraph_text': 'Henry of England( 6 May 1268 \u2013 14 October 1274 in Merton, Surrey) was the fifth child and second son of Edward I of England by his first wife, Eleanor of Castile.'}]", "processed context": "[{'idx': 7, 'title': 'Henry III of England', 'paragraph_text': \"(Isabella of Angoul\u00eame), (Henry III), (1 October 1207), (16 November 1272), (Henry of Winchester), (King of England), (Ireland), (Duke of Aquitaine), (1216), (John), (Isabella), (Henry), (Guala), (Henry), (William Marshal), (Lincoln), (Sandwich), (1217), (Henry), (1225), (Hubert de Burgh), (Peter des Roches), (1230), (France), (William Marshal's), (Richard Marshal), (1232), (Church), (Henry), (England), (Henry), (Edward the Confessor), (Jews), (England), (Jews), (the Statute of Jewry), (France), (Poitou), (1242), (Battle of Taillebourg), (Henry), (Frederick II), (Holy Roman Emperor), (Henry), (Richard), (Cornwall), (Romans), (1256), (Edmund Crouchback), (Sicily), (Gascony), (1258), (Henry), (Poitevin), (Lusignans), (Eleanor), (Poitevins), (England), (Oxford), (Henry), (France), (1259), (Henry), (France), (King Louis), (Gascony), (Henry), (England), (1263), (Simon de Montfort), (the Second Barons' War), (Henry), (Louis), (The Battle of Lewes), (1264), (Henry), (Henry), (Edward), (the Battle of Evesham), (Henry), (Church), (Henry), (Jews), (Henry), (1272), (Edward), (Westminster Abbey), (the second half), (1290)\"}, {'idx': 4, 'title': 'Edward I of England', 'paragraph_text': \"(17/18 June 1239), (7 July 1307), (Edward Longshanks), (the Hammer of the Scots), (King of England), (1307), (Edward), (Henry III), (Edward), (1259), (Oxford), (the Second Barons' War), (the Battle of Lewes), (Edward), (a few months), (Simon de Montfort), (the Battle of Evesham), (1265), (two years), (England), (Edward), (Edward), (1272), (England), (1274), (Westminster Abbey), (19 August), (Edward), (Wales), (1276\u201377), (Edward), (1282\u201383), (Wales), (English), (English), (Scotland), (Edward), (Edward), (Edward), (France), (Scottish), (French), (Philip IV), (the Kingdom of England), (Edward), (Scotland), (the mid-1290s), (Edward), (1307), (Edward II), (Scotland), (Longshanks), (Edward), (Edward), (Henry III), (Parliament), (the Welsh and Scots), (the Edict of Expulsion), (1290), (Jews), (England), (over 350 years), (Oliver Cromwell), (1657)\"}, {'idx': 9, 'title': 'Henry, son of Edward I', 'paragraph_text': '(Henry of England), (6 May 1268), (14 October 1274), (Merton), (Surrey), (Edward I of), (England), (Eleanor of Castile)'}]", "response": "Answer: Isabella of Angoul\u00eame\nEvidence and explanation: The reasoning steps provided indicate that Henry III is the father of Edward I of England and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame is the mother of Henry III, making her the paternal grandmother of Edward I.\nStep by step with evidence and explanation:\n1.

He was the oldest son of Sackville Fox of East Horsley, Surrey, and his wife Ann Holloway. His father died in 1760 and left him his estate in Surrey, worth about \u00a31,300 per year. Educated at Marylebone School, he was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge in 1771 and studied there until 1774. On 22 February 1773, he inherited the Bramham Park, Yorkshire estate of his paternal uncle George Fox-Lane, 1st Baron Bingley, and subsequently took the name of Fox-Lane.

His works include: four novels; epic and lyric poetry; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; and treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him have survived. A literary celebrity by the age of 25 , Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, in 1782 after taking up residence in Weimar in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" (1774). He was an early participant in the \"Sturm und Drang\" literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe became a member of the Duke\\'s privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar\\'s botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace. Goethe\\'s first major scientific work, the \"Metamorphosis of Plants\", was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller\\'s death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, \"Wilhelm Meister\\'s Apprenticeship\"; the verse epic \"Hermann and Dorothea\", and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, \"Faust\". His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have come to be collectively termed Weimar Classicism. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer named \"Wilhelm Meister\\'s Apprenticeship\" one of the four greatest novels ever written, while the American philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six \"representative men\" in his work of the same name (along with Plato, Emanuel Swedenborg, Montaigne, Napoleon, and Shakespeare).

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby\\'s mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d\\'origineluogo d\\'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother\\'s or father\\'s place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder\\'s place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby\\'s parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant\\'s\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant\\'s\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

Following the war he wrote a famous and horrifying testimony. Graebe gave the following eyewitness account: My foreman and I went directly to the pits. Nobody bothered us. Now I heard rifle shots in quick succession from behind one of the earth mounds. The people who had got off the trucks- men, women and children of all ages- had to undress upon the order of an SS man who carried a riding or dog whip. They had to put down their clothes in fixed places, sorted according to shoes, top clothing and undergarments. I saw heaps of shoes of about 800 to 1000 pairs, great piles of under -linen and clothing. Without screaming or weeping these people undressed, stood around in family groups, kissed each other, said farewells, and waited for a sign from another SS man, who stood near the pit, also with a whip in his hand. During the fifteen minutes I stood near, I heard no complaint or plea for mercy. I watched a family of about eight persons, a man and a woman both of about fifty, with their children of about twenty to twenty- four, and two grown- up daughters about twenty- eight or twenty- nine. An old woman with snow white hair was holding a one- year- old child in her arms and singing to it and tickling it. The child was cooing with delight. The parents were looking on with tears in their eyes. The father was holding the hand of a boy about ten years old and speaking to him softly; the boy was fighting his tears. The father pointed to the sky, stroked his head and seemed to explain something to him. At that moment the SS man at the pit started shouting something to his comrade. The latter counted off about twenty persons and instructed them to go behind the earth mound. Among them was the family I have just mentioned. I well remember a girl, slim with black hair, who, as she passed me, pointed to herself and said,\" twenty- three years old.\" I walked around the mound and found myself confronted by a tremendous grave. People were closely wedged together and lying on top of each other so that only their heads were visible. Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders from their heads. Some of the people shot were still moving. Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads to show that they were still alive. The pit was nearly two- thirds full. I estimated that it already contained about a thousand people. I looked for the man who did the shooting. He was an SS man, who sat at the edge of the narrow end of the pit, his feet dangling into the pit. He had a tommy- gun on his knees and was smoking a cigarette. The people, completely naked, went down some steps which were cut in the clay wall of the pit and clambered over the heads of the people lying there to the place to which the SS man directed them. They lay down in front of the dead or wounded people; some caressed those who were still alive and spoke to them in a low voice. Then I heard a series of shots. I looked into the pit and saw that the bodies were twitching or the heads lying already motionless on top of the bodies that lay beneath them. Blood was running from their necks. The next batch was approaching already. They went down into the pit, lined themselves up against the previous victims and were shot. He later provided vital testimony in the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, invoking bitter persecution from many of his countrymen. To escape the hostility, Graebe moved his family to San Francisco in 1948, where he lived until his death in 1986. Hermann Graebe was honoured as a\\' Righteous Among the Nations\\' by Yad Vashem.

He was the foremost architect of his time in Scotland, designing and building numerous country houses and public buildings, and often acting as contractor as well as architect. Among his best known works are Hopetoun House near Edinburgh, and Duff House in Banff. His individual, exuberant style built on the Palladian style, but with Baroque details inspired by Vanbrugh and Continental architecture. In the 18th century, Adam was considered Scotland\\'s \"Universal Architect\". However, since the early 20th century, architectural critics have taken a more measured view, Colin McWilliam, for instance, finding the quality of his work \"varied to an extreme degree\". As well as being an architect, Adam was involved in several industrial ventures and improvement schemes, including coal mining, salt panning, stone quarries and mills. In 1731 he began to build up his own estate in Kinross-shire, which he named Blair Adam. He was the father of three architects; John, Robert and James, the last two were the developers of the \"Adam style\".'}, {'idx': 4, 'title': 'James Adam (architect)', 'paragraph_text': 'James Adam (21 July 1732 \u2013 20 October 1794) was a Scottish architect and furniture designer, but was often overshadowed by his older brother and business partner, Robert Adam. They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers\\' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert\\'s footsteps by undertaking the \"Grand Tour\", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King\\'s Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers\\' Adelphi project (1768\u20131772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739\u20131808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771\u20135 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire.

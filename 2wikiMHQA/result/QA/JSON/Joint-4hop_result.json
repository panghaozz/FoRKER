In 1942 he began to act in movies but also continued working on plays. He formed his own theater company and received awards for directing and writing. In the 1950s he began to direct movies, including the film of his novel, \"El viaje a ninguna parte\". He received praise for his 1958 comedy \"La vida por delante\", which led to a sequel, \"La vida alrededor\". In 1977, he won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival for his role in \"The Anchorite\".

Known as\" the Master of Suspense\", he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology\" Alfred Hitchcock Presents\"( 1955 \u2013 1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph- cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film\" The Pleasure Garden\"( 1925). His first successful film,( 1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film,\" Blackmail\", was the first British. Two of his 1930s thrillers,\" The 39 Steps\"( 1935) and\" The Lady Vanishes\"( 1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including\" Rebecca\"( 1940),\" Foreign Correspondent\"( 1940),\" Suspicion\"( 1941),\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943), and\" Notorious\"( 1946). \" Rebecca\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for\" Lifeboat\"( 1944) and\" Spellbound\"( 1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The\" Hitchcockian\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person\\'s gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film\" is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\" After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with\" Strangers on a Train\"( 1951) and\" Dial M For Murder\"( 1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time:\" Rear Window\"( 1954),\" Vertigo\"( 1958),\" North by Northwest\"( 1959), and\" Psycho\"( 1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012,\" Vertigo\" replaced Orson Welles\\'s\" Citizen Kane\"( 1941) as the British Film Institute\\'s greatest film ever made based on its world- wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite,\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943).

His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures, in particular homosexuality; as such, Van Sant is considered one of the most prominent auteurs of the New Queer Cinema movement. Van Sant\\'s early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the Pacific Northwest. He made his feature-length cinematic directorial debut with \"Mala Noche\" (1985). His second feature \"Drugstore Cowboy\" (1989) was highly acclaimed, and earned Van Sant screenwriting awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and New York Film Critics Circle and the award for Best Director from the National Society of Film Critics. His following film, \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991), was similarly praised, as was the black comedy \"To Die For\" (1995), the drama \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997), and the biographical film \"Milk\" (2008); for the latter two, Van Sant was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and both films received Best Picture nominations.

In addition to directing, Van Sant has written the screenplays for several of his earlier works, and is the author of a novel entitled \"Pink\".

The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike\\'s hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike\\'s mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy\\'s 1963 novel\" City of Night\" and concluding that Rechy\\'s treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott\\'s story as a modern update of the\" Henry IV\" plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other\\'s behalf. \" My Own Private Idaho\" had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of\" The New York Times\" and\" Entertainment Weekly\". The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics. \" My Own Private Idaho\" is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer- themed independent filmmaking. Since its 1991 release, the film has grown in popularity and been deemed as a cult classic, especially among LGBT audiences.

Curtiz was already a well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros. invited him to Hollywood in 1926, when he was 39 years of age. He had already directed 64 films in Europe, and soon helped Warner Bros. become the fastest-growing movie studio. He directed 102 films during his Hollywood career, mostly at Warners, where he directed ten actors to Oscar nominations. James Cagney and Joan Crawford won their only Academy Awards under Curtiz\\'s direction. He put Doris Day and John Garfield on screen for the first time, and he made stars of Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Bette Davis. He himself was nominated five times and won twice, once for Best Short Subject for \"Sons of Liberty\" and once as Best Director for \"Casablanca\".

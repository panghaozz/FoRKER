Question:Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?

Right Answer:yes
不进行反思
 Yes, more people today are related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar. Genghis Khan had sixteen children, and modern geneticists have determined that 1 out of every 200 men today has DNA that can be traced to him. In contrast, Julius Caesar had only three children, making it less likely for a large number of people today to be related to him.

Question:Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?

Right Answer:no
不进行反思
 No, a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar would not cheer up a depressed friend. Monoamine Oxidase breaks down neurotransmitters and lowers levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which are associated with depression. Therefore, consuming something that increases Monoamine Oxidase activity would likely worsen depression rather than improve it.

Question:Would it be impossible to use an Iwato scale for a twelve-tone technique composition?

Right Answer:yes
不进行反思
 No, it would not be impossible to use an Iwato scale for a twelve-tone technique composition. The twelve-tone technique typically involves using all 12 pitches of the chromatic scale, but a composer could incorporate the 5 pitches of the Iwato scale within a twelve-tone composition by using them as a subset or motif within the larger framework of the twelve-tone technique.

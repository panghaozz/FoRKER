Question:Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]
Step-by-step reasoning: [The context states that Genghis Khan had sixteen children, and modern geneticists have determined that 1 out of every 200 men today has DNA that can be traced to Genghis Khan. This indicates a significant genetic legacy. In contrast, Julius Caesar had only three children, which suggests a much smaller genetic impact. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that more people today are related to Genghis Khan than to Julius Caesar.]

Question:Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]
Step-by-step reasoning: [The context states that depression is caused by low levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) breaks down these neurotransmitters, further lowering their levels. Therefore, a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar would likely exacerbate the symptoms of depression rather than cheer up a depressed friend.]

Question:Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The context states that grey seals have no ear flaps and their ear canals are filled with wax, which suggests their hearing might be less sensitive compared to dogs.
2. Dogs have sensitive ears that can hear as far as a quarter of a mile away, indicating they have a strong auditory response.
3. Given that dogs have more sensitive hearing and grey seals' hearing is potentially less effective due to their ear structure, a dog would likely respond to a bell before a grey seal.
4. Therefore, the answer is [yes].

Question:Is a pound sterling valuable?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [yes]
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The context states that one pound sterling is worth about 1.24 US dollars by May of 2020. This indicates that the pound sterling has a measurable value in terms of another currency.
2. While the context mentions that fiat money (like the pound sterling) has no intrinsic value, it is still valuable because it is backed by government decree and is widely accepted as a medium of exchange.
3. Therefore, based on the exchange rate provided and the fact that it is a recognized and accepted currency, the pound sterling is considered valuable.

Since Albany, NY already has almost 100,000 people, it is already close to reaching that number. Albany, GA, with 75,000 people, would need to grow significantly to reach 100,000. Therefore, it is unlikely that Albany, GA will reach 100,000 occupants before Albany, NY.]

Question:Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?

1. The average cost of a US Boeing 737 plane is 1.6 million dollars.
2. Wonder Woman (2017 film) grossed over 800 million dollars at the box office.
3. Since 800 million dollars is significantly more than 1.6 million dollars, the box office receipts from Wonder Woman (2017 film) could easily cover the cost of a Boeing 737.

Question:Would a student of the class of 2017 have amnesia about 9/11?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. Students graduating high-school in 2017 would have been born in 1999 (from context idx 2).
2. 9/11 occurred in 2001 (from context idx 1), meaning these students would have been around 2 years old at the time.
3. Childhood amnesia typically affects memories before the age of 2 or 3 (from context idx 0).
4. Since 9/11 occurred when these students were around 2 years old, it is unlikely they would have amnesia about such a significant event, as it falls within the typical age range where memories start to form and be retained.
5. Therefore, a student of the class of 2017 would not have amnesia about 9/11.

Question:Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The question asks whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins.
2. The context provides information about greed, white-collar crime (which can be linked to greed), and gluttony (another of the Seven Deadly Sins).
3. While greed is described as a longing for wealth and power, and white-collar crime statistics (5-10% of arrests) suggest its prevalence, the context also mentions gluttony and provides a statistic (39.8% of US adults being overweight) that indicates gluttony is also highly prevalent.
4. Comparing the prevalence of greed (5-10% of arrests) and gluttony (39.8% of US adults), gluttony appears to be more prevalent based on the provided data.
5. Therefore, greed is not the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins in this context.

Question:Would the top of Mount Fuji stick out of the Sea of Japan? 

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The height of Mount Fuji is 3,776.24 meters (12,389.2 feet).
2. The maximum depth of the Sea of Japan is 3,742 meters (12,276 feet).
3. To determine if the top of Mount Fuji would stick out of the Sea of Japan, we compare its height to the maximum depth of the sea.
4. Since 3,776.24 meters (Mount Fuji's height) is greater than 3,742 meters (Sea of Japan's maximum depth), the top of Mount Fuji would indeed stick out of the Sea of Japan if it were placed at the deepest point.
5. However, the question asks if the top of Mount Fuji would stick out of the Sea of Japan, implying its current location. Mount Fuji is not located in the Sea of Japan but on Honshu Island, Japan.
6. Therefore, the answer is no, as Mount Fuji is not in the Sea of Japan.

However, the tibia itself is not specifically necessary to win the Stanley Cup. The Stanley Cup is awarded to the team that wins the National Hockey League championship, and while having functional legs (which include the tibia) is important for playing the sport, the tibia is not a unique or specific requirement for winning the trophy.

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The question asks if skin turning the color of a zombie could be due to nickel.
2. Zombies are often depicted as green in pallor (Context 0).
3. Nickel in jewelry often turns skin a greenish color (Context 1).

Question:Would a Dolce & Gabbana suit wearer be shunned by their Amish cousins?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. Dolce & Gabbana is a luxury fashion brand, which contrasts with the Amish values of simplicity and plainness in clothing.
2. The Amish frown upon buttons, and the Dolce & Gabbana suit mentioned has several buttons, which goes against Amish clothing norms.
3. The Amish practice shunning as a way to avoid interactions with those who do not adhere to their values, including those who wear clothing that contradicts their beliefs.
4. Therefore, a Dolce & Gabbana suit wearer would likely be shunned by their Amish cousins due to the clash in values and clothing practices.

Question:Would the Titanic be well preserved at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The context mentions that the bottom of the Gulf of Finland is one of the world's largest ship cemeteries, with ships being relatively well preserved due to low salinity, cold waters, and the absence of shipworms.
2. However, the Titanic did not sink in the Gulf of Finland. The Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean, which has different environmental conditions compared to the Gulf of Finland.
3. Therefore, the conditions that preserve ships in the Gulf of Finland do not apply to the Titanic, as it is located in a different body of water with different preservation factors.
4. Consequently, the Titanic would not be well preserved at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland because it is not located there.

Question:Would a Pict be confused by Old English?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The Picts were a Celtic-speaking people, as mentioned in context 1.
2. Old English was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, a Germanic tribe, as stated in context 0.
3. Gaelic and Old English are completely different languages from different branches of the Indo-European language family, as noted in context 3.
4. Gaelic vocabulary and verb conjugation are very different from Old English, as highlighted in context 4.
5. Since the Picts spoke a Celtic language (Pictish, which was replaced by Gaelic) and Old English is a Germanic language, the linguistic differences would likely cause confusion for a Pict encountering Old English.

Therefore, a Pict would likely be confused by Old English due to the significant linguistic differences between their native Celtic language and the Germanic Old English.

However, the number of children alone doesn't determine how many descendants exist today.\n   \n2. **Genetic Legacy**: Modern genetic studies indicate that a significant number of men today carry DNA that can be traced back to Genghis Khan. Specifically, it has been determined that about 1 in 200 men alive today has genetic links to him. This suggests a vast number of descendants due to Genghis Khan's extensive progeny and the historical context of his empire.\n\n3. **Comparison of Descendants**: While Julius Caesar had children, the number of descendants from him is likely much smaller because his lineage did not expand in the same way as Genghis Khan's. Genghis Khan's descendants are spread across a large population due to the historical spread of his empire and the practice of taking multiple wives.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the genetic evidence and the historical context, it is clear that more people today can trace their ancestry back to Genghis Khan than to Julius Caesar.", "EM pro correct": "False", "EM correct": "False"}

Genghis Khan is believed to have fathered a large number of children, and modern genetic studies indicate that approximately 1 in every 200 men alive today carries DNA that can be traced back to him. This suggests a widespread genetic legacy.  \n2. In contrast, Julius Caesar had three known children, which limits the number of direct descendants he could have.  \n3.

Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme that breaks down these neurotransmitters, leading to lower levels of them.

However, the question asks if it will be repainted only once during his first term, which is true, but considering the repainting schedule, it implies there is a possibility of more repaintings in the future after 2021.

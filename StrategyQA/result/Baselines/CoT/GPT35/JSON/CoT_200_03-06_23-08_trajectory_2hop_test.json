This larger number of children could suggest a greater potential for descendants.\n3. **Genetic Legacy of Genghis Khan**: The most significant point in the context is that modern geneticists have determined that out of every 200 men today, one can trace their DNA back to Genghis Khan. This indicates a vast number of modern individuals carry genetic material linked to him.\n4. **Comparison**: Given that Genghis Khan's genetic legacy is quantifiable and widespread in the current population, while Julius Caesar's lineage is limited to a smaller number of offspring, it follows that more people today are related to Genghis Khan than to Julius Caesar. \n\nThus, based on the context provided, it is clear that Genghis Khan has a broader genetic impact on the modern population compared to Julius Caesar.", "EM pro correct": "True", "EM correct": "False"}

Dogs have highly sensitive ears that can detect sounds from a distance of up to a quarter of a mile. This sensitivity allows them to respond quickly to auditory stimuli, such as a bell.\n2. In contrast, grey seals do not have external ear flaps, and their ear canals are filled with wax, which can affect their ability to hear sounds in the air compared to dogs. \n3.

However, its value comes from the trust and confidence that people have in the issuing government and the economy.\n\n3. **Exchange Rate**: The third piece of context provides a specific value for the pound sterling, stating that it was worth about 1.24 US dollars in May 2020. This exchange rate indicates that the pound has a significant value compared to another major currency.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: While the pound sterling is fiat money and does not have intrinsic value, it is still considered valuable due to its acceptance in trade and its exchange rate against other currencies.

Question:Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. Genghis Khan is believed to have fathered a large number of children, and modern genetic studies indicate that approximately 1 in every 200 men alive today carries DNA that can be traced back to him. This suggests a widespread genetic legacy.  
2. In contrast, Julius Caesar had three known children, which limits the number of direct descendants he could have.  
3. Given the genetic evidence indicating a significant number of descendants from Genghis Khan compared to the very limited lineage from Julius Caesar, it is reasonable to conclude that more people today are related to Genghis Khan than to Julius Caesar.  
4. Thus, the answer to the question is yes.

Question:Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The claim suggests that a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar would cheer up a depressed friend. However, the context indicates that depression is linked to low levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which are neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation. Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme that breaks down these neurotransmitters, leading to lower levels of them. Therefore, consuming something that affects MAO would likely decrease the levels of these mood-regulating neurotransmitters further, rather than helping to cheer someone up. Hence, a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar would not be beneficial for someone who is depressed.

Question:Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The context provides information about both dogs and grey seals. It states that dogs have sensitive ears and can hear sounds from a considerable distance (up to a quarter of a mile). 2. In contrast, grey seals have no ear flaps and their ear canals are filled with wax, which may limit their hearing capabilities. 3. Given that dogs have a more acute sense of hearing compared to grey seals, it is likely that a dog would respond to a bell before a grey seal would. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Question:Is a pound sterling valuable?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The claim asks if a pound sterling is valuable. Although it is fiat money, which means it is not backed by a physical commodity and has no intrinsic value, its value is determined by what people are willing to exchange it for. The context states that one pound sterling was worth about 1.24 US dollars in May 2020, indicating that it does have a market value. Therefore, despite being fiat money, the pound sterling holds value in terms of exchange rates and purchasing power, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed valuable.

Question:Is shrimp scampi definitely free of plastic?

Right Answer:no

Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. The claim is about whether shrimp scampi is definitely free of plastic.  
2. The context states that shrimp have been found to contain microplastics (Context 1).  
3. Microplastics are identified as plastic material (Context 2).  
4. Since shrimp can contain microplastics, it implies that shrimp scampi, which is made from shrimp, may also contain plastic.  
5. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that shrimp scampi is free of plastic.  
6. The conclusion is that shrimp scampi is not definitely free of plastic.

Question:Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. The average cost of a US Boeing 737 is stated to be 1.6 million dollars.  
2. The box office receipts for Wonder Woman (2017) grossed over 800 million dollars.  
3. To determine if the cost of a Boeing 737 is covered by the box office receipts, we compare 1.6 million dollars to 800 million dollars.  
4. Since 800 million dollars is significantly greater than 1.6 million dollars, the cost of a Boeing 737 is indeed covered by the box office receipts of Wonder Woman (2017).  
5. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.

Step-by-step reasoning: Christmas trees are typically made from pine trees, which are coniferous and keep their needles year-round. In contrast, deciduous trees lose their leaves in the fall. This fundamental difference in leaf retention and type (needles vs. broad leaves) indicates that Christmas trees (coniferous) are indeed dissimilar to deciduous trees.

2. The context also states that the Democratic base is largely pro-choice, which suggests that Pelosi would align with the views of her party.

Question:Does Dragon Ball shows and movies fall short of Friday 13th number of projects?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine if Dragon Ball shows and movies fall short of Friday the 13th's number of projects, we need to count the total projects for both franchises. 

For Dragon Ball:
- TV series: 6
- TV specials: 3
- Direct to video spinoffs: 2
Total for Dragon Ball = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 projects.

For Friday the 13th:
- Movies: 12
- TV series: 1
Total for Friday the 13th = 12 + 1 = 13 projects.

Now, we compare the totals:
- Dragon Ball has 11 projects.
- Friday the 13th has 13 projects.

Since 11 is less than 13, Dragon Ball does fall short of Friday the 13th's number of projects. However, the question asks if Dragon Ball shows and movies fall short of Friday the 13th, which implies a comparison. Since Dragon Ball has fewer projects, the answer to the question is "no," as it does not exceed or match the number of projects in the Friday the 13th franchise.

Question:Would a student of the class of 2017 have amnesia about 9/11?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. 9/11 occurred in 2001.  
2. A student graduating high school in 2017 would typically have been born in 1999.  
3. This means that the student would have been approximately 2 years old during the 9/11 attacks.  
4. Childhood amnesia often results in individuals not remembering events that happened before the age of 3.  
5. Therefore, it is likely that a student from the class of 2017 would not have any memory of the 9/11 attacks due to their young age at the time and the effects of childhood amnesia.  
6. Thus, the answer to the question is yes, a student of the class of 2017 would likely have amnesia about 9/11.

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The claim asks whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. While the context provided mentions greed and its association with white-collar crime, it does not provide evidence or statistics indicating that greed is more prevalent than the other deadly sins. Additionally, the context discusses other sins, such as gluttony, and provides statistics related to it. Without specific evidence showing that greed is the most prevalent sin compared to the others, we cannot conclude that it is the most prevalent. Therefore, the answer is no.

Question:Could George Washington's own speeches have been recorded live to a compact disc?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: George Washington died in 1799, which means he could not have made any speeches that could be recorded on a compact disc. Additionally, compact discs were not invented until 1982, long after Washington's time. Therefore, it is impossible for his speeches to have been recorded live to a compact disc.

Question:Would food made with black salt smell of sulfur?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. The first context states that black salt contains sulfur, which is a key component that can contribute to its smell.  
2. The second context mentions that when black salt is cooked, it smells similar to rotten eggs.  
3. The third context explains that rotten eggs have a distinct sulfur smell.  
4. Since black salt contains sulfur and produces a smell akin to rotten eggs when cooked, it follows that food made with black salt would indeed smell of sulfur.  
Thus, the answer is [yes].

Question:Would a broadcast from Spirit make the news in 2020?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The context indicates that Spirit, the Mars rover, sent its final transmission in 2010. Since there were no new broadcasts from Spirit after that year, there would be no broadcast from Spirit to make news in 2020. Additionally, the mention of another rover making news in 2019 does not pertain to Spirit and further confirms that Spirit's communications ceased long before 2020. Therefore, a broadcast from Spirit would not have made the news in 2020.

Question:Could Robert Wadlow hypothetically see Frankenstein's monster's bald spot from above?

Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning: Robert Wadlow was 8 feet 11.1 inches tall, making him taller than Frankenstein's monster, which was said to be 8 feet tall. Given that Wadlow was taller, he would have a vantage point above the monster, allowing him to see the monster's bald spot if it were visible from that height.

Question:Is the tibia necessary to win the Stanley Cup?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The tibia is a leg bone, and while legs are necessary for skating in ice hockey, the specific bone (tibia) is not necessary to win the Stanley Cup. Players can compete and win without a tibia, as other bones and muscles can compensate for its function. Winning the Stanley Cup is dependent on the team's overall performance and skill, not the presence of a specific bone in an individual player.

Question:Would an ethics professor teach a class on Cezanne?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning: An ethics professor may teach a class on Cezanne if the class involves discussions on aesthetics, which is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of art and beauty. Since Cezanne is an Impressionist painter, studying his work could fall under the umbrella of aesthetics. Therefore, it is plausible for an ethics professor to include Cezanne in their curriculum, especially if the focus is on the ethical implications of art or the philosophical aspects of artistic expression.

Question:If you add water to rice pudding is it horchata?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: Horchata is a drink made from soaking dry rice in water, then pulverizing and straining it, often with added spices and sweeteners. In contrast, rice pudding is a dessert that includes cooked rice, eggs, and other ingredients. Adding water to rice pudding does not transform it into horchata, as the preparation methods and ingredients are fundamentally different. Therefore, adding water to rice pudding does not make it horchata.

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The question asks if skin turning the color of a zombie could be due to nickel. The context provided indicates that zombies are often depicted as having a green pallor, and it also states that nickel in jewelry can turn skin a greenish color. Since both pieces of information align, it is reasonable to conclude that skin turning a zombie-like color could indeed be attributed to nickel causing a greenish tint.

Question:Would a Dolce & Gabbana suit wearer be shunned by their Amish cousins?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The Amish community values plain and simple clothing, avoiding adornments like buttons, which are frowned upon. 2. A Dolce & Gabbana suit, being a luxury fashion item, typically includes several buttons and is not plain or simple. 3. Since the Amish have strict guidelines regarding attire and consider those who do not adhere to their values as "sinners," they may choose to shun individuals who wear extravagant clothing such as a Dolce & Gabbana suit. 4. Therefore, it is likely that a wearer of such a suit would be shunned by their Amish cousins.

Question:Can a strawberry get worms similar to dogs?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. The question asks if a strawberry can get worms similar to dogs.  
2. The context mentions that strawberries can suffer from nematodes, which are a type of parasite.  
3. It also states that dogs can suffer from various types of worms, including roundworms.  
4. However, the worms that affect dogs and the nematodes that affect strawberries are not the same.  
5. The context indicates that nematodes are specific parasites that feed on strawberry plants, while dogs are affected by different types of worms.  
6. Thus, while both strawberries and dogs can be affected by parasites, the nature of the worms is different.  
7. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, a strawberry cannot get worms similar to dogs.

The context provided mentions that Italian wedding soup contains large chunks, including meatballs and pasta, which require chewing. Similarly, chicken noodle soup has chunks of chicken and large noodles that also require chewing. Since both soups contain solid components that are not suitable for a liquid diet, it is true that there are some types of soup you cannot eat while on a liquid diet.

Step-by-step reasoning: The question asks if any country involved in the Portuguese Colonial War had a role similar to Switzerland's neutrality during World War II. The context indicates that Portugal, which was involved in the Portuguese Colonial War, remained neutral during World War II, similar to Switzerland. However, the question specifically asks about sharing Switzerland's role, implying that we are looking for another country that acted similarly during both conflicts. The context does not provide information about any other country in the Portuguese Colonial War that had a neutral role in WWII, thus leading to the conclusion that no such country exists. Therefore, the answer is [no].

Question:Would a Pict be confused by Old English?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. The Picts spoke a Celtic language, while Old English was a Germanic language spoken by the Anglo-Saxons.
2. The Pictish language died out and was replaced by Gaelic, which is also a Celtic language.
3. Old English and Gaelic are from different branches of the Indo-European language family, indicating significant linguistic differences.
4. Since Old English and the languages spoken by the Picts (Celtic and later Gaelic) are fundamentally different, a Pict would likely find Old English confusing due to these differences in vocabulary, grammar, and linguistic structure.  
5. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a Pict would be confused by Old English.

Question:Did Japanese serfdom have higher status than English counterpart?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. The context mentions that serfs in Medieval England were indentured servants with little legal recourse, indicating a lower status.
2. It describes Japanese serfs as farmers and fishermen who produced food essential for all classes, which implies they had a recognized role in society.
3. However, the context does not provide evidence that Japanese serfs had a higher status than their English counterparts; rather, it highlights their essential role in food production without comparing their overall societal status directly.
4. Therefore, while Japanese serfs may have had a respected role due to their contributions, this does not necessarily equate to a higher status than English serfs, who were also in a subservient position.  
5. Based on the available information, it is reasonable to conclude that Japanese serfdom did not have a higher status than the English counterpart.

Question:Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?

Right Answer:no

Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. Lil Wayne began his career in 1995 at the age of 12 (Context 0).  
2. To legally operate a vehicle on his own in the USA, a person must have a driver's license (Context 1).  
3. The minimum age to obtain a driver's license varies by state, but generally, a 12-year-old would not be eligible to obtain a driver's license in any state (Context 2).  
4. Therefore, since Lil Wayne was only 12 years old at the beginning of his career, he would not have been able to legally operate a vehicle on his own.

Question:Could an ocelot subsist on a single bee hummingbird per day?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: An ocelot requires between 600–800 grams of food each day to meet its energy needs. In contrast, a bee hummingbird weighs only about 2-3 grams. If an ocelot were to subsist on a single bee hummingbird per day, it would receive only a tiny fraction of the required daily caloric intake, which is insufficient for its survival. Therefore, the answer is no, an ocelot could not subsist on a single bee hummingbird per day.

Question:Does Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church recognize Alexander Nevsky as a saint?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. Alexander Nevsky was canonized as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1547.  
2. The Russian Orthodox Church is part of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which has its own distinct list of saints.  
3. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is a branch of the Catholic Church, which has been in schism with the Eastern Orthodox Church since the East-West Schism of 1054.  
4. Because of this schism and the differences in the recognition of saints between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church does not recognize Alexander Nevsky as a saint.  
5. Therefore, the answer to the question is "no."

Question:Was the original James Bond actor born near the Washington Monument?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The original James Bond actor, Sean Connery, was born in Scotland. The Washington Monument is located in Washington, D.C. Since Scotland and Washington, D.C. are nearly 3,500 miles apart, it is clear that Sean Connery was not born near the Washington Monument.

Question:Are any animals in Chinese calendar Chordata?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. The question asks if any animals in the Chinese calendar are classified as Chordata.
2. The context provides information about the Chinese zodiac, which includes animals such as dogs and pigs.
3. It is stated that "Chordata is a scientific classification of an animals phylum," meaning that it encompasses a wide range of animals including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish.
4. Specifically, the context mentions that "The phylum of pigs is Chordata."
5. Since pigs (and likely other animals in the Chinese zodiac) fall under the phylum Chordata, it can be concluded that there are indeed animals in the Chinese calendar that are classified as Chordata.
6. Therefore, the answer to the question is [yes].

Question:Was a person sold a Creative Commons License for Boticelli's The Birth of Venus ripped off?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. **Understanding Creative Commons License**: A Creative Commons license allows for the free distribution of copyrighted works. If a work is under this license, it is not owned by any one person and can be used freely by others.
2. **Public Domain Works**: Works that are in the public domain do not require permission for use. This means anyone can use them without any legal repercussions.
3. **Public Domain Criteria**: According to the context provided, any work created before 1923 is in the public domain. 
4. **The Birth of Venus**: Sandro Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus" was created in 1486, which is well before 1923. Therefore, it is in the public domain.
5. **Conclusion**: If someone was sold a Creative Commons license for "The Birth of Venus," they were misled because the painting is in the public domain and does not require a license for use. Hence, they were "ripped off."

Question:Does Northern fur seal make good pet for six year old?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: Northern fur seals are large marine mammals that can weigh up to 120 pounds, which is significantly heavier than an average six-year-old child who weighs around 45 pounds. Their size alone makes them unsuitable as pets for young children. Additionally, Northern fur seals have sharp canine teeth, which poses a risk of injury. They are also wild animals that require specific habitats and diets, making them impractical and unsafe as pets for a child. Therefore, a Northern fur seal would not make a good pet for a six-year-old.

Question:Would a pear sink in water?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The density of a raw pear is approximately 0.59 g/cm³, while the density of water is about 1 g/cm³. Since the density of the pear is less than that of water, it will not sink. Objects only sink if they are denser than the surrounding fluid, which is not the case here. Therefore, a pear would float in water.

Question:Could Scooby Doo fit in a kangaroo pouch?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: Scooby Doo is a fictional Great Dane, which typically measures 30-34 inches in height. In contrast, kangaroo pouches are designed to carry very young kangaroo babies, which are significantly smaller than adult animals. A 10-week-old kangaroo is much smaller than a Great Dane, indicating that an adult Great Dane like Scooby Doo would not fit into a kangaroo's pouch. Therefore, the answer is no.

Question:Is the kayak a traditional boat in New Zealand?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. The context mentions that kayaks were developed by native peoples in northern regions, specifically the Arctic and surrounding areas. This suggests that their origins are not linked to New Zealand.
2. The context also states that the native Maori people of New Zealand arrived in canoes, indicating that canoes are the traditional boats associated with Maori culture, not kayaks.
3. Given that kayaks are not mentioned as part of the traditional boating practices of the Maori or as a traditional boat in New Zealand, the conclusion is that kayaks are not a traditional boat in New Zealand.

Question:Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine if ten gallons of seawater could crush a six-year-old, we first need to calculate the total weight of the seawater. One gallon of seawater weighs slightly over 8 pounds. Therefore, ten gallons would weigh approximately 10 x 8 = 80 pounds. The average weight of a six-year-old is around 45 pounds. Since 80 pounds (the weight of the seawater) is significantly greater than 45 pounds (the weight of the child), it is reasonable to conclude that ten gallons of seawater could indeed crush a six-year-old.

Question:Is there a full Neptunian orbit between the first two burials of women in the Panthéon?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [yes]  
Step-by-step reasoning:  
1. Sophie Berthelot was the first woman interred in the Panthéon in 1907.  
2. Marie Curie was the second woman interred there in 1995.  
3. The time taken for Neptune to complete one full orbit around the sun is 165 years.  
4. The time between the two burials (from 1907 to 1995) is 88 years.  
5. Since 88 years is less than 165 years, there is not a full Neptunian orbit between the first two burials of women in the Panthéon.  
6. Thus, the answer to the question is [yes], indicating that there is a full Neptunian orbit between the two burials.

Question:Will Tokyo Tower be repainted only once during President Trump's first term?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: Tokyo Tower is repainted every five years. The last repainting began in 2018, which means the next repainting would be scheduled for 2023. Since President Trump's first term was from 2017 to 2021, only one repainting (the one that began in 2018) would occur during this term. However, the question asks if it will be repainted only once during his first term, which is true, but considering the repainting schedule, it implies there is a possibility of more repaintings in the future after 2021. Therefore, the answer is no, it will not be repainted only once during Trump's first term, as the repainting that began in 2018 is the only one that falls within that timeframe.

Question:Has a neanderthal ever served on the Supreme Court of the United States?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: Neanderthals lived around 40,000 years ago, long before the establishment of the Supreme Court in 1789. Given that Neanderthals are an extinct species of primitive humans and the Supreme Court is a modern institution, it is impossible for a Neanderthal to have ever served on the Supreme Court.

Question:Can Clouded leopards chase down many Pronghorn antelopes?

Right Answer:no
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The top speed of a Clouded leopard is 40 MPH, while the top speed of a Pronghorn antelope is 61 MPH. Since the Pronghorn is faster than the Clouded leopard, the leopard would not be able to chase down many Pronghorn antelopes successfully.

Question:Can voice actors for Goofy and Bugs Bunny each get one stripe from American flag?

Right Answer:yes
Answer: [no]  
Step-by-step reasoning: The question asks if voice actors for Goofy and Bugs Bunny can each get one stripe from the American flag. The context states that the American flag has 13 stripes, which means that stripes are not awarded to individuals but are a fixed part of the flag's design. Therefore, voice actors cannot receive stripes from the flag as it is not a system of awards or recognition. Hence, the answer is no.

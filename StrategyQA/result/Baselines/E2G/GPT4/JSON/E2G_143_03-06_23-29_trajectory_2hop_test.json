Julius Caesar had three children, which provides a limited base for descendants (Evidence from context [0]).\n2. Genghis Khan, on the other hand, had sixteen children and many descendants (Evidence from context [1]).\n3. Modern genetic studies reveal that approximately 0.5% of men alive today carry DNA that can be traced back to Genghis Khan, equating to roughly 1 in 200 men (Evidence from context [2]).\n4.

Since depression is linked to low levels of these neurotransmitters, consuming something that breaks them down would not be beneficial.  \nStep by step with evidence and explanation:  \n1. **Understanding Depression**: The context states that depression is caused by low levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (Context 0). This indicates that these neurotransmitters are crucial for mood regulation.  \n2. **Function of Monoamine Oxidase**: The second piece of context explains that Monoamine Oxidase breaks down neurotransmitters, thereby lowering the levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (Context 1).  \n3. **Implication of Consuming MAO**: If a candy bar contains Monoamine Oxidase, it would contribute to the breakdown of these important neurotransmitters, potentially worsening the mood of someone who is already depressed.  \n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, giving a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar to a depressed friend would not cheer them up; instead, it could have the opposite effect by further lowering their mood-regulating neurotransmitters.

Therefore, it is likely that a dog would respond to a bell before a grey seal would.  \nStep by step with evidence and explanation:  \n1. **Understanding the hearing capabilities**: The context states that dogs have sensitive ears and can hear sounds from a distance of up to a quarter of a mile. This indicates that dogs are very responsive to sounds in their environment.  \n2. **Comparing with grey seals**: The context also mentions that grey seals have no ear flaps and their ear canals are filled with wax, which suggests that their hearing may not be as effective in air compared to dogs.  \n3. **Hearing in different environments**: While grey seals can hear better underwater, the question pertains to their ability to hear a bell, which is typically an air-borne sound.

Therefore, Dragon Ball does not fall short of the number of projects compared to Friday the 13th.  \nStep by step with evidence and explanation:  \n1. Count the number of projects for Dragon Ball:  \n   - 6 TV series  \n   - 3 TV specials  \n   - 2 direct to video spinoffs  \n   Total for Dragon Ball = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 projects.  \n\n2. Count the number of projects for Friday the 13th:  \n   - 12 movies  \n   - 1 TV series  \n   Total for Friday the 13th = 12 + 1 = 13 projects.  \n\n3. Compare the totals:  \n   - Dragon Ball has 11 projects.  \n   - Friday the 13th has 13 projects.  \n\n4. Conclusion: Since 11 (Dragon Ball) is less than 13 (Friday the 13th), Dragon Ball does fall short of the number of projects. However, the question asks if it falls short, which is a yes/no question.

The practice of hot reading is considered deception within the psychic community (Context 1).

The context mentions that strawberries can suffer from nematodes, which are a type of parasite. This is supported by the statement in the context that \"Nematodes are parasites that feed off of strawberry plants.\"  \n2. Nematodes are also referred to as roundworms, which aligns with the type of worms that dogs can get, as mentioned in the context.  \n3.

A six-year-old child typically weighs around 45 pounds, while an adult Northern fur seal can weigh up to 120 pounds, making them significantly larger than a child. Additionally, they have sharp canine teeth that can pose a danger.  \n\nStep by step with evidence and explanation:  \n1. Consider the weight difference: A six-year-old weighs approximately 45 pounds (Context 0), and an adult Northern fur seal weighs as much as 120 pounds (Context 1). This size difference indicates that the seal could inadvertently harm the child.  \n2. Analyze physical attributes: Northern fur seals have sharp canine teeth (Context 2), which are designed for tearing food. This suggests they have the potential to cause injury, whether intentionally or accidentally.  \n3. Evaluate living conditions: Northern fur seals live near rivers and primarily feed off fish populations (Context 3), indicating they have specific habitat and dietary requirements that cannot be met in a home environment.  \n4. Combine these factors: Considering their size, potential for harm, and specific care requirements, it is clear that Northern fur seals are not appropriate pets for a young child.  \nThus, the answer to the question is [no].", "EM pro correct": "True", "EM correct": "True"}

Groundhog Day involves a groundhog seeing its shadow, which is essential for the tradition (Context 0).  \n2. Antarctica experiences irregular sun patterns, including days with no sunrise and periods of 24-hour sunlight (Context 1). This means that the concept of a shadow, which is crucial for Groundhog Day, would not function properly in such conditions.  \n3.

The formation of callouses involves layers of dead skin that usually lack sensation, which contributes to a guitarist's ability to handle pain better than someone without such callouses.  \nStep by step with evidence and explanation: 1. Observing that guitarists typically have calloused fingertips (context[0]), we understand that this adaptation occurs due to repeated friction and pressure on their fingers from playing the guitar.  \n2.

The foot is explicitly mentioned as part of the American standard system of measurement (as stated in the second context).  \n3. Since the foot belongs to a different measurement system (the American standard system) and not the metric system, the answer to the question is no.", "EM pro correct": "True", "EM correct": "True"}

Therefore, it would not be typical for an anchor to greet viewers in Japanese with \"Konnichiwa.\"  \nStep by step with evidence and explanation:  \n1. The context states that \"Konnichiwa is a greeting in the Japanese language,\" which indicates that it is not a common greeting in Brazil.  \n2. The context also mentions that \"The national language of Brazil is Portuguese,\" which implies that Brazilian television anchors, including those on Rede Globo, typically communicate in Portuguese.  \n3. Since \"Konnichiwa\" is a Japanese greeting and not Portuguese, it would be unusual for a Rede Globo anchor to use it in their broadcasts.  \n4.

The context states that \"The Descendants Trilogy is a series of musical movies that aired on Disney Channel between 2015 and 2019.\" This establishes that the Descendants movies are indeed Disney Channel musical movies.  \n2. The second piece of context mentions that \"Hades appears as a supporting character in the third Descendants movie.\" This directly confirms Hades' presence in one of the Disney Channel musical movies.  \n3.

This indicates that weather phenomena were not avoided when naming these teams.  \nStep by step with evidence and explanation:  \n1. The first piece of context defines weather phenomena as types of weather caused by conditions such as cyclones, storms, and tsunamis. This establishes what is meant by \"weather phenomena.\"  \n2. The second piece of context lists specific minor league baseball teams, including the Brooklyn Cyclones and Lake Elsinore Storm. Both of these names directly reference weather phenomena (cyclones and storms).  \n3. Since these teams have names that include weather phenomena, it is clear that such phenomena were not avoided in the naming process.  \n4.

This shell can potentially deflect projectiles, as evidenced by instances where humans have been injured by bullets ricocheting off an armadillo's shell. Therefore, it is theoretically possible to use an armadillo as a shield.  \nStep by step with evidence and explanation:  \n1. Armadillos possess a hard shell made of dermal bone (Context 0), which indicates they have a form of armor.  \n2. The fact that humans have been hospitalized due to bullets ricocheting off an armadillo's shell (Context 1) suggests that the shell can withstand some level of impact.  \n3. Given these two points, it can be concluded that an armadillo's shell could theoretically provide some protection against projectiles, supporting the idea of using it as a shield.  \n4.

Question:Eric Ambler and Carol Shields are both best Known for what profession?
Right Answer:author
进行反思
 The previous reasoning failed because the answer "writing" was too general and did not specifically identify the profession of "novelist" or "author" for both Eric Ambler and Carol Shields. To mitigate similar failures, it's important to ensure that the answer is specific and directly matches the profession mentioned in the supporting contexts. A high-level plan would include carefully identifying the specific profession mentioned in the contexts and ensuring that the answer is precise and matches the context provided.

Question:Which band has more members, Test Icicles or X Ambassadors?
Right Answer:X Ambassadors
进行反思
Reflexion: The previous reasoning failed because the focus was solely on identifying the band with more members, rather than comparing the member counts between Test Icicles and X Ambassadors directly. To improve, the comparison should directly assess the number of members in each band, not assume based on the presence of one band in the context. A high-level plan would involve directly counting and comparing the members of both bands mentioned.
Answer: X Ambassadors
Evidence and explanation: X Ambassadors consist of lead vocalist Sam Harris, keyboardist Casey Harris, lead guitarist Noah Feldshuh, and drummer Adam Levin as mentioned in the context. This provides the direct count of members in X Ambassadors.
Step by step with evidence and explanation: 
1. Test Icicles is mentioned in the context but does not list the number of members explicitly.
2. X Ambassadors, on the other hand, is clearly stated to consist of four members: Sam Harris, Casey Harris, Noah Feldshuh, and Adam Levin.
3. By directly comparing the member count listed for X Ambassadors with the lack of specific member count for Test Icicles, it is clear that X Ambassadors has more members than Test Icicles.

Question:How long is the river for which Frenchmans Creek is a tributary?
Right Answer:2844 km
进行反思
Reflexion: The previous reasoning failed because the answer provided was the length of the Darling River, 1472 km, instead of the length of the river for which Frenchmans Creek is a tributary. The misinterpretation likely arose from not directly addressing the specific river length in question. To avoid similar mistakes, it is crucial to pay close attention to the specific details requested in the claim and not generalize based on related information. A high-level plan to prevent such errors would involve focusing on the precise details sought in the claim and avoiding assumptions or extrapolations.

Answer: 2844 km
Evidence and explanation: The Supporting Contexts state that the Darling River is 1472 km long and that, including its tributaries, it is 2844 km long. As Frenchmans Creek is a tributary of the Darling River, the length of the river for which Frenchmans Creek is a tributary would be 2844 km.
Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The claim is specifically asking for the length of the river that Frenchmans Creek is a tributary of.
2. From the context, it is mentioned that Frenchmans Creek is a tributary of the Darling River.
3. The context also states that including its tributaries, the Darling River is 2844 km long.
4. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2844 km, which is the length of the river for which Frenchmans Creek is a tributary.

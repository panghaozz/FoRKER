Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy
Evidence and explanation: The contexts provided do not contain specific numbers of instruments or people for either Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice, making it impossible to calculate an exact instrument to person ratio.
Step by step with evidence and explanation: 1. The claim asks for a comparison of the instrument to person ratio between Badly Drawn Boy and Wolf Alice. 2. Context index 2 and 8 mention Badly Drawn Boy, which is the stage name for a single individual, Damon Gough. 3. Context index 0 mentions Wolf Alice, which consists of four members: Ellie Rowsell, Joff Oddie, Theo Ellis, Joel Amey. 4. Since Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act, the instrument to person ratio would be the number of instruments he plays to one (himself), which could potentially be higher than a four-member band where the number of instruments is likely less than four times the number of band members. 5. Therefore, without specific numbers, we can infer that Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio because he is a solo act, whereas Wolf Alice is a group of four.

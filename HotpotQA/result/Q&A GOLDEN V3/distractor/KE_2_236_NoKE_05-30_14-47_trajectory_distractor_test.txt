Question:Are  Chrysalis and Look both women's magazines?
Right Answer:yes
Question: Are Chrysalis and Look both women's magazines?

Answer: No

Evidence and explanation:
The provided context indicates that Chrysalis was a feminist magazine focused on women's culture, while Look is a fashion and celebrity magazine for young women. The key differences are:

1. Chrysalis was a feminist publication that covered a broad range of topics like politics, literature, cultural studies, and art. It was produced through a collective process and featured contributions from notable feminist writers and intellectuals.

2. Look, on the other hand, is described as a "glossy high street fashion and celebrity weekly magazine for young women" that focuses on fashion, shopping, celebrity news, and real-life stories. It has a more mainstream, commercial focus compared to the feminist orientation of Chrysalis.

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The question asks whether Chrysalis and Look are both women's magazines.
2. From the context, we learn that Chrysalis was a feminist publication that covered a wide range of topics relevant to women's culture and the feminist movement. 
3. In contrast, Look is described as a fashion and celebrity magazine targeting young women, with a focus on more mainstream topics like fashion, shopping, and celebrity news.
4. Given the differences in the editorial focus, target audience, and overall orientation between the two magazines, the evidence suggests that they cannot both be considered "women's magazines" in the same sense. 
5. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, Chrysalis and Look are not both women's magazines.

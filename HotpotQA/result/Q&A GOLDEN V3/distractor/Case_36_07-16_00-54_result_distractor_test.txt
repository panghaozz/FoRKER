进行反思
 The previous reasoning failed because it did not correctly identify the specific end date of the civil war that led to the defeat and destruction of Alexander Kerensky by the Bolsheviks. The error occurred due to a misunderstanding of the context provided, which mentioned multiple end dates for different aspects of the war. To mitigate similar failures, it's important to ensure accurate identification of the specific event and its corresponding date within the context provided. A high-level plan would include double-checking the specific event and its date within the context.
 January 1918

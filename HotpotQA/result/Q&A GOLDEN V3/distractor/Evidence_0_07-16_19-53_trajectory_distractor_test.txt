Answer: Badly Drawn Boy

Evidence: Damon Gough, who performs as Badly Drawn Boy, is a multi-instrumentalist and played several instruments on his album.

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The question asks for the performance act with a higher instrument to person ratio between Badly Drawn Boy and Wolf Alice.

The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version). As a result, the track listing for \"Mono Masters\" differs from \"Past Masters\" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (\"Old Brown Shoe\", \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Let It Be\"), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes. Tracks 9\u201312 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7\" mono \"Yellow Submarine\" EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered. Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or \"fold-down\", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased. \"Get Back\" (with B-side \"Don\\'t Let Me Down\") was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format. It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo. Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release.'}]", "processed context": "[{'idx': 7, 'title': 'To Know Him Is to Love Him', 'paragraph_text': '(Phil Spector), (Love Him), (Phil Spector), (three weeks), (the \"Billboard\" Hot), (1958), (UK), (New Musical Express), (Peter & Gordon), (Bobby Vinton), (Love), (1987), (Dolly Parton), (Linda Ronstadt), (Emmylou Harris), (U.S.)'}, {'idx': 5, 'title': 'Back to Mono (1958\u20131969)', 'paragraph_text': '(Phil Spector), (Phil Spector), (the 1960s), (1991), (ABKCO), (Love Him), (1958), (Spector), (Spector), (Tom Wolfe), (The First Tycoon of Teen)'}, {'idx': 4, 'title': 'Mono Masters', 'paragraph_text': '(Mono Masters), (Beatles), (The Beatles in Mono), (\"Past Masters), (the second half), (The Ballad of John and Yoko), (March 1969), (Yellow Submarine\" EP), (two months), (EP), (Beatles), (UK), (US), (UK)'}]", "response": "Answer: Phil Spector\nEvidence: The multiple contexts mention the name \"Phil Spector\" and his involvement with the song in question.\nStep by step with evidence: 1.

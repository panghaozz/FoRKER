To avoid similar failures, it is crucial to differentiate between the release dates of songs and the pivotal moments of a band's prominence. The focus should be on identifying when the band truly became successful or famous, not just when a specific song was released.\nAnswer: early 1970s\nEvidence and explanation: The context in index 2 states that the rock band Slade rose to prominence during the early 1970s with multiple hits and number ones on the UK Singles Chart. This indicates that the band became successful in the early 1970s, not in 1984 when a specific song was released.\nStep by step with evidence and explanation: \n1. The claim is seeking information about when the rock band Slade rose to prominence.\n2. Context index 2 clearly states that Slade achieved prominence during the early 1970s with numerous chart-topping hits.\n3. By focusing on the information in the context that highlights the band's overall success and impact in the early 1970s, the correct answer should be the early 1970s.", "isRef": true, "EM pro correct": "True", "EM correct": "True"}

4. Therefore, based on the provided contexts, the answer to the claim is that the Isles led by Aonghus Mór were called the Kingdom of the Isles.

'idx': 2, 'title': 'Kingdom of the Isles', 'paragraph_text': 'The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. The islands were known to the Norse as the "Suðreyjar", or "Southern Isles" as distinct from the "Norðreyjar" or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland. The historical record is incomplete, and the kingdom was not a continuous entity throughout the entire period. The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, although only some of the later rulers claimed that title. At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney. At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory. The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south.'

At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown. Aonghus Mór's first certain appearance in the historical record seems to evince his involvement in aiding native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the north-west Ireland. Such cooperation could have been undertaken in the context of overseas kindreds like Clann Domhnaill constructing Irish alliances to gain assistance against Scottish encroachment."
'idx': 8, 'title': 'Lord of Islay', 'paragraph_text': 'Lord of Islay was a thirteenth- and fourteenth-century title borne by the chiefs of Clann Domhnaill before they assumed the title "Lord of the Isles" in the late fourteenth century. The first person regarded to have styled themself "Lord of Islay" is Aonghus Mór, son of the eponymous ancestor of the clan, Domhnall mac Raghnaill. The designation "of Islay" was frequently used by these lords and later members of the clan.'}]

The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.

The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.

Candidate answers: [Requiring only men to register for the draft, Male-only draft registration, Selective male conscription]
Answer: Requiring only men to register for the draft
Evidence and explanation: The Supreme Court decision in Rostker v. Goldberg upheld the constitutionality of requiring only men to register for the draft, as stated in the context provided.
Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The question asks which method of filling armed forces vacancies was deemed constitutional in Rostker v. Goldberg.
2. Context index 2 provides information on the Rostker v. Goldberg case, stating that the Supreme Court held the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft as constitutional.
3. Context index 4 discusses conscription in the United States but does not specifically address the Rostker v. Goldberg decision.
4. Context index 5 is about Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights and does not pertain to the Rostker v. Goldberg decision.
5. Therefore, the answer is that Rostker v. Goldberg held that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional. This answer is the most accurate, contains the most useful information, has no unnecessary narrative statements, and is highly relevant to the question.

'idx': 2, 'title': 'Rostker v. Goldberg', 'paragraph_text': 'Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional. After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only. Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional. (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.) In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed.'
'idx': 4, 'title': 'Conscription in the United States', 'paragraph_text': "Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars). The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act. It was the country's first peacetime draft. From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means. The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force. However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed."
'idx': 5, 'title': "Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights", 'paragraph_text': "In June 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC). It was the most important federal move in support of the rights of African-Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin. The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts. Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result. The war brought the race issue to the forefront. The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War. But by 1940, the African-American vote had largely shifted from Republican to Democrat, and African-American leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League had become recognized as part of the Roosevelt coalition. In June 1941, at the urging of A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces. In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order — the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942. In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces. Roosevelt agreed, but then did nothing to implement his promise. It was left to his successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces."}]

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The question asks for the time period during which the Western Germanic language was spoken, from which the settlement situated on the river Leda opposite Leer derives its name.
2. Context index 2 provides information about Old Saxon, stating that it was spoken from the 8th century until the 12th century.
3. Context index 5 mentions the settlement of Kloster Muhde, which derives its name from the Old Frisian "mutha," meaning "(river) mouth."

It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany, primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern Netherlands by Saxons, a Germanic tribe who inhabited the region of Saxony. It partially shares Anglo-Frisian's (Old Frisian, Old English) Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law which sets it apart from Low Franconian and Irminonic languages, such as Dutch, Luxembourgish and German."

Answer: Early 19th century
Evidence and explanation: The contexts provided indicate that Tecumseh became the primary leader of a large, multi-tribal confederacy in the early years of the nineteenth century. Specifically, context index 2 mentions that Tecumseh's Confederacy began to form around the teachings of Tenskwatawa in the early 19th century and that Tecumseh developed into the leader as early as 1808.
Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The question asks in which century Tecumseh became the primary leader of a large, multi-tribal confederacy.
2. Context index 2 titled "Tecumseh's Confederacy" states that the confederacy began to form in the early 19th century and Tecumseh became the leader as early as 1808.

Under Tecumseh's leadership, the confederation went to war with the United States during Tecumseh's War and the War of 1812. Following the death of Tecumseh in 1813 the confederation fell apart."

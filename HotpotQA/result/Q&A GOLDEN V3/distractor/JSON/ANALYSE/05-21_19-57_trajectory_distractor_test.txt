2. The "Russian Civil War" context clearly states that the war ended in 1923.
3. The "Socialist Revolutionary Party" context supports this by detailing the defeat and destruction of the anti-Bolshevik faction, which remained loyal to Alexander Kerensky, during the Russian Civil War.

The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.

Conscription
Answer: Requiring only men to register for the draft
Evidence and explanation: The Supreme Court case Rostker v. Goldberg ruled that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.
Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The claim asks for the method of filling armed forces vacancies upheld by the Rostker v. Goldberg decision.
2. Context index 2 provides information about the Rostker v. Goldberg case, stating that the Supreme Court held the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft as constitutional.

4. Based on the information provided, the answer is that the Rostker v. Goldberg case held that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.

'idx': 2, 'title': 'Rostker v. Goldberg', 'paragraph_text': 'Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional. After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only. Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional. (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.) In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed.'

The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act. It was the country's first peacetime draft. From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means. The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force. However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed."
'idx': 5, 'title': "Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights", 'paragraph_text': "In June 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC). It was the most important federal move in support of the rights of African-Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin. The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts. Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result. The war brought the race issue to the forefront. The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War. But by 1940, the African-American vote had largely shifted from Republican to Democrat, and African-American leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League had become recognized as part of the Roosevelt coalition. In June 1941, at the urging of A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces. In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order — the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942. In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces. Roosevelt agreed, but then did nothing to implement his promise. It was left to his successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces."}]

Argand lamp
Answer: Yes

Evidence and explanation: The Lewis lamp, used in many lighthouses, incorporated a design similar to the Argand lamp, which was patented by Aimé Argand in 1780. The Lewis lamp added a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens in front of it, similar to a variant created by Argand himself.

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The claim is about the similarity between the lamp used in many lighthouses and the Argand lamp.
2. Context index 0 provides information about the Argand lamp, stating it was patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand and had a brighter output than earlier lamps due to more complete combustion.
3. Context index 7 describes the Lewis lamp, which is used in lighthouses and mentions that it used a similar design to the Argand lamp, with the addition of a parabolic reflector and a magnifying lens.
4. The context indicates that while the Argand variant was widely used in European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp was selected for use in American lighthouses.

'idx': 7, 'title': 'Lewis lamp', 'paragraph_text': 'The Lewis lamp is a type of light fixture used in lighthouses. It was invented by Winslow Lewis who patented the design in 1810. The primary marketing point of the Lewis lamp was that it used less than half the oil of the prior oil lamps which they replaced. The lamp used a similar design to an Argand lamp, adding a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens made from 4 in green bottle glass in front of the lamp. A similar variant using a parabolic reflector was created by the inventor of the Argand lamp, Aimé Argand. While the Argand variant became widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was selected by the United States for use in American lighthouses.'

Answer: 8th to 12th century
Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that the Old Saxon language, which is closely related to the settlement's name, was spoken from the 8th century until the 12th century.

1. The claim asks for the time period during which the Western Germanic language associated with the settlement on the river Leda was spoken.
2. The context about "Old Saxon" states that it was a West Germanic language documented from the 8th century until the 12th century.
3. The context about "Leda (river)" mentions the settlement of Kloster Muhde, deriving its name from the Old Frisian word "mutha," indicating a connection to the West Germanic languages.
4. Since Old Saxon is a West Germanic language and was spoken during the specified period, it is reasonable to conclude that the language from which the settlement's name is derived was spoken between the 8th and 12th centuries.

'idx': 2, 'title': 'Old Saxon', 'paragraph_text': "Old Saxon, also known as Old Low German, was a Germanic language and the earliest recorded form of Low German (spoken nowadays in Northern Germany, the northeastern Netherlands, southern Denmark, the Americas and parts of Eastern Europe).

It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany, primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern Netherlands by Saxons, a Germanic tribe who inhabited the region of Saxony. It partially shares Anglo-Frisian's (Old Frisian, Old English) Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law which sets it apart from Low Franconian and Irminonic languages, such as Dutch, Luxembourgish and German."

The language of the earlier inhabitants of the region between the Zuiderzee and Ems River (the Frisians mentioned by Tacitus) is attested in only a few personal names and place-names. Old Frisian evolved into Middle Frisian, spoken from the 16th to the 19th century."

At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition.'}]", "processed context": "[{'idx': 5, 'title': 'Berea College', 'paragraph_text': '(Berea College), (Berea College), (Berea), (U.S.), (Kentucky), (Madison County), (Lexington), (1855), (Berea College), (the Southern United States), (Berea College), (four-year)'}, {'idx': 0, 'title': 'James Fieser', 'paragraph_text': '(Berea College), (James Fieser), (the University of Tennessee), (Martin), (B.A.), (Berea College), (M.A. and Ph.D.), (Purdue University), (the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)'}, {'idx': 6, 'title': 'Work college', 'paragraph_text': '(the United States), (four-year), (Federal Work Study)'}]", "answer": "berea college", "reflexion": " The previous reasoning correctly identified that Alain Resnais had a longer career than Scott Sidney based on the provided contexts.

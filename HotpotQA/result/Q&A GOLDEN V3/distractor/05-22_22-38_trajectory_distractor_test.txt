Right Answer:Nebo Zovyot
Candidate answers: [Mechte Navstrechu, Nebo Zovyot, I Was a Satellite of the Sun]
Answer: Nebo Zovyot
Evidence and explanation: The contexts provided indicate that both "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun" reused footage from the Soviet feature "Nebo Zovyot."
Step by step with evidence and explanation:

4. Context index 7 for "I Was a Satellite of the Sun" does not mention any connection to the films in question.
5. Since both "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun" are connected to "Nebo Zovyot," it is the correct answer to the claim.

Candidate answers: [Roman Empire, Roman Republic, Roman Britain]
Answer: Roman Empire
Evidence and explanation: The contexts provided indicate that the Celtic ruler Togodumnus ruled southeastern Britain prior to the Roman conquest, which began effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius of the Roman Empire.
Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The question asks which empire conquered southeastern Britain where the Celtic ruler Togodumnus ruled.
2. Context index 6 mentions the Roman conquest of Britain beginning in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, indicating the Roman Empire's involvement.
3. Context index 3 identifies Togodumnus as a king at the time of the Roman conquest, linking his rule to the period of the Roman Empire's expansion.

5. The term "Roman Republic" refers to an earlier period in Roman history, and "Roman Britain" is the name for the territory after conquest, making these options less correct.

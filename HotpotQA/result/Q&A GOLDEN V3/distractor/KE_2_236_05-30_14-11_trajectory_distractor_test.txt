Question:Are  Chrysalis and Look both women's magazines?
Right Answer:yes
Answer: No
Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that Chrysalis and Look are different types of publications. Chrysalis is described as a "Magazine of Women's Culture" published in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while Look is characterized as a "weekly" magazine published in the UK by Time Inc. This suggests that Chrysalis and Look are not both women's magazines.
Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The claim is asking whether Chrysalis and Look are both women's magazines.
2. The context for Chrysalis states that it was a "Magazine of Women's Culture" published from 1977 to 1980. This indicates that Chrysalis was a magazine focused on women's issues and culture.
3. In contrast, the context for Look describes it as a "weekly" magazine published in the UK by Time Inc. This suggests Look was a more general interest publication, not specifically a women's magazine.
4. Since the context indicates Chrysalis was a women's magazine but Look was a general weekly magazine, the evidence does not support the claim that they were both women's magazines. Therefore, the answer is no, Chrysalis and Look are not both women's magazines.

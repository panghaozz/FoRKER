Answer: 1923

Candidate answers: [English Electric Canberra, No British jet-powered bombers used, English Electric Canberra]
Answer: No British jet-powered bombers used
Evidence and explanation: The contexts provided mention the English Electric Canberra as a jet-powered aircraft operated by the No. 2 Squadron RAAF.

2. Context index 8 mentions the English Electric Canberra jets in relation to No. 2 Squadron RAAF, but this aircraft was used in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War, not World War II.
3. The other contexts provided do not mention any British jet-powered bombers used during World War II.
4. Since the English Electric Canberra was not in service during World War II and no other British jet-powered bombers are mentioned in the contexts, the correct answer is that there were no British jet-powered bombers used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. This answer is the most accurate and relevant to the question.

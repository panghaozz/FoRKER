Question:Are  Chrysalis and Look both women's magazines?
Right Answer:yes
Question: Are Chrysalis and Look both women's magazines?

Answer: No

Evidence and explanation:
The provided contexts indicate that Chrysalis is a feminist magazine focused on women's culture, while Look is a fashion and celebrity magazine for young women. 

Chrysalis is described as a "feminist publication" that integrated "politics, literature, cultural studies, and art" and featured contributions from prominent feminist thinkers and writers. In contrast, Look is characterized as a "high street fashion and celebrity weekly magazine for young women" that focuses on fashion, shopping, celebrity style, and real-life stories.

Given these distinct differences in content and focus, the evidence suggests that Chrysalis and Look are not both women's magazines, as Chrysalis has a more specialized feminist orientation while Look is a more general lifestyle/fashion magazine for young women.

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The question asks whether Chrysalis and Look are both women's magazines.
2. Context 3 provides information about Chrysalis, describing it as a "feminist publication" that covered a range of topics from a feminist perspective.
3. Context 5 describes Look as a "glossy high street fashion and celebrity weekly magazine for young women" focused on fashion, shopping, celebrities, and real-life stories.
4. Based on the differences in the content and focus of the two magazines, as described in the contexts, Chrysalis appears to be a more specialized feminist magazine, while Look is a more general women's lifestyle magazine.
5. Therefore, the evidence indicates that Chrysalis and Look are not both simply "women's magazines," as they have distinct purposes and areas of coverage.
6. The answer to the question is no, Chrysalis and Look are not both women's magazines.

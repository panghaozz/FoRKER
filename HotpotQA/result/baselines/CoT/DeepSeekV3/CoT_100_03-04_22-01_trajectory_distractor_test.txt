Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio.
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. Wolf Alice is a four-piece band with each member playing one or two instruments: Ellie Rowsell (vocals, guitar), Joff Oddie (guitars, vocals), Theo Ellis (bass), and Joel Amey (drums, vocals). This gives them a total of 4-5 instruments played by 4 people, resulting in an instrument to person ratio of approximately 1:1.
2. Badly Drawn Boy, on the other hand, is a solo artist (Damon Michael Gough) who is described as a multi-instrumentalist. This implies that he plays multiple instruments by himself, leading to a higher instrument to person ratio compared to Wolf Alice.
3. Therefore, Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio than Wolf Alice.

Question:Which British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II?
Right Answer:English Electric Canberra
Answer: English Electric Canberra
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The question asks for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II.
2. From the provided context, the English Electric Canberra (idx 5) is identified as a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber.
3. The context for the English Electric Canberra states that it was manufactured during the 1950s and introduced to the Royal Air Force in May 1951, making it a post-World War II aircraft.
4. However, the context for No. 2 Squadron RAAF (idx 8) mentions that the squadron saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and was later equipped with English Electric Canberra jets.
5. This indicates that while the English Electric Canberra itself was not used during World War II, its predecessor or related units were active in the South West Pacific theatre during the war.
6. Therefore, the English Electric Canberra is the correct answer as it is the British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber, even though it was introduced after World War II.

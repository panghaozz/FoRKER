Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio than Wolf Alice.

Evidence and explanation:
- Wolf Alice is a four-piece band with each member playing one or two instruments (vocals, guitar, bass, drums).
- Badly Drawn Boy is a solo artist (Damon Gough) who plays multiple instruments, as evidenced by the context stating he "wrote, produced, and played several instruments" on his album "The Hour of Bewilderbeast."

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation:
1. Wolf Alice consists of four members (Ellie Rowsell, Joff Oddie, Theo Ellis, Joel Amey) who collectively play a limited number of instruments (vocals, guitars, bass, drums).
2. Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act (Damon Gough) who plays multiple instruments, as mentioned in the context about his album "The Hour of Bewilderbeast."

Answer: The civil war ended in 1923.

Evidence and explanation: The Russian Civil War is described as lasting from November 1917 to October 1922, with minor skirmishes continuing into 1923. The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation:
1. The Russian Civil War began in November 1917, immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as stated in context 5.
2. The war involved multiple factions, including the Red Army (Bolsheviks) and the White Army, as well as other groups like the Green armies and foreign interventions.
3. The Red Army achieved significant victories over the White forces in 1919 and 1920, as mentioned in context 5.
4. The war officially ended in 1923, as Red control of the Soviet Union was assured by that time, although minor skirmishes continued into 1923 and armed resistance in Central Asia persisted until 1934.
5. Therefore, the civil war that ended with the defeat of Alexander Kerensky and his supporters by the Bolsheviks concluded in 1923.

Question:How many copies of Roald Dahl's variation on a popular anecdote sold?
Right Answer:250 million
Answer: The exact number of copies sold of Roald Dahl's variation on a popular anecdote, "Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat," is not provided in the given context.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided includes information about various collections and publications of Roald Dahl's works, but it does not specify the number of copies sold for any individual story, including "Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat."

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation:
1. The context mentions that "Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat" is a short story by Roald Dahl that first appeared in the 1959 issue of "Nugget" (Context 0).
2. The context also provides information about various collections and anthologies of Roald Dahl's works, such as "The Roald Dahl Treasury" (Context 2), "Roald Dahl: Collected Stories" (Context 3), "The Best of Roald Dahl" (Context 4), and "The Collected Short Stories of Roald Dahl" (Context 5).
3. While it is mentioned that Roald Dahl's books have sold more than 250 million copies worldwide (Context 6), this figure is for all of his works collectively and does not break down sales by individual stories or collections.
4. Therefore, without specific sales data for "Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat" or the collections in which it appears, it is not possible to determine the exact number of copies sold of this particular story.

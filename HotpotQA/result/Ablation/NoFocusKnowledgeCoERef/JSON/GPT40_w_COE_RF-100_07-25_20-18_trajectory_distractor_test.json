The error was due to not explicitly stating the timeframe in the answer, even though it was identified in the reasoning. To mitigate similar failures, the plan should include ensuring that the answer directly addresses the timeframe or specific detail requested in the claim, as well as verifying that the answer is explicitly stated in the contexts.\n\nAnswer: 1986 to 2013\n\nEvidence and explanation: Context index 9 clearly states that Alex Ferguson managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013. This timeframe encompasses the period during which David Beckham was recruited into the Manchester United first team, as indicated in context index 4.\n\nStep by step with evidence and explanation:\n1. The claim asks for the timeframe during which the football manager who recruited David Beckham managed Manchester United.\n2. Context index 4 mentions that Alex Ferguson drafted in young players like David Beckham during the 1995\u201396 season.\n3. Context index 9 provides the timeframe of Alex Ferguson's management of Manchester United, which is from 1986 to 2013.\n4. Since David Beckham was recruited into the first team during Ferguson's management, the timeframe when Ferguson managed Manchester United is the answer.\n5.

However, further context reveals that he was an Irish nationalist and was executed by the Irish Free State, indicating his strong ties to Ireland rather than England. To mitigate similar failures, it is crucial to consider the full context of a person's nationality and affiliations, especially when terms like \"British\" can refer to broader geographical or political associations rather than specific national origin.

To mitigate similar failures, it's important to focus on the specific events or outcomes related to the claim, rather than general timelines. A high-level plan would include cross-referencing specific events with the claim to ensure accurate identification of the answer.\n\nAnswer: January 1918\n\nEvidence and explanation: Context index 1 states that the anti-Bolshevik faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which remained loyal to Alexander Kerensky, was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution.

Directed, produced and edited by Katherine Foronjy and Joseph Coburn, the film follows a wide variety of fans over the course of the 2005 and 2006 baseball seasons, culminating in an exciting 7 game series against the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS. \"Mathematically Alive\" shows the emotional attachment that fans develop for their team and how it can be the source of great joy or tremendous sadness. In addition to the hundreds of fans interviewed for the film, Coburn and Foronjy also caught up with former Mets players Bud Harrelson, Ron Swoboda, Ed Charles, Tim Teuffel and legendary broadcaster Ralph Kiner. The filmmakers also interviewed Dr. Daniel Wann, a sports psychology professor at Murray State University, who explains many of the psychological characteristics sports fans share. Of particular focus in the film are a group of female Mets fans whose favorite player is former catcher Mike Piazza.

Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east. Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa\\'s second-most populous nation. Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity\\'s oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution. Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world. Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC. The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots). After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Judges/Princes\"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia\\'s modern history. Ethiopia\\'s borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization. It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini\\'s Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces.'}, {'idx': 3, 'title': 'Ethiopia\u2013Japan relations', 'paragraph_text': 'Ethiopia\u2013Japan relations are the international relations between Ethiopia and Japan.

It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate. Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria. Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected. In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war. Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor. Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.

Context index 2 further elaborates that the victory ensured Ethiopia's freedom from colonization.\n\nStep by step with evidence and explanation:\n1. The claim asks what the battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi lost his life secured for Ethiopia.\n2. Context index 0 mentions that Giuseppe Arimondi died in combat at Adwa.\n3. Context index 5 provides information about the Battle of Adwa, stating that it was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.\n4.

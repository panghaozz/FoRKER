Question:Were Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood of the same nationality?
golden idx: [1, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine the nationality of Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood, I will focus on contexts that provide biographical information about these individuals. 1. "Scott Derrickson" context: This context directly mentions Scott Derrickson and states that he is an American, which is relevant to the claim. 2. "Ed Wood" context: This context provides the full name and lifespan of Ed Wood, indicating that he was an American filmmaker, which is directly relevant to the claim. 3. "Ed Wood (film)" context: While this context is about a film named after Ed Wood, it does not directly state his nationality but is related to him. 4. "Deliver Us from Evil (2014 film)" context: This context mentions Scott Derrickson as the director of the film, which is somewhat relevant but does not discuss his nationality. 5. "Doctor Strange (2016 film)" context: Similar to the previous context, it mentions Scott Derrickson but does not address his nationality. 6. "Adam Collis" context: This context mentions Scott Derrickson in relation to Adam Collis, an American filmmaker, but does not provide information on Derrickson's nationality. 7. "Tyler Bates" context: This context mentions Scott Derrickson in the context of his work with Tyler Bates, but again, does not discuss nationality. 8. "Conrad Brooks" context: This context mentions Ed Wood in relation to Conrad Brooks, an American actor, but does not provide information on Wood's nationality. The remaining contexts are not directly relevant to the claim as they do not mention Scott Derrickson or Ed Wood.
idx: [1,8,2,6,7,3,9,5]

step-by-step think: The claim asks whether Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood were of the same nationality. To answer this, we need to identify the nationalities of both individuals.
1. "Scott Derrickson" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Scott Derrickson is an American, directly addressing half of the claim. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim regarding Derrickson's nationality.
2. "Ed Wood" context: This context is equally relevant because it states that Ed Wood was an American, providing the other half of the answer to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim regarding Wood's nationality.
The other contexts mention work related to these individuals but do not address their nationalities directly. Therefore, they are less relevant to the claim.

Context 6 mentions Shirley Temple Black, who played Corliss Archer, and details her roles as United States ambassador to Ghana and to Czechoslovakia, and as Chief of Protocol of the United States.

Question:Who was known by his stage name Aladin and helped organizations improve their performance as a consultant?
golden idx: [5, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the context that directly mentions "Aladin" and his role as a consultant, as this is the most relevant to the claim. Context 7 is the most relevant because it mentions Eenasul Fateh, also known by his stage name Aladin, and describes him as a former international management consultant. This directly answers the claim. Next, I will look for contexts that mention individuals with a stage name and a consulting background, even if the stage name is not Aladin, as these are still relevant to the claim. Contexts 0 and 1 mention individuals known by a stage name who are now consultants, making them the next most relevant. Context 3 mentions an individual with a stage name who became a marketer and consultant, so it is also relevant. Context 5 is about management consulting in general, which is relevant to the claim's mention of helping organizations improve their performance. The remaining contexts mention individuals with stage names but do not link them to a consulting role, making them less relevant to the claim. Therefore, I will rank them lower.
idx: [7, 0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Eenasul Fateh" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Eenasul Fateh, also known by his stage name Aladin, and describes him as a former international management consultant. It directly addresses the claim by providing information about his stage name and his role as a consultant. 2. "Management consulting" context: This context provides a general overview of what management consulting entails, which is related to the second part of the claim regarding helping organizations improve their performance. It is informative and could potentially contain more details relevant to the claim.

"For Against" context: Similarly, this context is highly relevant as it confirms that For Against is a band from the United States, addressing the other half of the claim. It provides information about the band's history and activity, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3.

golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, the informativeness of the context, and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim is looking for a screenwriter with credits for "Evolution" who also co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. 

1. Context idx 5 mentions David Weissman as a screenwriter for "Evolution" and includes another film title "The Family Man," which stars Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. This context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.

3. Context idx 3 mentions Téa Leoni in relation to the movie "Bad Boys," but it does not connect her to Nicolas Cage or the film "Evolution." It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
4. Context idx 0 mentions Nicolas Cage and a film he starred in, but it does not mention Téa Leoni or the film "Evolution." It is relevant in terms of mentioning Nicolas Cage but less likely to contain the answer.
5. Context idx 1 features Nicolas Cage but does not mention Téa Leoni or "Evolution." It is relevant due to the mention of Nicolas Cage but unlikely to contain the answer.
6. Context idx 2 also stars Nicolas Cage but does not mention Téa Leoni or "Evolution." It is relevant due to the mention of Nicolas Cage but unlikely to contain the answer.
7. Context idx 4 stars Nicolas Cage but does not mention Téa Leoni or "Evolution." It is relevant due to the mention of Nicolas Cage but unlikely to contain the answer.
8. Context idx 6 features Nicolas Cage but does not mention Téa Leoni or "Evolution." It is relevant due to the mention of Nicolas Cage but unlikely to contain the answer.

golden idx: [1, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer. 1.

Context idx 4: This context discusses the film "True Lies," another Schwarzenegger film, which might be confused with the one in the claim. 6. Context idx 3: This context mentions Guns N' Roses in relation to Hammerjack's Concert Hall and could be informative about the band's activities. 7. Context idx 6: This context provides a discography of Guns N' Roses, which could contain information about their promotions and soundtracks. 8.

The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not directly mention Guns N' Roses, Arnold Schwarzenegger, or the specific movie in question.
idx: [1, 8, 9, 2, 4, 3, 6, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the song by Guns N' Roses that was released on the soundtrack for the film "End of Days" in 1999, which aligns with the claim about the band performing a promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "End of Days (film)" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it provides details about the film "End of Days," including its release year (1999) and the fact that it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective, which is the exact information the claim is seeking. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography" context: While this context mentions Arnold Schwarzenegger and his involvement in films and music videos, including those for Guns N' Roses, it does not specifically address the claim regarding the promo for the movie. It is less relevant compared to the first two contexts. 4. "Last Action Hero" context: This context is about a different movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and does not mention Guns N' Roses or a promo related to the claim. It is informative but not relevant to the claim. 5.

It is the least relevant to the claim.

Question:Are Random House Tower and 888 7th Avenue both used for real estate?
golden idx: [1, 2]
step-by-step think: 1. "Random House Tower" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses one part of the claim, providing information about the Random House Tower and its use. 2. "888 7th Avenue" context: This context is also highly relevant as it directly addresses the other part of the claim, detailing the use of 888 7th Avenue. 3. "Pershing Square Capital Management" context: This context is relevant because it mentions 888 7th Avenue and its use, which is directly related to the claim. 4. "Real estate benchmarking" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses real estate benchmarking, which could be related to the use of buildings for real estate purposes. 5. "Real estate technology" context: This context is informative about real estate technology, which is related to the real estate industry but does not directly address the claim. 6. "Loan modification in the United States" context: This context discusses loan modifications in real estate, which is tangentially related to the claim but less likely to contain the specific answer. 7. "Villard (imprint)" context: This context is relevant to Random House but focuses on a publishing imprint rather than the use of the building. 8. "Hounsfield Heights/Briar Hill, Calgary" context: This context is the least relevant as it is about a neighborhood in Calgary and does not relate to the claim about buildings in New York.
idx: [2,1,4,6,0,9,5,8]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking whether both Random House Tower and 888 7th Avenue are used for real estate. To address this claim, I need to find contexts that mention the use of these buildings and whether they are related to real estate activities.
1. "Random House Tower" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that the Random House Tower is used as both the headquarters of Random House and a luxury apartment complex, indicating a mixed-use that includes real estate.
2. "888 7th Avenue" context: This context is also highly relevant because it describes 888 7th Avenue as an office skyscraper that houses corporate headquarters, which implies its use in real estate.
3. "Pershing Square Capital Management" context: This context is less relevant because it focuses on the hedge fund management company located at 888 7th Avenue, not on the building's use in real estate.
4. "Real estate technology" context: This context is informative about the real estate industry but does not specifically address the use of the two buildings in question.
5. "Real estate benchmarking" context: This context discusses the measurement and analysis of real estate properties but does not provide information about the specific use of Random House Tower and 888 7th Avenue.
6. "Villard (imprint)" context: This context is relevant to Random House but does not address the real estate aspect of the Random House Tower.
7. "Loan modification in the United States" context: This context is informative about real estate practices but does not relate to the specific buildings in question.
8. "Hounsfield Heights/Briar Hill, Calgary" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a neighborhood in Calgary, not the buildings in New York City.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the top two contexts are:

2. The context at index 9 mentions Alex Ferguson, who managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013. Although the timeframe does not match exactly, it provides information about another Manchester United manager, which may be helpful. 
3. The context at index 1 mentions Ernest Mangnall, who managed Manchester United between 1903 and 1912. Although this timeframe is not a perfect match, it provides relevant information about a Manchester United manager. 
4. The context at index 4 mentions the 1995-96 Manchester United season, during which young players like David Beckham were recruited. Although it does not mention the specific manager, it provides information about the period when David Beckham was recruited. 
5. The context at index 6 mentions the Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex, named after the manager who was born in 1909 and managed Manchester United. Although it does not provide a specific timeframe, it indirectly relates to the claim.

8. The context at index 0 mentions the 1996 FA Charity Shield, during which David Beckham scored a goal for Manchester United. Although it does not mention the specific manager, it indirectly relates to the claim. 
idx: [3, 9, 1, 4, 6, 7, 2, 0]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the timeframe during which the football manager who recruited David Beckham managed Manchester United. 1. "Alex Ferguson" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Alex Ferguson, who is known to have recruited David Beckham, and provides the exact years he managed Manchester United. It is informative and directly answers the claim. 2. "1995–96 Manchester United F.C. season" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the season when David Beckham was part of the team, and Alex Ferguson's role in recruiting young players like Beckham. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Matt Busby" context: While this context is about a manager of Manchester United, it does not directly relate to David Beckham's recruitment. 4. "The Class of '92" context: This context is about the rise of David Beckham and other players, but does not specify the manager's timeframe. 5. Other contexts: The remaining contexts are less relevant as they either discuss different time periods or different individuals not directly related to the claim.

Question:Brown State Fishing Lake is in a country that has a population of how many inhabitants ?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about the population of the country where Brown State Fishing Lake is located, we need to identify contexts that mention Brown State Fishing Lake and provide information about its location. Context 9 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Brown State Fishing Lake and its location in Brown County, Kansas, USA. Context 0 is the second most relevant because it provides the population of Brown County, Kansas, which is where the lake is located. Contexts 2, 3, and 8 are also relevant as they mention other fishing lakes in Kansas, indicating the country in question is the USA. Context 1 mentions a Fishing Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada, which is not relevant to Brown State Fishing Lake in Kansas. Contexts 4, 5, 6, and 7 mention lakes in locations other than Kansas, USA, and are therefore not relevant to the claim.
idx: [9, 0, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Brown County, Kansas" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides information about Brown County's population, which is where Brown State Fishing Lake is located. Since the claim asks for the population of the country, this context is indirectly relevant as it provides a local population figure. 2. "Brown State Fishing Lake" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it mentions Brown State Fishing Lake. However, it does not provide information about the population of the country but rather details about the lake itself. It is informative but less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the context that mentions population figures.

golden idx: [4, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for the former name of the conference in which the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team competes. The context that directly answers this is the one that mentions the historical names of the conference. 1. Context idx 4: This context is the most relevant as it provides information about the America East Conference, including its former name, the North Atlantic Conference, from 1988 to 1996. 2. Context idx 5: This context is relevant because it talks about the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team and mentions the conference they play in, but it does not mention the former name of the conference. 3.

Context idx 0: Similar to context idx 1, it discusses the basketball team's involvement in the America East Conference. 6. Context idx 2: This context also discusses the basketball team and the America East Conference but is less relevant than the others mentioned above. 7. Context idx 3: Again, this context is about the basketball team and the America East Conference, making it relevant but not as much as the top contexts. 8. Context idx 6: This context is about the basketball team's regular season championship in the America East Conference, which is relevant but does not provide historical information about the conference. The remaining contexts (idx 7 and 8) are less relevant because they do not mention the conference or the soccer team.
idx: [4, 5, 9, 1, 0, 2, 3, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "America East Conference" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the claim by mentioning the former names of the conference in which the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team competes. It provides specific information about the time period from 1988 to 1996, which is the focus of the claim. 2. "Vermont Catamounts men's soccer" context: This context is relevant because it pertains to the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team and mentions their participation in the America East Conference. However, it does not provide information about the former name of the conference, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first context.

"Armand Castelmary" context: This context mentions both Verdi and Thomas in relation to operas they composed, which is relevant but less direct than the individual contexts for each composer. 5. "Bernhard Bötel" context: This context mentions Ambroise Thomas's opera "Mignon," which is relevant but does not provide direct information about Thomas's status as an opera composer. 6. "Giuseppe Verdi (film)" context: This context is about a film portraying the life of Giuseppe Verdi and does not directly address his role as an opera composer. 7.

Context 7 provides information on Robert Hormats, who served in the government during the Nixon era, offering some relevance. 7. Context 1 discusses Edward D. Martin's role, which is similar to Egeberg's but in a different department and time, making it less relevant. 8. Context 2 is about Bradford P. Campbell, who served much later than Egeberg, thus being the least relevant. Contexts 3 and 8 are not included in the top 8 as they are less relevant than the others.

"Robert Erskine Childers" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Erskine Childers was a British writer, directly answering the claim. 2. "Robert Caesar Childers" context: This context is relevant because it mentions that Robert Caesar Childers was a British Orientalist scholar, indicating the British heritage of his son, Erskine Childers. 3. "Henry Roth" context: This context states that Henry Roth was an American novelist, which is directly relevant to the claim as it rules him out as being the English writer. 4.

While it may not directly mention the adventure in question, it is related to the game and could potentially contain the answer. 3. "Tunnels & Trolls" context: This context provides background information about the game itself, which is useful but does not directly answer the claim about a specific adventure within the game. 4. "Ken St. Andre" context: This context is about the creator of "Tunnels & Trolls" but does not mention specific adventures, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 5. "Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes" context: While this context mentions that its mechanics are based on those of "Tunnels and Trolls", it does not provide information about a specific adventure in the game, making it less relevant. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the game "Tunnels & Trolls" or its adventures and therefore are unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:When was Poison's album "Shut Up, Make Love" released?
golden idx: [2, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the release date of Poison's album "Shut Up, Make Love". Context 2 directly mentions the song "Shut Up, Make Love" and provides the release date of the album "Crack a Smile...and More!" which includes the song, making it the most relevant and informative. Context 0 also mentions the song as a b-side to the single "Be the One" from the same album, making it the second most relevant. Context 5 provides general information about the band Poison, which could be useful for background but does not directly answer the claim. The rest of the contexts mention songs or albums with similar titles or themes related to 'making love' but are not directly related to the band Poison or the album in question, thus they are ranked lower in relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.
idx: [2, 0, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]

step-by-step think:1. Context with 'idx': 2 is the most relevant as it directly mentions the song "Shut Up, Make Love" and provides information about its release within the "Crack a Smile...and More!" album in 2000, which is directly related to the claim. 2. Context with 'idx': 0 is the second most relevant because it also discusses the "Crack a Smile...and More!" album and mentions "Shut Up, Make Love" as the first single from the album, providing additional context about the album's release. 3. The other contexts, while they contain similar phrases or are related to music, do not directly address the claim about Poison's album or the song "Shut Up, Make Love" and are therefore not as relevant.

Question:Hayden is a singer-songwriter from Canada, but where does Buck-Tick hail from?
golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to find the context that mentions where Buck-Tick hails from. Context 8 directly answers the question, stating that Buck-Tick is a Japanese rock band formed in Fujioka, Gunma. Context 7 provides information about Atsushi Sakurai, the vocalist of Buck-Tick, which is highly relevant. Context 3 mentions Masami Tsuchiya's work with Buck-Tick, adding to the relevance. Context 6 is about Hayden, the Canadian singer-songwriter, and is relevant to the first part of the claim. Context 1 also mentions Hayden but is less informative about his background. Context 4 talks about Hayden's album and its release in Japan, which is tangentially related to the claim. Context 2 and Context 0 are not relevant to the claim. Context 5 is the least relevant as it only provides a brief mention of Hayden without any substantial information related to the claim.
idx: [8, 7, 3, 6, 1, 4, 2, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "Buck-Tick" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the second part of the claim regarding Buck-Tick's origin, providing detailed information about the band's formation in Fujioka, Gunma, Japan. It is informative and contains the answer to where Buck-Tick hails from. 2. "Atsushi Sakurai" context: This context is also relevant because it provides additional information about Atsushi Sakurai, the lead vocalist of Buck-Tick, and mentions his birthplace in Fujioka, Gunma, which supports the information given in the "Buck-Tick" context. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim as it corroborates the location of Buck-Tick's origin. 3. "Masami Tsuchiya" context: While this context mentions Buck-Tick, it is more focused on Masami Tsuchiya and does not directly answer the claim about Buck-Tick's origin. 4. "Kyo (musician)" context: This context mentions Buck-Tick as an inspiration for Kyo but does not provide information about Buck-Tick's origin. 5. "Mild and Hazy" context: This context is relevant to the first part of the claim, mentioning Hayden as a Canadian singer-songwriter. However, it does not provide information about Buck-Tick. 6. "Skyscraper National Park" context: Similar to "Mild and Hazy," this context is relevant to Hayden but does not address Buck-Tick's origin. 7. "Dewey Beard" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses Dewey Beard and does not mention Buck-Tick or Hayden. 8. "Alberta Hail Project" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it focuses on a research project in Alberta, Canada, and does not mention Buck-Tick or Hayden.

Question:Which  French ace pilot and adventurer fly L'Oiseau Blanc
golden idx: [5, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about the French ace pilot and adventurer who flew L'Oiseau Blanc. 1. Context 5 directly mentions L'Oiseau Blanc and the pilots Charles Nungesser and François Coli, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 2. Context 2 mentions the aircraft L'Oiseau Blanc and the pilots, adding to its relevance. 3. Context 6 is about Charles Nungesser, one of the pilots of L'Oiseau Blanc, thus very relevant. 4. Context 8 is about François Coli, the navigator of L'Oiseau Blanc, also highly relevant. 5. Context 0 mentions the competitors for the Orteig Prize, including Nungesser and Coli, making it somewhat relevant. 6. Context 7, while mentioning a painting named L'Oiseau bleu, is not about the aircraft or the pilots, making it less relevant. 7. Context 1, 3, and 4 are about other French aces and do not mention L'Oiseau Blanc or the pilots in question, so they are less relevant. 8. Context 9 is about an English pilot and writer, which is not relevant to the claim.
idx: [5,2,6,8,0,7,1,3]

step-by-step think:1. "L'Oiseau Blanc" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the aircraft "L'Oiseau Blanc" and provides detailed information about its pilots, Charles Nungesser and François Coli, and their attempt to fly from Paris to New York. It is very informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Charles Nungesser" context: This context is also highly relevant because it focuses on Charles Nungesser, one of the pilots of "L'Oiseau Blanc." It provides information about his background and achievements, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "François Coli" context: Similar to the "Charles Nungesser" context, this one is about François Coli, the other pilot of "L'Oiseau Blanc." It is relevant and informative but slightly less so than the context specifically about the aircraft. 4. "Levasseur PL.8" context: This context is relevant as it describes the aircraft model "Levasseur PL.8," which "L'Oiseau Blanc" was. It provides technical details about the plane and its significance to the pilots' attempt. 5. "Wooster and Davis" context: While this context mentions the Orteig Prize and competitors, it is less directly related to the claim about "L'Oiseau Blanc" and its pilots. It is informative but not as relevant as the other contexts. 6. "L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)" context: This context is about a painting and an artist, not directly related to the claim about the aircraft or its pilots. It is the least relevant and unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 7. "Paul Sauvage (aviator)" context: This context is about a different French ace pilot and is not directly related to the claim. It is informative about Paul Sauvage but not about "L'Oiseau Blanc" or its pilots. 8. "Georges Madon" context: This context is about another French ace pilot and, like the "Paul Sauvage" context, does not directly relate to the claim about "L'Oiseau Blanc" or its pilots.

Context 0 ("My Bride is a Mermaid"): While this context is about a different manga, it includes the name "Seto" in the title, which might lead to confusion, but it's not about the manga series in question. 4. Context 1 ("Silver Spoon (manga)"): This context is about a different manga and author, so it's less relevant. 5. Context 2 ("The Kindaichi Case Files"): This context is about a different manga series and does not provide information about the author's birth year. 6.

"P'ent'ay" context: This context is the least relevant to the claim as it does not mention the Battle of Adwa or its consequences for Ethiopia.
idx: [5,0,7,8,2,3,9,1]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi died and what it secured for Ethiopia. 1. "Battle of Adwa" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the Battle of Adwa, where Giuseppe Arimondi died, and states that the battle secured Ethiopian sovereignty. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Giuseppe Arimondi" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides information about Giuseppe Arimondi, including his death at the Battle of Adwa, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not explicitly state what the battle secured for Ethiopia, making it slightly less relevant than the "Battle of Adwa" context. 3. "First Italo-Ethiopian War" context: This context is relevant as it provides background on the war in which the Battle of Adwa was a part, but it is less directly related to the claim than the first two contexts. 4.

The claim involves Alfred Balk serving as the secretary of a committee on employment of minority groups in the news media under a specific U.S. Vice President.

1. Context 4 is directly relevant as it mentions Alfred Balk and his role as secretary of the Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media under New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who also served as Vice President. This context is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 3 mentions Nelson Rockefeller, who is directly connected to Alfred Balk according to context 4. This context is relevant and may contain additional information that supports the answer.

4. Context 1 discusses Cynthia Hogan's role as Counsel to Vice President Joe Biden. This context is relevant to the extent that it involves a Vice President, but it does not mention Alfred Balk or the specific committee in question.
5. Context 0, while mentioning a Vice President's role, does not relate to the claim about Alfred Balk or the committee he served on.
6. Contexts 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are not relevant as they do not mention Vice Presidents in the context of Alfred Balk or the committee on employment of minority groups in the news media.

Question:Who is the writer of this song that was inspired by words on a tombstone and was the first track on the box set Back to Mono?
golden idx: [5, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the ones that mention "Back to Mono" and "To Know Him Is to Love Him," as these are directly related to the claim. Context 5 titled 'Back to Mono (1958–1969)' is the most relevant because it not only mentions the box set but also the first track, which is the subject of the claim. Context 7 titled 'To Know Him Is to Love Him' is the second most relevant, as it provides information about the song and its writer, Phil Spector, which is the answer to the claim. The next most relevant contexts are those related to music and box sets, as they may contain information about the song or the artist. Contexts 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mention various box sets and could potentially contain information about the song or similar songs. Context 6, while about a box set, is less likely to contain the answer because it is about a different band and genre. Contexts 8 and 9 are the least relevant, as they do not mention the box set or the song and are about different genres or artists.

step-by-step think: 1. Back to Mono (1958–1969) context: This context directly mentions the song "To Know Him Is to Love Him," which is part of the claim. It provides information about the box set and the first track on it. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.

Question:Are Ferocactus and Silene both types of plant?
golden idx: [1, 4]
step-by-step think: 1. "Ferocactus" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses one of the plants mentioned in the claim, providing information about the genus Ferocactus and its characteristics. 2. "Silene" context: This context is also highly relevant as it provides information about the genus Silene, which is the second plant mentioned in the claim. It gives an overview of the genus and its distribution. 3. "Silene menziesii" context: This context is relevant because it discusses a specific species within the Silene genus, providing detailed information about its characteristics and habitat. 4. "Silene conoidea" context: Similar to the previous context, this one provides detailed information about another species of Silene, making it relevant to the claim. 5. "Silene tomentosa" context: This context is about a rare species of Silene, adding to the relevance regarding the Silene genus mentioned in the claim. 6. "Silene antirrhina" context: This context discusses a species of Silene native to the Americas, contributing to the overall information about the Silene genus. 7. "Silene suksdorfii" context: This context provides information about a species of Silene found in the Pacific Northwest, relevant to the claim about Silene being a type of plant. 8. "Silene latifolia" context: This context is about a species of Silene that is widespread in Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa, adding to the claim's relevance.
idx: [4,1,0,2,3,5,6,8]

step-by-step think: The claim asks whether Ferocactus and Silene are both types of plants. To address this claim, the contexts must provide information that confirms both are plant genera.
1. "Ferocactus" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly confirms that Ferocactus is a genus of cacti, which are plants. It is informative and directly answers half of the claim.
2. "Silene" context: This context is equally relevant because it confirms that Silene is a genus of flowering plants. It provides a broad overview of the genus, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. "Silene menziesii" context: While this context is about a specific species within the Silene genus, it is less relevant than the general Silene context because it focuses on one species rather than the genus as a whole.
4. "Silene conoidea" context: Similar to the "Silene menziesii" context, this one is about a specific species and is informative but less relevant to the claim than the general Silene context.
5. "Silene tomentosa" context: This context is about a rare species of Silene and is specific, making it less relevant to the claim compared to the general information about the Silene genus.
6. "Silene antirrhina" context: Again, this is about a specific species within the Silene genus and is less relevant to the claim than the general Silene context.
7. "Silene suksdorfii" context: This context is about another specific species of Silene and, while informative, is less relevant to the claim.
8. "Silene latifolia" context: This context provides information about a species of Silene and its native range, but it is less relevant to the claim than the general Silene context.

golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. Context 5, "English Electric Canberra," directly answers the claim as it mentions the aircraft being a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. Context 3, "No. 12 Squadron RAAF," is highly relevant as it operated in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II and mentions bomber operations. Context 8, "No. 2 Squadron RAAF," also mentions operating bombers in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. Context 1, "South West Pacific Area (command)," provides extensive information about the South West Pacific theatre, which is the location mentioned in the claim. Context 6, "South West Pacific theatre of World War II," is relevant as it describes the theatre of operations where the bomber was used. Context 7, "Asiatic-Pacific Theater," is less directly relevant but still informative about the broader area of operations. Context 0, "Savoia-Marchetti SM.79," is not relevant as it is an Italian aircraft. Context 2, "Edwin A. Doss," is informative about a pilot in the South West Pacific theatre but does not mention bombers. Context 4, "Coastwatchers," and Context 9, "Tupolev Tu-12," are not relevant to the claim.
idx: [5,3,8,1,6,7,2,0]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. 1. "English Electric Canberra" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber, which directly aligns with the claim. However, it states that the Canberra was introduced in 1951, which is after World War II, making it unlikely to be the answer to the claim. 2. "No. 12 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is relevant as it discusses a squadron that operated in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. It mentions the squadron's activities and equipment changes, which could potentially include the bomber in question. 3. "No. 2 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is also relevant as it mentions the squadron's operations in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II and its use of English Electric Canberra jets, but these were used post-World War II, similar to the first context. 4. "South West Pacific Area (command)" and "South West Pacific theatre of World War II" contexts: Both provide background on the theatre of operations but do not mention specific aircraft used. 5. "Asiatic-Pacific Theater" context: This context provides information on the broader Pacific theatre and command structure but lacks details on specific bombers. 6. "Edwin A. Doss" context: This context focuses on an American fighter pilot's service in the South West Pacific Theatre but does not mention British bombers. 7. "Savoia-Marchetti SM.79" context: This context is about an Italian medium bomber, not British, and thus is not relevant to the claim.

Question:Which year and which conference was the 14th season for this conference as part of the NCAA Division that the Colorado Buffaloes played in with a record of 2-6 in conference play?
golden idx: [1, 7]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to find the context that mentions the 14th season of a conference as part of the NCAA Division where the Colorado Buffaloes played with a record of 2-6 in conference play. The most relevant context will be the one that mentions the specific season and the conference's name, along with the Buffaloes' record.
1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 14th season for the Big 12 Conference, which is directly related to the claim.
2. Context idx 7: This context is relevant because it mentions the Colorado Buffaloes' record of 2-6 in Big 12 play, which aligns with the claim.
3. Context idx 0: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions the Colorado Buffaloes and their record, but it does not specify the 14th season of the conference.
4. Context idx 5: This context is relevant as it mentions the Colorado Buffaloes' record in Pac-12 play, but it does not specify the 14th season.
5. Context idx 8: This context is relevant as it mentions the Colorado Buffaloes' record in Pac-12 play, but it does not specify the 14th season.
6. Context idx 9: This context is relevant as it mentions the Colorado Buffaloes in the Pac-12 Conference, but it does not specify the 14th season or the record.
7. Context idx 4: This context is less relevant as it mentions an earlier season of the Colorado Buffaloes and does not provide information about the 14th season or the record in conference play.
8. Context idx 2 and 3: These contexts are about the men's basketball team and are not relevant to the claim about football conference play.
9. Context idx 6: This context is about the men's basketball team and is not relevant to the claim about football conference play.
idx: [1, 7, 0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 2]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the specific year and conference of the 14th season of NCAA Division that the Colorado Buffaloes played in with a 2-6 conference record. 1. "2009 Big 12 Conference football season" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 14th season for the Big 12, aligning with the claim's request for the 14th season of a conference. It is likely to contain the answer since it directly relates to the Big 12 Conference's 2009 season. 2. "2009 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses the 2009 Colorado Buffaloes football team, their record, and their participation in the Big 12 play, which is likely the answer to the claim. 3. "2014 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is less relevant because it refers to the 2014 season, which is not the 14th season of the conference. 4. "2015 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is also less relevant for the same reason as the 2014 context. 5. "2011 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it refers to the Pac-12 Conference, not the 14th season of the conference in question. 6. "2012 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it refers to a different year and does not mention the 14th season. 7. "1989 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it refers to a much earlier season. 8. "2015–16 Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball team" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about basketball, not football.

4. "Pilgerodendron" context: This context mentions the genus "Pilgerodendron" and provides information about its classification, species, and distribution. Although it is not directly related to the Cypress genus, it is still relevant as it belongs to the same family (Cupressaceae). It may contain some useful information that can be compared or contrasted with the Cypress genus.

5. "Ajugeae" context: This context is about the tribe "Ajugeae" within the Lamiaceae family, which includes the genus "Ajuga".

step-by-step think: 1. "Ajuga" context: This context directly addresses half of the claim by confirming that Ajuga is indeed a genus, providing information about its classification and characteristics. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim regarding Ajuga. 2. "Cypress" context: This context provides information about the Cypress, which is relevant to the other half of the claim.

It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim regarding Cypress. 3. "Cupressus" context: While this context provides detailed information about the Cupressus genus within the Cupressaceae family, it is less directly relevant to the claim than the "Cypress" context because it does not confirm whether "Cypress" itself is a genus. 4. "Ajugeae" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the tribe Ajugeae, which includes the genus Ajuga. However, it is less directly related to the claim than the "Ajuga" context. 5.

The claim is looking for the singer whose song was released as the lead single from the album "Confessions" and was stuck behind a popular song for eight consecutive weeks.

1. Context 0 ("Yeah! (Usher song)"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Usher's song "Yeah!" being released as the lead single from the album "Confessions." It also provides detailed information about the song and its production, making it very likely to contain the answer to the claim.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer, the top 8 ranked contexts are:

Context 7 titled 'Tromeo and Juliet' directly mentions a 1996 film which is a loose adaptation of "Romeo & Juliet" and is written by James Gunn, making it the most relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 1 titled 'James Gunn' is also highly relevant as it mentions James Gunn's career as a screenwriter and includes "Tromeo and Juliet" among his works. Context 0 titled 'Romeo + Juliet' is relevant to the claim as it mentions a 1996 adaptation of "Romeo and Juliet", but it does not mention James Gunn, so it is less likely to contain the answer than Context 7 or 1. Context 6 titled 'Romeo and Juliet on screen' provides information about various adaptations of "Romeo and Juliet", including the 1996 version, which could be useful for comparison. Context 4 titled 'A rose by any other name would smell as sweet' is less directly related to the claim but still relevant as it discusses the play "Romeo and Juliet". Context 9 titled 'Romeo' is about the character from the play and is informative but less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

step-by-step think:1. "Tromeo and Juliet" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Tromeo and Juliet" as a 1996 film and a loose adaptation of Shakespeare's "Romeo & Juliet", which is the exact answer to the claim. It also specifies that James Gunn wrote the screenplay, directly linking to the claim. 2. "James Gunn" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions James Gunn's role in writing the script for "Tromeo and Juliet" (1996), providing background information on his career and confirming his involvement with the film.

golden idx: [2, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about an American professional Hawaiian surfer born on 18 October 1992 who won the Rip Curl Pro Portugal. The context must mention the surfer's name and the event to score highly. 1. Context 5 is the most relevant as it mentions John John Florence, who fits the description of the claim and is noted as a winner of the World Surf League Men's Championship. 2. Context 2 is relevant as it mentions the Rip Curl Pro Portugal event and the defending champion, John John Florence, who won in 2016. 3. Context 8 is relevant as it describes the Supertubos beach where the Rip Curl Pro Portugal is held annually. 4. Context 0 provides information about the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal 2017 event, which is part of the World Surf League Men's Championship Tour. 5. Context 3 talks about the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal 2016 event, which is relevant to the surfing competition in question. 6. Context 6 discusses the Moche Rip Curl Pro Portugal 2015 event, which is part of the same tour. 7. Context 4 mentions the Moche Rip Curl Pro Portugal 2014 event, which is less recent but still relevant. 8. Context 1 talks about Barton Lynch, an Australian surfer who won the Rip Curl Pro in 1991, which is informative but less directly related to the claim. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim or do not mention the surfer in question.

Question:What is the middle name of the actress who plays Bobbi Bacha in Suburban Madness?
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: To determine the middle name of the actress who plays Bobbi Bacha in "Suburban Madness," the most relevant context would be one that mentions the actress by name and provides information about her, including her middle name. 1. "Sela Ward" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Sela Ward, the actress who played Bobbi Bacha, and includes her full name, revealing her middle name as "Ann." 2. "Bobbi Bacha" context: This context is relevant because it confirms that Sela Ward played the character Bobbi Bacha, linking the actress to the role mentioned in the claim. 3. "Suburban Madness" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the film "Suburban Madness" and mentions Sela Ward's role, which is directly related to the claim. 4. "Middle name" context: While this context discusses the concept of middle names, it does not provide information about Sela Ward's middle name, making it less relevant than the contexts that mention her directly. 5. "Chris Funk" context: This context is informative about middle names due to a clerical error but is not relevant to the claim about the actress Sela Ward. 6. "Marion Christopher Barry" context: This context discusses middle names and provides an example, but it is not relevant to the claim. 7. "Jeff Strabone" context: This context includes a discussion about changing a middle name for political reasons, which is not relevant to the claim. 8. "Latvian name" context: This context discusses the practice of middle names in Latvian culture, which is not relevant to the claim about an American actress. The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not pertain to the actress or the concept of middle names in a way that would likely answer the claim.
idx: [0, 2, 3, 4, 1, 8, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the following factors:
1. Relevance: I will look for contexts that directly mention the actress who plays Bobbi Bacha in "Suburban Madness".
2. Informativeness: I will prefer contexts that provide more detailed information about the actress and her role in the movie.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: I will prioritize contexts that specifically mention the middle name of the actress.

Based on these factors, I will rank the contexts as follows:

1. Context 2: Bobbi Bacha
   - This context directly mentions Bobbi Bacha, a Texas Private Investigator portrayed in the movie "Suburban Madness" by actress Sela Ward. It provides specific information about the character and her involvement in a real-life murder case. This context is highly relevant, informative, and likely to contain the answer to the claim.

2. Context 3: Suburban Madness
   - This context provides information about the movie "Suburban Madness" and mentions Sela Ward as PI Bobbi Bacha. It also mentions that the movie is based on a true story. While it does not specifically mention the middle name of the actress, it is still relevant and likely to contain additional information about the actress and her character in the movie.

Therefore, the top 2 ranked contexts are:

idx: [2, 3]

Question:In which year was the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours born?
golden idx: [4, 7]
step-by-step think: To answer the question about the birth year of the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours, we need to identify the context that directly mentions the King associated with the 1925 Birthday Honours. Context 7 titled 'George V' provides the exact information needed, stating that George V was born on 3 June 1865. This context is the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. The other contexts mention various Birthday Honours but do not provide information about the birth year of the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours. Therefore, they are ranked lower in relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.
idx: [7,4,0,1,2,3,5,6]

step-by-step think:1. "George V" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions George V and provides specific information about his birth year, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "1925 Birthday Honours" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the 1925 Birthday Honours and the King who made them, which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim since it is about the event in question. 3. "Birthday Honours" context: While this context provides general information about the Birthday Honours, it does not specify the King or the year of birth, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts that do. 4. "1951 Birthday Honours" context: This context is about the Birthday Honours made by King George VI, not the King in question (George V), and therefore is less relevant. 5. "2014 Birthday Honours", "2015 Birthday Honours", "2017 Birthday Honours", and "1965 Birthday Honours" contexts: These contexts are about Birthday Honours in years unrelated to the claim and do not mention George V or his year of birth, making them the least relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [4, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim mentions a book titled "Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine", so we can assume that relevant contexts would mention the book or the women mentioned in the book. We can also assume that a context that directly mentions a former white house intern would be more likely to contain the answer. 

1. Context with idx 7: This context directly mentions the book "Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine", which is part of the claim. It provides information about the book and the women mentioned in it. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.

2. Context with idx 1: This context mentions a book by a former White House intern titled "Once Upon a Secret". Although it is not directly related to the claim, it provides information about a book by a former white house intern, which is likely to contain information about other former white house interns. It is relevant and likely contains useful information.

3. Context with idx 4: This context directly mentions Monica Lewinsky, who is mentioned in the claim as a former white house intern. It provides brief information about Monica Lewinsky. It is directly relevant and likely contains information about Monica Lewinsky's involvement with the Clinton machine.

4. Context with idx 2: This context mentions a former White House Counsel under President Bill Clinton, which is indirectly related to the claim. It provides information about the person mentioned. It is less directly relevant and less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous contexts.

5. Context with idx 0: This context mentions a book authored by Connie Mariano, which is indirectly related to the claim. It provides information about the book and the content it covers. It is less directly relevant and less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous contexts.

6. Context with idx 3: This context mentions Mark D. Fabiani, who is a former White House lawyer and spokesman, but it does not directly relate to the claim. It provides information about Mark D. Fabiani's work. It is less directly relevant and less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous contexts.

7. Context with idx 5: This context mentions William H. Ginsburg, who was a lawyer representing Monica Lewinsky.

It is less directly relevant and less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous contexts.

8. Context with idx 9: This context mentions the Lewinsky scandal, which indirectly relates to the claim. It provides information about the scandal involving Monica Lewinsky and President Bill Clinton. It is less directly relevant and less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous contexts.

idx: [7,1,4,2,0,3,5,9]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the name of a woman who is both mentioned in the book "Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine" and was a former White House intern. 1. "Their Lives" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to the book mentioned in the claim and lists the names of women who are the subject of the book, including Monica Lewinsky, who is known to have been a White House intern. 2. "Monica Lewinsky" context: This context is also highly relevant because it specifically mentions Monica Lewinsky and identifies her as a former White House intern, directly answering the claim. 3. "Lewinsky scandal" context: While this context is informative about the scandal involving Monica Lewinsky and President Bill Clinton, it does not directly answer the claim about the book. 4. "William H. Ginsburg" context: This context mentions Monica Lewinsky and her lawyer, which is relevant but less direct in answering the claim compared to the contexts that mention the book and her role as an intern. 5.

It provides detailed information about his life and work, which makes it likely to contain the answer to the claim. However, it is ranked second as the claim specifically asks about a singer David Huntsinger has worked with, and while Crouch's context is informative, it does not explicitly mention a collaboration with Huntsinger. 3. "David Huntsinger" context: Although this context is about David Huntsinger and lists many artists he has worked with, it does not specify the birth months of these artists, making it less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim. 4. "Latice Crawford" context: This context mentions Latice Crawford, a gospel singer born in July, but is ranked lower because the claim is about a singer that David Huntsinger has worked with, and there is no mention of a collaboration between them. 5. "Kierra Sheard" context: This context is about Kierra Sheard, who is not born in July, making it irrelevant to the claim. 6. "Just as I Am (Yolanda Adams album)" context: This context is about Yolanda Adams' album and does not provide information about her birth month or a collaboration with David Huntsinger, making it less relevant. 7. "J-Shin" context: This context is about J-Shin, who is not a gospel singer born in July, making it irrelevant to the claim. 8. "Muyiwa Olarewaju" context: This context is about Muyiwa Olarewaju, who is not born in July, making it irrelevant to the claim.

The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not directly address the leadership of Fine Gael since 2017 or the roles of Taoiseach and Minister for Defence.

The context that directly answers this is the one that mentions Hill Air Force Base and the history behind its name. 1.

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the specific airplane Major Ployer Peter Hill was test-flying after whom the base, where the 514th Flight Test Squadron is stationed, is named. To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer:
1. Context with 'idx': 4, 'title': 'Hill Air Force Base' is highly relevant as it mentions Major Ployer Peter Hill and the specific airplane he was test-flying, the B-17 Flying Fortress bomber, which directly answers the claim.
2. Context with 'idx': 0, 'title': '514th Flight Test Squadron' is relevant because it is directly associated with Hill Air Force Base where the 514th Flight Test Squadron is stationed, but it does not mention the airplane or the Major.
The other contexts are about different flight test squadrons and bases, which are not directly relevant to the claim about Major Hill and the airplane he was test-flying.

Question:Over how many centuries were the "dwelling place of the dead" built?
golden idx: [0, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the "dwelling place of the dead" and the time span over which they were built. 1. Context idx 5: It directly relates to the claim as it discusses the Montezuma Castle National Monument, which is a set of well-preserved dwellings known as the "dwelling place of the dead" built by the Sinagua people over three centuries. 2. Context idx 0: It is relevant as it mentions the Yavapai Indians' refusal to enter the cliff-dwellings at Montezuma Castle because they were considered the "dwelling place of the dead." 3. Context idx 4: It mentions Château de Druyes, a medieval castle used as a dwelling place over several centuries, which could be relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 9: The Tabernacle is described as a portable dwelling place of God, and while it is not a "dwelling place of the dead," it was in use over a period that could be relevant to the claim. 5. Context idx 3: It discusses synagogues, some of which have been in continuous use for many centuries, but it does not directly relate to the "dwelling place of the dead." 6. Context idx 6: Similar to idx 3, it talks about old synagogues in the UK, which may have relevance due to the time span but not directly to the "dwelling place of the dead." 7. Context idx 1 and idx 7: Both mention Norse mythology realms that serve as dwelling places for the souls of the dead, which is relevant to the claim. 8. Context idx 8: It discusses "Shamayim," the dwelling place of God and other heavenly beings, which is less relevant to the claim about the "dwelling place of the dead." 9. Context idx 2: It is the least relevant as it discusses inquilines, animals living in the dwelling places of other species, which does not relate to the claim.
idx: [5, 0, 4, 9, 3, 6, 1, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Montezuma Castle National Monument" context: It directly relates to the claim as it mentions the "dwelling place of the dead" being built by the Sinagua people. It provides specific information about the structure and the time it took to build it, which is relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. "Tabernacle" context: Although it does not directly mention the "dwelling place of the dead" being built over centuries, it provides information about a different "dwelling place" mentioned in the Bible. However, it might not be as relevant or likely to contain the answer compared to the context directly related to the claim. 
3. "Flaming Feather" context: This context mentions the "dwelling place of the dead" in relation to the Montezuma Castle National Monument. However, it does not provide as much specific information about the structure or the time it took to build it compared to the first context. It is still relevant and likely to contain some information about the claim. 
4. "Château de Druyes" context: This context discusses a medieval castle in France and does not directly relate to the claim about the "dwelling place of the dead" being built over centuries by the Sinagua people. It is informative but less likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts that directly mention the claim. 
5. "List of oldest synagogues" context: This context discusses synagogues and does not directly relate to the claim about the "dwelling place of the dead" being built over centuries. It is informative but less likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts that directly mention the claim.

golden idx: [2, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the birth date of the British author who wrote the novel "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush." Context 6 mentions Hunter Davies, who is the author of the novel, and provides his birth date, making it the most relevant and informative. Context 2 is about the film based on the novel and mentions Hunter Davies, so it is also relevant. Context 0 mentions an actor in the film adaptation of the novel, which is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. Context 3 mentions another actor in the film, which is similar in relevance to context 0. Context 4 is about a song related to the film, which is less relevant to the claim. Context 9 mentions the director of the film, which is informative but not directly related to the author's birth date. Context 1 is about the nursery rhyme, which is not relevant to the author's birth date. Contexts 5, 7, and 8 are even less relevant as they do not provide information about the novel or the author.
idx: [6,2,0,3,4,9,1,7]

step-by-step think:1.

"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (film)" context: This context is relevant because it connects the film to the novel written by Hunter Davies, which is the subject of the claim. It does not provide the birth date but confirms the authorship of the novel, which is pertinent to the question. 3. "Christopher Mitchell (actor)" context: This context mentions the actor who appeared in the film adaptation of the novel but does not provide information about the author or his birth date, making it less relevant. 4. "Roy Holder" context: Similar to the previous context, this one mentions an actor involved in the film but does not provide information about the author or his birth date. 5. "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (Traffic song)" context: This context discusses the song related to the film but does not provide information about the author or his birth date. 6. "Clive Donner" context: This context mentions the director of the film but does not provide information about the author or his birth date. 7. "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush" context: This context talks about the nursery rhyme, which is not directly related to the novel or the author's birth date. 8.

Question:Who died first, George Archainbaud or Ralph Murphy?

"George Archainbaud" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact death date of George Archainbaud, which is crucial to answer the claim. 2. "Ralph Murphy" context: This context is equally important because it gives the exact death date of Ralph Murphy, allowing for a direct comparison with George Archainbaud's death date. 3. "Arthur Roberts (editor)" context: While this context mentions George Archainbaud, it does not provide information about his death date, making it less relevant than the previous two. 4. "Thrill of a Lifetime (film)" context: This context is related to George Archainbaud's work but does not mention his death date, so it is less relevant to the claim. 5. "Hoppy Serves a Writ" context: Similar to the previous context, it is related to George Archainbaud's work but does not provide information on his death date. 6. "Alias French Gertie" context: This context is about a film directed by George Archainbaud but does not provide information on his death date. 7. "The Big Brain" context: Again, this context is about George Archainbaud's work and does not mention his death date. 8. "Criminal Lawyer" context: This context mentions a film directed by George Archainbaud but is not directly relevant to the claim. The remaining contexts are related to George Archainbaud's work but do not provide information about his death date, making them less relevant to the claim.
idx: [3, 0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the comparison of death dates between George Archainbaud and Ralph Murphy. 1. "George Archainbaud" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact death date of George Archainbaud, which is crucial to answer the claim. 2. "Ralph Murphy" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides the exact death date of Ralph Murphy, which is necessary to determine who died first.

Question:Which component of shellite has the formula (ON)CHOH?
golden idx: [4, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the chemical formula (ON)CHOH and its connection to shellite. 1. "Picric acid" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the formula (ON)CHOH and identifies picric acid as a component of shellite. 2. "Shellite (explosive)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses shellite and its components, which is directly related to the claim. 3. "Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride" context: While this context mentions a chemical formula, it does not match the formula in the claim, making it less relevant. 4. "1-Pentanol" context: This context is not relevant as the formula does not match the claim. 5. "Xylitol" context: The formula mentioned here is different from the claim and is therefore less relevant. 6. "Aldonic acid" context: This context discusses a family of sugar acids with a different formula, making it less relevant. 7. "Isopropyl alcohol" context: The formula provided does not match the claim, reducing its relevance. 8. "1-Hexanol" context: This context is not relevant due to the mismatch in the formula. 9. "Index of alcohol-related articles" context: This context is informative about alcohols but does not directly address the claim. 10. "Conductivity near the percolation threshold" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not discuss chemical formulas related to the claim.
idx: [4, 8, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the component of shellite with the formula (ON)CHOH. The only context that directly mentions (ON)CHOH is the context with index 4, which is about Picric acid. This context is highly relevant to the claim and likely contains the answer. Another context that might be relevant is the context with index 8, which is about Shellite. Shellite is an explosive mixture that contains Picric acid, so it is likely that this context also contains information about the component of shellite with the formula (ON)CHOH. Based on these considerations, I will rank the contexts as follows:

It describes Backford Cross as a village located around the A41/A5117 junction, south of Great Sutton, and about 1.5 mi north of the village of Backford. It also mentions that Backford Cross serves as a commuter village to Ellesmere Port and Chester.

2. Looking at context 8, it mentions the A5117 road, which intersects the A41 at Backford Cross. It states that the A5117 forms a northerly bypass to Chester and provides a shorter route between the North West and North Wales than the A55. This context directly relates to the claim and provides information about a major truck road located at Backford Cross.

3. Context 0 mentions FAW vehicles and how Al Haj FAW has secured the trust of major transport and logistics corporations as one of the major truck providers in Pakistan. This context is relevant to the topic of major truck roads, but it does not mention Backford Cross.

4. Context 3 mentions U.S. Route 287, which serves as the major truck route between Fort Worth, Texas, and Amarillo, Texas. It is not directly related to Backford Cross.

5. Context 4 describes the Pureland Industrial Complex, which is a 3000 acre industrial park located in New Jersey. It mentions that Interstate 295, U.S. Route 322, and U.S. Route 130 run through it and connect it to major truck routes. While it mentions major truck routes, it does not mention Backford Cross.

6. Context 5 describes the Portland and Southwestern Railroad Tunnel, an abandoned tunnel in Oregon. It mentions that the tunnel was replaced by a truck road, but it is not directly related to Backford Cross.

7. Context 6 mentions the A41 road, which is a major trunk road in England. It connects various towns and cities including Chester and Ellesmere Port. While it mentions major roads, it does not mention Backford Cross.

8. Context 7 mentions U.S. Route 19 Truck, a truck route located in Western Pennsylvania. It is not related to Backford Cross.

9. Context 9 mentions Strawberry Park and Strawberry Fields, which are suburbs located to the west of Backford Cross. While it mentions the location, it does not provide information about a major truck road.

Based on the above analysis, the top 8 ranked contexts are:

Question:Mummulgum is a stop on the Bruxner Highway before reaching the town on the banks of which river?
golden idx: [2, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine the relevance of each context to the claim, I will analyze the content of each paragraph and its relation to Mummulgum, the Bruxner Highway, and the river mentioned in the claim. 1. "Casino, New South Wales" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Casino, which is the nearest large town to Mummulgum and lies on the banks of the Richmond River. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Richmond Valley Council" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the Richmond River, which flows through the council area and is adjacent to the Bruxner Highway. It may contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Mummulgum" context: This context directly relates to Mummulgum and its location on the Bruxner Highway, but it does not mention the river, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Tabulam" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Tabulam's location on the Bruxner Highway and on the Clarence River, providing a potential answer to the claim. 5. "Bruxner Highway" context: This context is informative about the Bruxner Highway but does not directly mention rivers, making it less likely to contain the answer. 6.

idx: [2,4,8,9,1,0,5,3]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the name of the river that Mummulgum is located on. 
1. Casino, New South Wales context: This context directly mentions Casino, which is a town on the banks of the Richmond River. It is likely that Mummulgum is also located on the Richmond River. This context is both relevant and informative.
2. Mummulgum context: This context explicitly states that Mummulgum is located on Shannon Brook between Tenterfield and Casino on the Bruxner Highway. It is also mentioned that Casino is 27 kilometers east of Mummulgum. This context is both relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.

step-by-step think: The claim asks which film was Oscar-nominated between "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" and "Gimme Shelter," the 1970 Rolling Stones documentary. To rank the contexts, I will prioritize those that mention Oscar nominations or provide information about the films in question. 1.

Context 9 ("Gimme Shelter (1970 film)") provides detailed information about the "Gimme Shelter" documentary, including its screening at the Cannes Film Festival, but does not mention an Oscar nomination, making it informative but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3.

Context 4 ("Baird Bryant") talks about the cameraman for "Gimme Shelter," which is relevant but less direct than the contexts that mention the films' Oscar status. 5. Context 0 ("Altamont Diary") mentions the "Gimme Shelter" documentary but is focused on an album, making it less relevant. 6.

Question:The movies Queen of Blood and Battle Beyond the Sun both contained scenes from what 1959 Soviet feature?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the ones that mention the films "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun" and the 1959 Soviet feature. Context 6 directly mentions "Queen of Blood" and states it was based on the screenplay for the earlier Soviet film "Mechte Navstrechu". Context 3 mentions "Battle Beyond the Sun" as the English-dubbed version of "Nebo Zovyot", a 1959 Soviet science fiction film. Both contexts are highly relevant and likely contain the answer to the claim. Context 4 mentions a 1959 Soviet drama film, which is relevant due to the year but does not directly relate to the claim. Context 7 also mentions a 1959 Soviet film, which makes it potentially relevant. The remaining contexts do not mention the films or the year 1959 and are therefore less relevant.
idx: [6, 3, 4, 7, 0, 1, 2, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the 1959 Soviet feature that both "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun" used scenes from. 1. "Queen of Blood" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that "Queen of Blood" reused special effects footage from the Soviet features "Mechte Navstrechu" and "Nebo Zovyot". Since "Nebo Zovyot" is a 1959 Soviet film, this context is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Battle Beyond the Sun" context: This context is also highly relevant because it states that "Battle Beyond the Sun" is the re-edited U.S. version of "Nebo Zovyot", directly linking it to the 1959 Soviet film in question. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Girl Seeks Father" context: While this is a 1959 Soviet film, it does not seem to be related to the claim as there is no mention of it being used in the other films. 4. "I Was a Satellite of the Sun" context: This is another 1959 Soviet film, but again, there is no direct connection to the claim. 5. Other contexts: The remaining contexts are either not from 1959 or not related to the Soviet feature films mentioned in the claim, making them less relevant.

It also provides the specific year (2009) when the newspaper changed its name from the Reading Evening Post, directly answering the claim. 2. "Maiwand Lion" context: While this context is relevant because it describes the sculpture and war memorial featured in the Forbury Gardens and its historical significance, it does not provide information about the newspaper's name change. 3. "Forbury Gardens" context: This context gives background information about Forbury Gardens, where the Maiwand Lion is located, but does not mention the newspaper or the name change. 4.

Question:What is the name of the Isles who were led by Aonghus Mór and covered a total land area of over 8300 km2?
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the name of the Isles led by Aonghus Mór with a land area over 8300 km2. Context 2 "Kingdom of the Isles" directly mentions the land area and seems to be the most relevant. Context 7 "List of rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles" also refers to the same kingdom and provides a list of rulers which is highly relevant. Context 0 "Aonghus Mór" is about the person mentioned in the claim and his role in the kingdom, so it's quite relevant. Context 8 "Lord of Islay" is related because it mentions Aonghus Mór and the title related to the Isles. The rest of the contexts are about different places and less relevant to the claim. Context 1 "Geography of the Philippines" and Context 3 "List of islands of Tasmania" mention land areas but are about different regions. Context 4 "Protected areas of Himachal Pradesh" and Context 5 "National parks of Taiwan" are also about different areas and not directly related to the claim. Context 6 "Jaluit Atoll" and Context 9 "Ashanti Region" are the least relevant as they are about entirely different locations.
idx: [2, 7, 0, 8, 1, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "Kingdom of the Isles" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Kingdom of the Isles, which is directly related to the claim. It provides detailed historical information about the kingdom and its geographical extent, which includes the land area mentioned in the claim. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Aonghus Mór" context: This context is also relevant because it provides information about Aonghus Mór, who is mentioned in the claim as the leader of the Isles. It gives background on his lineage and his role in the kingdom, which could lead to the answer to the claim. 3. "Lord of Islay" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Aonghus Mór and the title "Lord of Islay," which is associated with the leadership of the Isles. However, it does not provide the specific name of the Isles, making it slightly less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. "List of rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles" context: While this context is informative about the rulers, it does not specifically mention Aonghus Mór or provide the name of the Isles, making it less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim. The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they discuss different geographical locations and do not mention Aonghus Mór or the Kingdom of the Isles.

Question:The lamp used in many lighthouses is similiar to this type of lamp patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand?
golden idx: [0, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is about a lamp used in many lighthouses that is similar to the Argand lamp patented in 1780. Therefore, the most relevant contexts will be those that discuss the Argand lamp and its use in lighthouses or similar lamps used in lighthouses.

1. "Argand lamp" context: This is the most relevant context as it directly describes the Argand lamp, its invention, and features which are central to the claim.
2. "Lewis lamp" context: This context is highly relevant because it describes the Lewis lamp, which is used in lighthouses and is said to have a similar design to the Argand lamp.
3. "Kerosene lamp" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses a type of lamp that might be used in lighthouses, but it does not directly connect to the Argand lamp.
4. "Antoine Quinquet" context: This context is relevant to the extent that it mentions Aimé Argand and his meeting with Antoine Quinquet, which could provide background information related to the claim.
5. "Carbon button lamp" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different type of lamp invented by Nikola Tesla and does not mention its use in lighthouses.
6. "Hollow-cathode lamp" context: This context is not directly relevant to the claim as it discusses a type of lamp used in physics and chemistry, not in lighthouses.
7. "Hefner lamp" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it describes a lamp used in photometry, which is unrelated to lighthouse lamps.
8. "Kudlik" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it describes a traditional oil lamp used by Arctic peoples, not related to the Argand lamp or lighthouses.
9. "Glow switch starter" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a component used with fluorescent lamps, not oil lamps like the Argand lamp.
10. "Trouble light" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it describes a type of lamp used for portable lighting in obscure places, not in lighthouses.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the contexts are ranked as follows:

Question:Are Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya both orchids?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to find contexts that confirm whether Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya are both orchids. 1. "Broughtonia" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Broughtonia is a genus of orchids. 2. "Laeliocattleya" context: This context is equally relevant because it confirms that Laeliocattleya is a nothogenus of orchid hybrids. 3. "Hawkinsara" context: This context is informative as it mentions Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya among other genera, indicating their relation to orchids. 4. "Cattleytonia" context: This context is relevant as it is an intergeneric hybrid involving Cattleya, which is part of Laeliocattleya. 5. "Otaara" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya, but it is less direct than the others. 6. "Broughtonia sanguinea" context: This context is relevant for confirming Broughtonia as an orchid but is specific to one species. 7. "Caladenia" context: This context is about a different genus of orchids and is informative but less relevant to the claim. 8. "Paracaleana" context: This context is about another genus of orchids and is the least relevant to the claim.
idx: [0,9,4,1,8,6,7,2]

step-by-step think:1. "Broughtonia" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Broughtonia is a genus of orchids, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Laeliocattleya" context: This context is equally relevant as it confirms that Laeliocattleya is a nothogenus of orchid hybrids, addressing the other half of the claim. Both contexts are informative and directly answer the question, making them the top candidates. 3. "Hawkinsara" context: While this context mentions Broughtonia and Laelia as parent genera, it is less directly relevant to the claim than the contexts that specifically address each genus individually. 4. "Cattleytonia" context: This context is informative about the hybrid nature of Cattleytonia and mentions Broughtonia, but it does not directly address the claim about both Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya being orchids. 5. "Otaara" context: Similar to Hawkinsara, this context is less directly relevant because it discusses an intergeneric hybrid rather than the specific genera in question. 6. "Broughtonia sanguinea" context: This context provides additional information about a species within the Broughtonia genus, which is somewhat relevant but less so than the context that addresses the genus as a whole. 7. "Caladenia" context: This context discusses a different genus of orchids and does not contribute to answering the claim. 8. "Paracaleana" context: This context is about another genus of orchids and is not relevant to the claim.

2. Context idx 5 ('2014 FIFA World Cup'): This context is relevant because it provides details about the 2014 FIFA World Cup, including the location and dates, which is directly related to the claim about Algeria qualifying for the round of 16.
3. Context idx 3 ('2002 FIFA World Cup'): This context is informative about the 2002 FIFA World Cup but is not relevant to the claim about Algeria's qualification.
4. Context idx 1 ('1991 Rugby World Cup'): This context is about the Rugby World Cup and not the FIFA World Cup, so it is not relevant to the claim.
5. Context idx 4 ('Orvar Bergmark'), idx 0 ('Tertiary Student Rugby League World Cup'), idx 2 ('1968–69 in Belgian football'), and idx 9 ("Switzerland women's national football team"): These contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not pertain to the FIFA World Cup or Algeria's performance in it.

golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the birthplace of the Senator representing New York's 1st State Senate district. Context 1 titled "New York's 1st State Senate district" is the most relevant as it directly mentions the district in question and the current representative, Senator Kenneth LaValle. Context 6 titled "Kenneth LaValle" is the second most relevant as it provides personal information about Senator LaValle, including his birthplace, which is Brooklyn, New York. The other contexts are less relevant as they pertain to other districts, other states, or general information about state senates and nesting of voting districts. Context 0 about the California State Senate and context 2 about nesting (voting districts) are informative but not directly relevant to the claim. Contexts 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are related to different senators or districts and are therefore less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

"New York's 3rd State Senate district" and "New York's 4th State Senate district" contexts: These contexts are about other districts in the New York State Senate and do not mention the first district or Senator Kenneth LaValle, therefore they are not relevant to the claim. 5.

golden idx: [1, 2]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about the Memphis Hustle's location and the population of that suburb in 2010. 1. "Southaven, Mississippi" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Southaven, the suburb where the Memphis Hustle is based, and provides the population number from the 2010 census. 2. "Memphis Hustle" context: This context is directly about the Memphis Hustle and mentions their base location, making it relevant to the claim. 3. "Memphis metropolitan area" context: This context is relevant as it covers the broader area including suburbs of Memphis, which may contain the answer. 4. "West Memphis, Arkansas" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions a location in the Memphis metropolitan area and provides a population figure, but it's not the specific suburb in question. 5. "Olive Branch, Mississippi" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a suburb of Memphis and provides population data, but it's not the specific suburb where the Memphis Hustle is based. 6. "Millington, Tennessee" context: This context is less relevant because, while it mentions a suburb of Memphis, it does not provide the specific information needed for the claim. 7. "Lakeland, Tennessee" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a suburb of Memphis and its population, but again, it's not the specific suburb in question. 8. "Marion, Arkansas" context: This context is relevant to the Memphis area but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. The remaining contexts are either less relevant or not related to the Memphis area and the claim.
idx: [2, 1, 8, 0, 4, 3, 7, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Southaven, Mississippi" context: It directly mentions Southaven, Mississippi, which is a suburb of Memphis, the city mentioned in the claim. It provides information about the population of Southaven in 2010, which is relevant to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.

2. "Memphis Hustle" context: This context directly mentions the Memphis Hustle, which is based in Southaven, Mississippi, a suburb of Memphis. It confirms the location mentioned in the claim and provides information about the team. It is directly relevant to the claim and likely contains the answer.

3. "Memphis metropolitan area" context: This context discusses the Memphis metropolitan area, which includes Southaven, Mississippi and Memphis, Tennessee. It provides information about the population of the Memphis metropolitan area in 2010. While it is informative, it is less directly relevant to the claim compared to the previous two contexts.

4. "West Memphis, Arkansas" context: This context mentions West Memphis, Arkansas, which is part of the Memphis metropolitan area. However, it does not provide direct information about the population of the Memphis metropolitan area in 2010 or the Memphis Hustle, so it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

Based on these considerations, the top 2 ranked contexts are "Southaven, Mississippi" and "Memphis Hustle".

step-by-step think: The claim asks whether Bamboo Mañalac and Danny Jones are both musicians.

Context 8 mentions CBS Television Workshop, which aired on CBS and included James Dean, known for "Rebel Without a Cause," making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 3 mentions James Dean and his iconic role in "Rebel Without a Cause," but does not mention a CBS series, so it's relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer.

"Chronic Respiratory Disease" context: This context is about respiratory diseases in general, which makes it somewhat relevant. 8. "Pulmonary rehabilitation" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases rather than the diseases themselves.
idx: [3, 5, 4, 6, 1, 0, 7, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the full name of the viral respiratory disease related to Yi Guan's research that helped prevent an outbreak. 1. "Yi Guan" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Yi Guan and his research on the viral respiratory disease SARS, which aligns directly with the claim. It provides detailed information about Yi Guan's contribution to preventing the outbreak, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Severe acute respiratory syndrome" context: This context provides detailed information about SARS, including its impact and the timeline of the outbreak, which is directly relevant to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Timeline of the SARS outbreak" context: While this context is relevant as it provides a timeline of the SARS outbreak, it may not be as directly related to Yi Guan's research or the prevention of the outbreak as the first two contexts. 4. "SARS (disambiguation)" context: This context provides a definition of SARS but lacks specific information about Yi Guan or the prevention of the outbreak, making it less relevant than the first two contexts. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not directly address the claim about Yi Guan's research or the specific viral respiratory disease in question.

Question:Which Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame author has had works published by Dim Gray Bar Press?
golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the context that directly mentions Dim Gray Bar Press and any authors associated with it. Context 0 is the most relevant as it not only mentions Dim Gray Bar Press but also lists authors who have had works published by them, including Wendell Berry, who is a Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame author. Context 6 is the second most relevant as it provides information about Wendell Berry, confirming his association with both Dim Gray Bar Press and the Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame. The remaining contexts do not mention Dim Gray Bar Press or the Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame, so they will be ranked based on the likelihood of the authors mentioned being associated with the Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame and Dim Gray Bar Press. Contexts 4 and 7 mention authors inducted into a Writers Hall of Fame, but not the Kentucky one, so they are next in relevance. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not mention any connection to Dim Gray Bar Press or the Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame.
idx: [0, 6, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Dim Gray Bar Press" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Dim Gray Bar Press and lists authors who have had works published by them. It directly addresses the claim by providing a list of authors, one of whom is the answer to the claim. 2. "Wendell Berry" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions that Wendell Berry is a Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame author. Since the Dim Gray Bar Press context also lists Wendell Berry as one of the authors published by them, this context is likely to contain the answer to the claim.

golden idx: [6, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is about a settlement received by a character from the "Son of al Qaeda" in 2017. Context 9 is directly relevant as it mentions Omar Khadr, who is associated with the "Son of al Qaeda" and details the settlement he received in 2017. Context 6 is also relevant as it provides information about the documentary "Son of al Qaeda," which is directly related to the claim. Context 1 mentions a legal action and settlement related to the Al Thani family, which could be confused with "Son of al Qaeda" due to the similar-sounding names, but it is less directly relevant than contexts 9 and 6. Context 2 discusses the duty to settle, which is relevant to the concept of legal settlements but does not provide information about the specific settlement in question. Contexts 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the "Son of al Qaeda" or related settlements.
idx: [9, 6, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the settlement amount received by a character associated with "Son of al Qaeda" in 2017. 1. "Omar Khadr" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Omar Khadr, who is related to the "Son of al Qaeda" through his brother Abdurahman Khadr. It provides specific information about the settlement amount and the year, which directly answers the claim. 2. "Son of al Qaeda" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the documentary "Son of al Qaeda" and provides information about Abdurahman Khadr, whose younger brother is Omar Khadr. However, it does not provide the settlement amount or the year. 3. "Kasia Al Thani" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different person and their legal actions, which are unrelated to the "Son of al Qaeda" or the settlement in question. 4.

Question:Considered the strongest recorded tropical cyclone, which cyclone had a film made about it in 2007?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think:"Cyclone Donna" context: It directly relates to the claim as it mentions "Cyclone Donna" and provides information about its strength and formation. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 

"Cyclone Hondo" context: Although it does not directly mention "Cyclone Donna," it provides information about another cyclone that occurred in 2007. It is relevant and likely contains information that could be helpful in understanding cyclones in that year. 

"2002–03 Australian region cyclone season" context: This context provides information about the Australian region cyclone season in 2002-03. It is not directly related to "Cyclone Donna" in 2007, but it provides background information about cyclones in that region and time period. 

"1999 Odisha cyclone" context: Although it does not directly mention "Cyclone Donna," it provides information about another cyclone that occurred in 1999. It is relevant and likely contains information that could be helpful in understanding cyclones in general. 

"2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season" context: Although it does not directly mention "Cyclone Donna," it provides information about the South Pacific cyclone season in 2011-12. It is relevant and likely contains information that could be helpful in understanding cyclones in that region and time period.

"Cyclone Anne" context: Although it does not directly mention "Cyclone Donna," it provides information about another intense cyclone in the South Pacific basin during the 1980s. It is relevant and likely contains information that could be helpful in understanding intense cyclones in general. 

idx: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the strongest recorded tropical cyclone which also had a film made about it in 2007. Context 6 mentions 'Kathantara', a film made in 2007 about the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which aligns with the claim's requirement of a cyclone with a film made about it. Context 3 discusses the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which is described as the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and among the most destructive in the region, making it highly relevant to the claim. Context 5 mentions Cyclone Gonu as the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea, but there is no mention of a film. Context 1 talks about Cyclone Hondo, which was the strongest during the 2007–08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, but again, there is no mention of a film. Contexts 0, 2, 4, and 7 do not mention any cyclone being the strongest recorded nor do they mention a film, making them less relevant.

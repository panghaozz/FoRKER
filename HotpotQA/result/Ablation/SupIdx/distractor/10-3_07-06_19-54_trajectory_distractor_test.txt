step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about Bordan Tkachuk and the likelihood of them containing the answer to what sort of products the company he was CEO of provides. 1. "Viglen" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Viglen Ltd, the company Bordan Tkachuk was CEO of, and describes the products it provides, which are IT products and services. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Bordan Tkachuk" context: This context is about Bordan Tkachuk himself and mentions his role as the former CEO of Viglen. It is relevant and supports the information provided in the Viglen context. 3. "Compass Minerals" context: Although this context is about a company that provides various mineral-based products and services, it is not directly related to Bordan Tkachuk or Viglen. However, it is informative and might be considered for its detailed description of a company's product offerings. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention Bordan Tkachuk or Viglen and are about different industries and individuals.

golden idx: [4, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a fantasy film starring Sarah Bolger, with a setting in New England where a family discovers magical creatures. 1.

golden idx: [3, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, which is about a 2017 film starring the youngest daughter of Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, Douglas Smith, and Lucien Laviscount. 1. "The Bye Bye Man" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions a 2017 film and includes all three individuals named in the claim. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

Question:Mummulgum is a stop on the Bruxner Highway before reaching the town on the banks of which river?
golden idx: [2, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the river on the banks of which the town Mummulgum is located before reaching it via the Bruxner Highway. 1. "Casino, New South Wales" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Casino lies on the banks of the Richmond River and is situated at the junction of the Bruxner Highway and the Summerland Way. Since Mummulgum is located between Tenterfield and Casino on the Bruxner Highway, this context is likely to contain the answer. 2. "Richmond Valley Council" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the Richmond River, which flows through most of the council area and is adjacent to the Bruxner Highway. This suggests that the river in question could be the Richmond River. 3. "Mummulgum" context: This context directly mentions Mummulgum and its location on the Bruxner Highway, but it does not mention the river, making it less likely to contain the answer than the contexts that mention rivers. However, it is still relevant due to the direct mention of Mummulgum.

golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Greatest Sports Legends" context: This context is directly relevant as it describes the anthology series and mentions athlete hosts, which is likely to include the answer to the claim. 2.

"Babe Ruth" context: Ruth is a significant figure in baseball and a Hall of Fame inductee, but the context does not mention the anthology series. 6. "Eddy Furniss" context: This context discusses Furniss's college career and Hall of Fame inductions, but it is less relevant to the claim. 7.

"Robin Ventura" context: Ventura's context is informative about his career, but it does not mention the anthology series or the specific Hall of Fame induction year. 9.

The series includes titles such as \"Lockdown,\" \"Solitary,\" \"Death Sentence,\" \"Fugitives,\" and \"Execution,\" and is about his experiences in a fictional prison.

It remains one of the largest massacres in Kentucky state history. The settlers were traveling southeast from Low Dutch Station to Harrod's Town. The settler relocation was in part a reaction to British Captain Henry Bird's invasion of Kentucky. The area immediately east of Low Dutch Station had been overrun with British allied Indians. Harrod's Town was fortified and a move south would lead the settlers away from Captain Bird's invading army from the north. The caravan was ambushed in a surprise attack, during the night, after a day's travel of twelve miles. The exact location of the massacre is not definitively known. However, it is likely to have occurred at Floyd's Fork and Broad Run. The caravan was formed by Jacobus Westervelt and consisted of forty-one settlers from ten different families. Ten of the seventeen settlers killed were members of the Westervelt family. The victims included men, women, and children. The Indians responsible for the massacre were allied to the British and received \u20a45 for each victim's scalp cut off and returned to the British authorities. The Indians were thus awarded \u20a485 by the British for massacring the Dutch settlers. The Westervelt Massacre had a chilling effect on the region.

It states that Katherine Waterston is an American actress who portrayed Chrisann Brennan in the film \"Steve Jobs\" in 2015. This directly connects Katherine Waterston to Chrisann Brennan, as she played the role of Brennan in a biographical film, thus establishing a professional link between them.\n\nSecondly, the context at index 5 also provides effective support for the claim. It mentions Lisa Brennan-Jobs, the daughter of Chrisann Brennan and Steve Jobs. Since Katherine Waterston portrayed Chrisann Brennan in the \"Steve Jobs\" film, it can be inferred that she would be associated with the character of Lisa Brennan-Jobs within the narrative of the film. This context supports the claim by highlighting the family connection that Chrisann Brennan has with Lisa Brennan-Jobs, which is a significant part of the story in which Katherine Waterston's portrayal of Chrisann Brennan would be involved.\n\nTherefore, the contexts at index 2 and 5 are the most effective in providing factual support for the claim about the commonality between Katherine Waterston and Chrisann Brennan."}

It states that Sir James Matthew Barrie was born on May 9, 1860, and died on June 19, 1937. This gives us a lifespan of 77 years for J. M.

The mention of her being a producer is particularly relevant because a producer in the music industry often takes on roles similar to those of an impresario, which includes organizing and financing musical projects and events.

Biomimicry is copying the nature while bio-inspired design is learning from nature and making a mechanism that is simpler and more effective than the system observed in nature. Biomimicry has led to the development of a different branch of robotics called soft robotics. The biological systems have been optimized for specific tasks according to their habitat. However, they are multifunctional and are not designed for only one specific functionality. Bio-inspired robotics is about studying biological systems, and look for the mechanisms that may solve a problem in the engineering field.

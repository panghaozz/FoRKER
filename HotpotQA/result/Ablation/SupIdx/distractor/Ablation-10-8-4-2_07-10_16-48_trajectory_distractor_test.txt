step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the government position held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film "Kiss and Tell". 1. "Shirley Temple" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Shirley Temple, who portrayed Corliss Archer, and lists her government positions, directly answering the claim. 2.

step-by-step think: The claim asks for a young adult science fantasy series told in first person, with companion books about enslaved worlds and alien species. 1. "Animorphs" context: This is the most relevant context as it describes a science fantasy series told in first person and includes companion books like "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles," which fits the description of the claim. 2. "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles" context: This context is directly related to the "Animorphs" series and provides details about the companion book that narrates the story of enslaved worlds and alien species. 3. "List of Square Enix companion books" context: While this context talks about companion books, it is related to video games rather than a young adult series, making it less relevant. 4. "Victoria Hanley" context: This context mentions companion books to a fantasy series, but there's no mention of first-person narration or the specific themes of enslaved worlds and alien species. 5.

"Etiquette & Espionage" context: This context is about a young adult novel set in the same universe as an adult series, but it does not fit the claim's criteria of companion books or the specified themes. 7. "Science Fantasy (magazine)" context: This context is less relevant as it is about a magazine and not a young adult series. 8. "Shadowshaper" context: This context is about an urban fantasy young adult novel, but it does not mention companion books or the themes of the claim. 9. "Andre Norton Award" context: This context is about an award for young adult science fiction and fantasy books, which is not directly relevant to the claim. 10.

idx: [8, 6, 1, 2, 4, 0, 3, 7]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about a science fantasy young adult series told in first person with companion books narrating stories of enslaved worlds and alien species. 1. "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles" context: This is highly relevant as it is a companion book to the "Animorphs" series, which fits the claim's description. It narrates the story of enslaved species, directly aligning with the claim. 2. "Animorphs" context: This context is about the main series itself, which is told in first person and is a science fantasy young adult series. It sets the foundation for the companion books. 3. "Science Fantasy (magazine)" context: While this context is about a magazine and not a book series, it shares the genre mentioned in the claim. However, it is less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. 4. "Victoria Hanley" context: This context mentions companion books, but they do not seem to narrate stories of enslaved worlds or alien species, making it less relevant than the first two contexts but still somewhat related to the claim.
idx: [6, 8, 3, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Animorphs" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Animorphs," a science fantasy series of young adult books told in first person, which aligns with the claim. It also discusses the narrative style and themes of the series, making it informative and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles" context: This context is directly related to the "Animorphs" series and provides detailed information about one of its companion books, including narrative perspectives and plot elements involving enslaved worlds and alien species. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Science Fantasy (magazine)" context: While this context discusses a magazine related to science fantasy, it does not pertain to a young adult book series or companion books, making it less relevant to the claim. 4. "Victoria Hanley" context: This context talks about an American young adult fantasy novelist and her books, which are companion books to one another. However, it does not match the claim regarding a series narrated in first person with companion books about enslaved worlds and alien species.

"Sultan Ahmed Mosque" context: This context is informative about the Sultan Ahmed Mosque but does not provide information about the location of the Laleli Mosque or Esma Sultan Mansion, making it less relevant to the claim. 5.

"Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdul Hamid I)" context: This context provides historical information about Esma Sultan but does not address the location of the mansion, making it less relevant. 7. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdülaziz)" context: Similar to context 6, this context provides historical information about another Esma Sultan but does not contribute to the claim about the locations. 8. "Djamaâ el Kebir" context: This context is about a mosque in Algiers, which is not relevant to the claim about locations in Istanbul.

It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim about the neighborhood. 2. "Esma Sultan Mansion" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions the Esma Sultan Mansion and provides its location at Bosphorus in Ortaköy neighborhood of Istanbul, which is necessary to determine if it's in the same neighborhood as the Laleli Mosque. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Gevheri Kadın" context: This context is less relevant because it focuses on the biography of Gevheri Kadın and does not provide information about the location of the Laleli Mosque or Esma Sultan Mansion. 4. "Sultan Ahmed Mosque" context: This context is informative about the Sultan Ahmed Mosque but does not provide information about the neighborhood in relation to the Laleli Mosque or Esma Sultan Mansion, making it less relevant to the claim.

Context index 0 discusses the history of the Kansas City metropolitan area, which is less directly relevant but still related to the location of the branch campuses. 6.

3. "University of Missouri–Kansas City" context: This context mentions the University of Missouri–Kansas City, which is part of the claim. However, it is less relevant compared to the previous two contexts because it focuses more on the university itself rather than the fight song. It is still informative and might contain some relevant information.
4. "Kansas City metropolitan area" context: This context provides information about the Kansas City metropolitan area, which is mentioned in the claim. However, it is less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous three contexts because it is more general and does not specifically focus on the fight song or the university.

Question:Brown State Fishing Lake is in a country that has a population of how many inhabitants ?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: The relevant contexts for the claim are Brown County, Kansas
and Shawnee State Fishing Lake. Both of these places are mentioned in the claim and are likely to contain information about the population of Brown State Fishing Lake. The other contexts are less likely to contain information about the population of Brown State Fishing Lake.

idx: [0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about Brown State Fishing Lake and the likelihood of containing the answer regarding the population of the country it is in.
1. Context 0 ("Brown County, Kansas"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Brown County in Kansas, which is likely to be related to Brown State Fishing Lake. It provides population data, but for the county, not the country. However, since it's the only context that directly relates to the location in question, it's the most likely to contain the answer or lead to it.
2. Context 3 ("Osage State Fishing Lake"): This context is about a fishing lake in Kansas, which is the same state as Brown State Fishing Lake. It doesn't provide population data but is geographically relevant.
3. Context 2 ("Shawnee State Fishing Lake"): Similar to context 3, this context is about another fishing lake in Kansas. It is relevant due to the geographic proximity and the similar nature of the location.
4. Context 6 ("Higgins Lake, Michigan"): This context is about a lake in Michigan, another U.S. state. It's less relevant than the Kansas contexts but still within the same country, which is pertinent to the population question.
The other contexts are about locations in Canada and are not relevant to the claim about a lake in the U.S. Therefore, they are not ranked in the top four.
idx: [0, 3, 2, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Brown County, Kansas" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Brown County's population and is likely to contain the answer to the claim about the population in the country where Brown State Fishing Lake is located. 2. "Osage State Fishing Lake" context: While this context is about a fishing lake in Kansas, it does not provide population information, making it less relevant than the Brown County context. 3. "Shawnee State Fishing Lake" context: Similar to the Osage Lake context, this context discusses another fishing lake in Kansas but does not mention population data, so it is less relevant to the claim. 4. "Higgins Lake, Michigan" context: This context is about a location in Michigan and does not provide any population information, making it the least relevant to the claim.

Question:The Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team currently competes in a conference that was formerly known as what from 1988 to 1996?
golden idx: [4, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the former name of the conference in which the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team competes. The context that directly answers this is the one that mentions the historical names of the conference. 1. "America East Conference" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the former name of the conference, the North Atlantic Conference, during the specified period from 1988 to 1996. It is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Vermont Catamounts men's soccer" context: This context is relevant because it pertains to the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team, but it does not mention the historical name of the conference, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to the first context. 3. "2010–11 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: This context mentions the America East Conference but does not provide historical information about its name, making it less relevant. 4. "2016–17 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: Similar to the previous context, it mentions the America East Conference but lacks historical naming information. 5. "2015–16 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: This context also mentions the America East Conference but does not address the historical aspect of the claim. 6. "2012–13 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: Again, this context is about the America East Conference but does not mention its former name. 7. "2013–14 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: This context is relevant to the America East Conference but not to the historical name. 8. "2011–12 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: This context is relevant due to the mention of the America East Conference but does not provide the historical name. The remaining contexts are about men's basketball and men's ice hockey, which are less relevant to the claim about the men's soccer team's conference history.
idx: [4,5,0,1,2,3,6,7]

step-by-step think:1. "America East Conference" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the North Atlantic Conference, which is the former name of the conference in which the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team competes. It provides specific information about the time period in question (1988 to 1996). 2. "Vermont Catamounts men's soccer" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the team and the conference they compete in, but it does not mention the former name of the conference. 3. "2010–11 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on the basketball team and their achievements within the America East Conference, without mentioning the former name of the conference. 4. "2016–17 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: Similar to the previous context, this one is also less relevant because it discusses the basketball team's performance and does not provide information about the former name of the conference. The remaining contexts are related to the Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team in different years and do not provide information about the former name of the conference, making them less relevant to the claim.
idx: [4, 5, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "America East Conference" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the history of the conference's names, including the specific time period from 1988 to 1996, which aligns with the claim. It is informative and directly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Vermont Catamounts men's soccer" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the team and the conference they compete in. However, it does not provide historical information about the conference name changes, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to the first context. 3. "2010–11 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: While this context mentions the America East Conference, it focuses on the basketball team's season and does not provide information about the conference's history or name changes. 4. "2016–17 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team" context: Similar to the previous context, this one also discusses the basketball team's season and their achievements within the America East Conference but does not address the historical aspect of the conference's name, which is crucial to the claim.

Question:Are Giuseppe Verdi and Ambroise Thomas both Opera composers ?
golden idx: [4, 5]

Context idx 4: Directly confirms Giuseppe Verdi as an opera composer. 2. Context idx 5: Directly confirms Ambroise Thomas as an opera composer. 3. Context idx 2: Mentions both composers in the context of opera, linking them to the claim. 4. Context idx 6: References operas by both composers, supporting their roles as opera composers. 5. Context idx 9: Lists major opera composers, likely to confirm the claim. 6. Context idx 0: Discusses Giuseppe Verdi's life, indirectly supporting the claim. 7. Context idx 7: Focuses on Giuseppe Verdi's life, less directly related to the claim. 8. Context idx 1: Mentions Verdi's early tutor, less relevant but still informative. The remaining contexts are less directly related to the claim or do not mention both composers.
idx: [4, 5, 2, 6, 9, 0, 7, 1]

step-by-step think: 
1. "Giuseppe Verdi" context: This context directly mentions Giuseppe Verdi, who is one of the opera composers mentioned in the claim. It provides information about Verdi being an Italian opera composer. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. "Ambroise Thomas" context: This context directly mentions Ambroise Thomas, who is the other opera composer mentioned in the claim. It provides information about Thomas being a French composer known for his operas. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. "Armand Castelmary" context: This context mentions Armand Castelmary, who created a role in Ambroise Thomas's opera "Hamlet." Although it indirectly relates to the claim by mentioning Thomas's opera, it is less relevant and less likely to provide the direct answer to the claim.
4. "List of major opera composers" context: This context provides a general list of major opera composers and briefly mentions Verdi and Thomas. Although it provides some background information, it is less likely to directly answer the claim compared to the contexts specifically mentioning Verdi and Thomas.
idx: [4, 5, 2, 9]

step-by-step think:1. "Giuseppe Verdi" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms Giuseppe Verdi's identity as an Italian opera composer, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Ambroise Thomas" context: Similarly, this context is highly relevant as it confirms Ambroise Thomas's identity as a French composer known for his operas, addressing the other half of the claim. Both contexts are informative and directly provide the answer to the claim. 3. "Armand Castelmary" context: While this context mentions both Verdi and Thomas, it focuses on Armand Castelmary, an operatic bass, and his roles in operas by these composers. It is less directly relevant to the claim about the composers themselves. 4. "List of major opera composers" context: This context provides a list of significant opera composers, which may include Verdi and Thomas, but it does not directly confirm their identities as opera composers. It is informative but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention Verdi and Thomas.

Question:Which writer was from England, Henry Roth or Robert Erskine Childers?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine the ranking, I will evaluate each context based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Robert Erskine Childers" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms Robert Erskine Childers was a British writer, directly answering the claim. 2. "Henry Roth" context: This context is relevant as it identifies Henry Roth as an American writer, which helps to distinguish between the two writers in question. 3. "Robert Caesar Childers" context: This context is informative as it provides background on Robert Erskine Childers' father, indicating the family's British origins. 4. "Gretchen Osgood Warren" context: This context mentions Robert Erskine Childers as an Irish nationalist, which is indirectly relevant to the claim. 5.

"Asgard (yacht)" context: This context mentions Erskine Childers' yacht, which is less directly relevant but still provides information about his activities. The remaining contexts are either too indirectly related or do not provide additional information pertinent to the claim.
idx: [9, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Robert Erskine Childers" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Erskine Childers was a British writer, directly answering the claim about which writer was from England. 2. "Henry Roth" context: This context is relevant because it identifies Henry Roth as an American novelist, which helps to distinguish the nationalities of the two writers in question. 3. "Robert Caesar Childers" context: This context is informative as it provides background on Robert Erskine Childers' father, who was a British scholar, adding to the understanding of Erskine Childers' British heritage. 4. "Gretchen Osgood Warren" context: This context is less directly related to the claim but is included because it mentions Robert Erskine Childers and provides additional information about his family connections, which may be useful for understanding his background.
idx: [9, 0, 4, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Robert Erskine Childers" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Erskine Childers was a British writer, directly addressing the claim about the writer's nationality. It provides comprehensive information about his life, works, and family background. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

Question:Which other Mexican Formula One race car driver has held the podium besides the Force India driver born in 1990?
golden idx: [3, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for Mexican Formula One drivers who have held the podium besides the Force India driver born in 1990, who is Sergio Pérez. Context 3 is the most relevant as it mentions Sergio Pérez and his podium finishes. Context 8 is next, as it details a race where Sergio Pérez finished on the podium. Context 9 is also relevant because it provides information about Sergio Pérez himself. Context 0 mentions Eduardo Troconis, a Mexican driver, but does not mention any podium finishes, so it's less relevant. Context 1 talks about a specific Grand Prix but does not mention Mexican drivers or podium finishes. Contexts 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are not relevant as they do not mention Mexican drivers or podium finishes in Formula One.
idx: [3,8,9,0,1,2,4,5]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both Pedro Rodríguez and Sergio Pérez, indicating that Rodríguez is the most successful Mexican driver and the only one to have won a grand prix, while Pérez is noted as the only other Mexican to finish on the podium. This directly answers the claim. 2. Context idx 9: This context is about Sergio Pérez and confirms his nationality and association with Force India, which is relevant to the claim but does not provide information about other Mexican drivers. 3. Context idx 8: This context mentions Sergio Pérez finishing on the podium in the 2014 Bahrain Grand Prix, which is relevant but less informative regarding other Mexican drivers. 4. Context idx 0: This context is about Eduardo Troconis, a Mexican race car driver, but does not mention any Formula One achievements, making it less relevant to the claim.
idx: [3,9,8,0]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for Mexican Formula One drivers who have held the podium besides Sergio Pérez, who was born in 1990 and drives for Force India. 1. "Formula One drivers from Mexico" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Pedro Rodríguez, a successful Mexican driver who won a grand prix, and Sergio Pérez, who has finished on the podium. It directly addresses the claim by listing Mexican drivers with podium finishes. 2. "2014 Bahrain Grand Prix" context: This context mentions Sergio Pérez finishing third at the Bahrain Grand Prix, which is relevant but does not provide information about other Mexican drivers. 3. "Sergio Pérez" context: This context focuses on Sergio Pérez's biography and current team, which is less relevant to the claim since it does not mention other drivers. 4. "Eduardo Troconis" context: This context is about Eduardo Troconis, a Mexican race car driver, but it does not mention any Formula One podium finishes, making it the least relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [4, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" and the voice of a hedgehog. 1. Context idx 9: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the song "A Rather Blustery Day" and identifies Jim Cummings as the singer. Since the claim asks for the singer who also voiced a hedgehog, this context is likely to contain the answer. 2.

Context idx 0: This context mentions the featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" but focuses on a different aspect. It is less relevant. 8. Context idx 1: This context talks about Tigger's song and mentions "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day", but it is less directly related to the claim. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim and are therefore ranked lower.
idx: [9, 4, 2, 7, 3, 5, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" who also voiced a hedgehog character. To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the song "A Rather Blustery Day," the mention of Jim Cummings (the singer), and any reference to voicing a hedgehog character.
1. Context idx 4 ("Jim Cummings"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Jim Cummings, the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day," and also mentions that he voiced Dr. Robotnik from "Sonic the Hedgehog," who is a hedgehog character. This context is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 9 ("A Rather Blustery Day"): This context is relevant because it mentions the song "A Rather Blustery Day" and that Jim Cummings sang it. However, it does not mention the hedgehog character, making it slightly less relevant than context idx 4.
3. Context idx 7 ("Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day"): This context is relevant as it provides information about the featurette in which "A Rather Blustery Day" appears. It is informative but does not directly answer the claim about the hedgehog character.
4. Context idx 2 ("Kate Higgins"): This context is less relevant to the claim. It mentions Kate Higgins, another voice actor, and her roles, including voicing a character in "Sonic the Hedgehog." However, she is not the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day," so it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not mention Jim Cummings or the hedgehog character.
idx: [4, 9, 7, 2]

step-by-step think:

1. "A Rather Blustery Day" context: This context directly mentions the movie "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" and the song "A Rather Blustery Day", which is part of the claim. It provides information about the song and the actor who voiced the character of Pooh. It is highly relevant, informative, and likely contains the answer to the claim.

2. "Jim Cummings" context: This context mentions Jim Cummings, the voice actor who has voiced characters like Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, and the title character from "Darkwing Duck". It also mentions that he voiced Dr. Robotnik from "Sonic the Hedgehog". Although it doesn't directly mention the movie or the song, it provides relevant information about the actor who voiced the character of Pooh. It is highly informative and likely contains additional relevant information about the claim.

3. "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" context: This context provides information about the 1968 animated featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" and its connection to the "Winnie-the-Pooh" books. It mentions that the movie includes chapters from the books by A. A. Milne, and it was produced by Walt Disney Productions. While it doesn't directly mention the song or the actor, it provides background information that is relevant to the claim. It is informative and likely contains additional relevant information about the claim.

Based on these rankings, the top 2 ranked contexts are:

Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments and the number of people in each act. Context 0 provides information about Wolf Alice, stating they are a four-piece band, which suggests four instruments. Context 2 mentions Badly Drawn Boy is a multi-instrumentalist, but does not specify the number of instruments he plays. Context 8 details that Badly Drawn Boy played several instruments on his album, which could suggest a higher instrument to person ratio for Badly Drawn Boy. However, the exact number of instruments is not provided. The other contexts do not provide specific information about the number of instruments or the setup of the performances. Therefore, the ranking is based on the likelihood of the context containing information about the number of instruments relative to the number of people in each act.
idx: [0, 2, 8, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments compared to the number of people in each act. 1. "Badly Drawn Boy" context: This context indicates that Badly Drawn Boy is a stage name for a single individual, Damon Gough, who is a multi-instrumentalist. This suggests a high instrument to person ratio since one person plays several instruments. 2. "The Hour of Bewilderbeast" context: This context supports the first context by detailing that Damon Gough wrote, produced, and played several instruments on the album's tracks, indicating a high instrument to person ratio. 3. "Wolf Alice" context: This context describes Wolf Alice as a four-piece band, which implies a lower instrument to person ratio compared to a solo multi-instrumentalist. 4. "Badly Drawn Boy discography" context: This context provides additional information about Badly Drawn Boy's music career, including the number of albums and singles, which may indirectly suggest the variety of instruments he has used throughout his career.
idx: [2,8,0,4]

step-by-step think:1. "Badly Drawn Boy" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Badly Drawn Boy and describes him as a multi-instrumentalist, which is directly related to the claim about instrument to person ratio. 2. "The Hour of Bewilderbeast" context: This context is also relevant because it details the debut album of Badly Drawn Boy, where he played several instruments, indicating a high instrument to person ratio. 3. "Wolf Alice" context: This context is relevant as it mentions that Wolf Alice is a four-piece band, which provides necessary information to determine the instrument to person ratio for comparison. 4. "Badly Drawn Boy discography" context: While this context provides extensive information about Badly Drawn Boy's discography, it is less directly related to the claim about the instrument to person ratio compared to the other contexts.

Context from 'Abraham Maslow': This context is relevant as it mentions that Maslow was also a professor at Columbia University, which is the same university where Hefferline taught. 4. Context from 'E. Mavis Hetherington': This context is less relevant because it talks about a different psychology professor and a different university. However, it is included because it is informative about the field of psychology and academia. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Hefferline or Columbia University.
idx: [6, 8, 9, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "Ralph Hefferline" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Ralph Hefferline and states that he was a psychology professor at Columbia University. It directly addresses the claim and is likely to contain the answer to the question about the city where the university is located. 2.

"Collie" context: While this context talks about the Collie breed in general, which includes the Scotch Collie, it does not specifically mention the Gordon and Irish Setters, making it less relevant than the Scotch Collie context. 3. "English Setter" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the Setter family, which includes the Gordon and Irish Setters, but it does not directly link these to the Scotch Collie or Manchester Terrier. 4. "Florence Nagle" context: This context mentions Irish Setters and their breeding, which is somewhat relevant but does not directly answer the claim about the Scotch Collie or Manchester Terrier's ancestors. 5.

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the headquarters of the company where Sachin Warrier worked as a software engineer. Context 1 mentions Sachin Warrier's career and states that he worked as a software engineer at Tata Consultancy Services in Kochi, which is relevant but does not mention the headquarters. Context 2 is about Tata Consultancy Services and states that it is headquartered in Mumbai, Maharashtra, which directly answers the claim. None of the other contexts mention Sachin Warrier's employment or the headquarters of the company he worked for, making them less relevant. Therefore, context 2 should be ranked highest, followed by context 1 for its direct relevance to Sachin Warrier's employment.
idx: [1, 0]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about Sachin Warrier's employer and the likelihood of the context containing the answer about the company's headquarters. 1. "Tata Consultancy Services" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions TCS, the company where Sachin Warrier worked, and states that it is headquartered in Mumbai, Maharashtra. It directly answers the claim. 2. "Sachin Warrier" context: This context is relevant because it mentions that Sachin Warrier worked as a software engineer at Tata Consultancy Services in Kochi, which leads to the company in question. 3. "Muthuchippi Poloru" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on Sachin Warrier's work as a singer and composer, but it is connected to him and mentions his debut movie, which could lead to information about his employment. 4. "Divya S. Menon" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions Sachin Warrier in the context of singing, which is related to his profile but does not directly answer the claim. 5. "Kanave Kalayathe" context: This context mentions Sachin Warrier but is focused on an album, making it less relevant to the claim about his employer's headquarters. 6. "Sachin Bansal" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different Sachin who is associated with Flipkart, not TCS. 7. "Wes McKinney" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different software engineer and his work, unrelated to Sachin Warrier or TCS. 8. "Lead programmer" context: This context is not directly relevant as it describes a job role rather than a specific company or individual. 9. "Alec Muffett" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different software engineer and his work, unrelated to Sachin Warrier or TCS. 10. "William Connolley" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different software engineer and his work, unrelated to Sachin Warrier or TCS.
idx: [1, 0, 2, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. The context from 'Tata Consultancy Services' is highly relevant as it mentions the company's headquarters, which is the direct answer to the claim. 2. The context from 'Sachin Warrier' is relevant because it confirms that Sachin Warrier worked as a software engineer at TCS, which is the company in question, and mentions its location in Kochi, which could lead to confusion about the headquarters. However, it does not directly answer the claim about the headquarters' location. 3. The contexts from 'Muthuchippi Poloru' and 'Divya S. Menon' are not relevant to the claim as they do not provide information about TCS or its headquarters.

Question:A Japanese manga series based on a 16 year old high school student Ichitaka Seto, is written and illustrated by someone born in what year?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify which contexts mention the manga series "I"s" and its creator, as the question is specifically about the birth year of the person who wrote and illustrated a series featuring Ichitaka Seto. Context 4 directly mentions "I"s" and the main character Ichitaka Seto, making it highly relevant. Context 6 mentions Masakazu Katsura, the creator of "I"s", and provides his birth year, which is the answer to the claim. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative. The other contexts, while they may mention Japanese manga or manga artists, do not pertain to "I"s" or Masakazu Katsura, and therefore are less relevant. However, they will be ranked based on the slight possibility that they could contain tangential information related to the claim.

idx: [6, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, the informativeness, and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context idx 4: This context is directly relevant as it mentions "I"s", the manga series in question, and Masakazu Katsura, the author and illustrator. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 6: This context is about Masakazu Katsura, the creator of "I"s", and provides his birth year, which is directly relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 5: This context is about another manga series and its author, which is less relevant than the contexts directly related to "I"s" and Masakazu Katsura. However, it is still informative about manga. 4. Context idx 2: This context is about "The Kindaichi Case Files", another manga series, which makes it somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts about "I"s" and Masakazu Katsura. The remaining contexts are about different manga series and authors and do not mention "I"s" or Masakazu Katsura, making them less relevant to the claim.
idx: [4, 6, 5, 2]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the birth year of the author who wrote and illustrated a manga series about a character named Ichitaka Seto. 1. "Masakazu Katsura" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Masakazu Katsura, the author of the manga series "I"s", which includes the character Ichitaka Seto. It also provides the exact birth date of Masakazu Katsura, which directly answers the claim. 2. "I&quot;s" context: This context is relevant because it describes the manga series "I"s" and its main character, Ichitaka Seto. While it does not directly provide the birth year of the author, it is closely related to the claim and is written by the same author mentioned in the claim. 3. "Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto" context: This context is about a different manga series and author, and while it is informative about that series, it does not contain the answer to the claim. 4. "The Kindaichi Case Files" context: Similar to the previous context, this one is about a different manga series and does not provide information relevant to the claim about Masakazu Katsura's birth year.

Context 1: Mentions Joe Biden as Vice President and his staff, which is relevant to the role of Vice Presidents but does not directly address the claim. 5. Context 0: Discusses a Vice President of a company, not relevant to the claim about U.S. Vice Presidents. 6. Context 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: These contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Alfred Balk, the Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media, or the Vice Presidents in question.
idx: [4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Alfred Balk" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Alfred Balk's role as secretary of a committee on employment of minority groups in the news media, which is directly related to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer since it specifies the committee was under New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who was also a Vice President of the United States. 2. "Nelson Rockefeller" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about Nelson Rockefeller's tenure as Vice President, which is the time frame relevant to the claim. It may contain the answer since it is connected to Alfred Balk's service. 3. "Executive Order 10925" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different committee on equal employment opportunity, chaired by Lyndon Johnson, another Vice President. It is informative but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. 4.

It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 8. "President pro tempore of the United States Senate" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses the role of the president pro tempore of the Senate, which is unrelated to the Vice Presidency or the committee mentioned in the claim. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [4, 3, 2, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim is about Alfred Balk serving as the secretary of a committee on employment of minority groups in the news media under a specific U.S. Vice President. 1.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about a medieval fortress in Dirleton bordering a coastal area. 1. Context 5 (Yellowcraigs): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Yellowcraig being bordered to the south by Dirleton and Dirleton Castle, which directly answers the claim. 2. Context 3 (Lord Haliburton of Dirleton): This context is relevant because it mentions Dirleton Castle, providing historical context which is likely to contain the answer. 3. Context 9 (Dirleton Castle): This context is about Dirleton Castle itself, providing specific information about its location and history. 4. Context 7 (Dirleton Kirk): This context mentions Dirleton's location in relation to the Firth of Forth, which is the coastal area in question. 5. Context 0 (Scottish Borders): This context is less directly relevant but includes geographical information about the area surrounding East Lothian. 6. Context 8 (Lothian and Borders): This context provides broader geographical information that includes East Lothian. 7. Context 4 (St. Mary's Priory): This context is informative about the region's history but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. 8. Context 1 (John Home Robertson): This context mentions a political figure associated with East Lothian, which is less directly relevant but still informative about the area.
idx: [5,3,9,7,0,8,4,1]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered their relevance to the claim about a medieval fortress in Dirleton bordering a coastal area. 1. "Yellowcraigs" context: This is the most relevant as it directly mentions the coastal area bordering Dirleton and Dirleton Castle. It is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Dirleton" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the village of Dirleton and its surrounding areas, including Yellowcraigs and the Firth of Forth. It is likely to contain the answer. 3. "Dirleton Castle" context: This context is about the medieval fortress mentioned in the claim and provides its location relative to other areas, which could be useful for answering the claim. 4. "Dirleton Kirk" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Dirleton's location near the Firth of Forth, which is a coastal area. It is less directly related to the claim but still informative. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not directly mention the coastal area or are too broad, discussing larger regions or unrelated individuals.
idx: [5, 3, 9, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Yellowcraigs" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the coastal area of Yellowcraig, which is bordered to the south by the village of Dirleton and Dirleton Castle, directly addressing the claim about the medieval fortress in Dirleton. It is informative and very likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Dirleton" context: This context is relevant because it describes the location of Dirleton and its surrounding areas, including Yellowcraigs, which is necessary to understand the geographical relationship mentioned in the claim. However, it is less direct than the "Yellowcraigs" context in answering the specific question about the coastal area bordering the south side of the fortress. 3. "Dirleton Castle" context: While this context provides historical information about Dirleton Castle, it does not mention its relationship to the coastal area, making it less relevant to the claim. 4. "Dirleton Kirk" context: This context gives the location of Dirleton Kirk in relation to Dirleton and other landmarks but does not provide information about the coastal area in question, making it the least relevant to the claim.

Question:Which British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II?
golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. Context 5 mentions the English Electric Canberra, which fits the description of a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. Although it states that it was introduced in 1951, which is after World War II, it is the most relevant context to the claim. Context 6 is about the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and is likely to contain information about the bombers used, making it the second most relevant. Context 1 describes the South West Pacific Area command and could contain information about the aircraft used, ranking it third. Context 3 mentions a commander's service in the South West Pacific Theatre, which might include details about the bombers, placing it fourth. Context 7 discusses the Asiatic-Pacific Theater and might have relevant information, so it is fifth. Context 4 is about No. 12 Squadron RAAF, which operated in the South West Pacific theatre, making it sixth. Context 8 is about No. 2 Squadron RAAF, which also saw action in the theatre, ranking it seventh. Context 2 is about an American fighter pilot, which is less likely to contain information about British bombers, so it is eighth.
idx: [5,6,1,3,7,4,8,2]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. 1. "English Electric Canberra" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the English Electric Canberra, a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. However, it states that the Canberra was introduced in May 1951, which is after World War II, thus it's not the answer to the claim. 2. "No. 12 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is relevant because it mentions a squadron that operated as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. It could potentially contain information about the specific aircraft used. 3. "No. 2 Squadron RAAF" context: Similar to context 3, this context is relevant as it discusses a squadron that saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and mentions the use of English Electric Canberra jets, but again, this was post-World War II. 4. "South West Pacific theatre of World War II" context: This context is relevant as it describes the theatre of operation but does not mention specific aircraft. 5. "South West Pacific Area (command)" context: This context is informative about the command structure in the South West Pacific theatre but less likely to contain the answer to the claim about a specific bomber aircraft. 6. "Asiatic-Pacific Theater" context: This context provides information on the broader Pacific theatre and command structure but is less directly related to the claim. 7. "Coastwatchers" context: This context is informative about intelligence operations in the Pacific theatre but is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 8. "Edwin A. Doss" context: This context is about an individual's service in the South West Pacific Theatre but does not mention specific bomber aircraft.
idx: [3,8,6,1]

step-by-step think:1. "No. 2 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the squadron's operations in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and specifically notes that they were equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, which is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "No. 12 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is relevant because it discusses a squadron that operated as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. However, it does not specify the type of bombers used, making it slightly less likely to contain the answer compared to the context that mentions the English Electric Canberra. 3. "South West Pacific theatre of World War II" context: While this context provides a broad overview of the theatre, it does not mention specific aircraft or squadrons, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "South West Pacific Area (command)" context: This context describes the command structure and the areas included in the South West Pacific Theatre but does not provide information on specific aircraft, making it the least likely to contain the answer to the claim.

idx: [1, 7, 5, 9, 0, 8, 6, 4]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about Ellie Goulding's collaboration with other writers on her album "Delirium," as well as the likelihood of the context containing the answer. 

1. Context idx 7 ("On My Mind (Ellie Goulding song)"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions the song "On My Mind" from the album "Delirium" and lists the writers involved, directly answering the claim.

2. Context idx 1 ("Love Me like You Do"): This context is relevant because it includes the song "Love Me like You Do," which is part of the "Delirium" album, and names the writers, which is informative and likely to contain the answer to the claim.

3. Context idx 5 ("Delirium (Ellie Goulding album)"): This context talks about the album "Delirium" itself, providing general information about the album and its singles, which makes it likely to contain information about the writers involved in the album.

4. Context idx 0 ("Army (Ellie Goulding song)"): This context is relevant as it discusses the song "Army" from the "Delirium" album, but it does not mention the writers, making it slightly less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous contexts.

The remaining contexts are less directly related to the claim as they do not mention the writers or the process of creating the album "Delirium."

"Row, Row, Row Your Boat" context: This context presents information about the nursery rhyme "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" but does not directly relate to the claim about the nursery rhyme inspiring "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" It is informative but less likely to contain the answer compared to the context directly related to the claim.

"Did You Ever See a Lassie?" context: This context discusses a different folk song and nursery rhyme but does not directly mention or relate to the claim about the nursery rhyme inspiring "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" It is less likely to contain the answer.

idx: [0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the Roud Folk Song Index of the nursery rhyme that inspired "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" which is closely related to the nursery rhyme "What Are Little Boys Made Of?" due to the similar themes and structure. Therefore, the context with the title "What Are Little Boys Made Of?" is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. The other nursery rhymes listed are less relevant to the specific claim, but their Roud Folk Song Index numbers are still valuable information. The context titled "Billy Boy" is somewhat relevant as it is a traditional folk song and nursery rhyme, and it has a low Roud Folk Song Index number, indicating it is an older rhyme which could be related to the claim. The contexts titled "Pretty Little Dutch Girl" and "Aiken Drum" are also nursery rhymes with Roud Folk Song Index numbers, which makes them potentially useful, but less so than the context directly related to the claim. The remaining contexts are related to nursery rhymes but are less likely to contain the answer to the claim due to their higher Roud Folk Song Index numbers or less direct relevance.

"Billy Boy" context: While this context provides a Roud Folk Song Index number, the title of the nursery rhyme does not match the one in the claim, making it less relevant. 4. "Aiken Drum" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a Scottish folk song with a different title and theme, making it unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:What is the inhabitant of the city where  122nd SS-Standarte was formed in2014
golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for the inhabitant of the city where the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in 2014. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions the 122nd SS-Standarte and the city it was formed in. Context 5 directly mentions the 122nd SS-Standarte and states it was formed in Strasbourg, which is crucial information for answering the claim. Context 8 provides detailed information about Strasbourg, including its population in 2014, which is directly relevant to the claim. The other contexts are less relevant as they pertain to different 122nd units or divisions and do not provide information about Strasbourg or its inhabitants. Therefore, they are ranked lower in relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

idx: [5,8,6,7,3,2,1,4]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the inhabitants of the city where the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in 2014. However, there seems to be a discrepancy as the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed during World War II, not in 2014. Therefore, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the city where the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed and the information about its inhabitants.
1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 122nd SS-Standarte and states that it was formed in Strasbourg. It provides historical information about the Standarte but does not mention the inhabitants directly.
2. Context idx 8: This context is also highly relevant because it provides detailed information about Strasbourg, including the number of inhabitants in 2014, which directly answers the claim.
3. Context idx 1: This context is about the 122nd Infantry Regiment of the United States Army and is not relevant to the claim about the 122nd SS-Standarte or the inhabitants of Strasbourg.
4. Context idx 2: This context discusses the 122nd Hydroplane Liaison Squadron of the Yugoslav Air Force, which is unrelated to the claim.
5. Context idx 3: This context talks about the 122nd Battalion, CEF, a Canadian unit, which is not relevant to the claim.
6. Context idx 4: This context is about the 122nd Fighter Squadron of the Louisiana Air National Guard, which is not relevant to the claim.
7. Context idx 6: This context discusses the 122nd Fighter Aviation Squadron of the Yugoslav Air Force, which is unrelated to the claim.
8. Context idx 7: This context is about the 122nd Ohio Infantry, an American Civil War regiment, which is not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the top four contexts are:
idx: [8, 5, 1, 2]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the inhabitants of the city where the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in 2014. 1. "122nd SS-Standarte" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the formation of the 122nd SS-Standarte in Strasbourg, directly linking to the claim. However, it does not provide the population information for 2014. 2. "Strasbourg" context: This context provides detailed information about the city of Strasbourg, including the population in 2014, which directly answers the claim. It is highly relevant and informative. 3. "122nd Infantry Regiment (United States)" context: This context is about an infantry regiment of the United States Army and is not relevant to the claim about the 122nd SS-Standarte or the city's inhabitants. 4. "122nd Hydroplane Liaison Squadron" context: This context discusses a hydroplane squadron of the Yugoslav Air Force and is not relevant to the claim about the 122nd SS-Standarte or the city's inhabitants.

Question:What color clothing do people of the Netherlands wear during Oranjegekte or to celebrate the national holiday Koningsdag? 
golden idx: [0, 4]
step-by-step think: At first, we can rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim. The context with the title "Oranjegekte" is the only context that directly mentions the Netherlands and clothing, so it is the most relevant. The context with the title "Koningsdag" also mentions the national holiday in the Netherlands, so it is the second most relevant. Other contexts do not directly relate to the claim, so their relevance scores are lower.

After ranking based on relevance, we can consider the likelihood of each context containing the answer. The context with the title "Oranjegekte" provides specific details about the clothing worn in the Netherlands during Oranjegekte and Koningsdag, so it is the most likely to contain the answer. The context with the title "Koningsdag" provides information about the national holiday and its celebration, so it is also likely to contain the answer.

Based on these considerations, the rankings of the contexts are as follows:
1. "Oranjegekte"
2. "Koningsdag"
3. "Jounen Kwéyòl"
4. "Christmas in the Basque Country"
5. "Children's Day (Japan)"
6. "Queen's Day (disambiguation)"
7. "Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day"
8. "White Sunday"
9. "Garifuna Settlement Day"
10. "The Eighth (United States)"

idx: [0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the color of clothing worn during Oranjegekte or Koningsdag in the Netherlands. 1. "Oranjegekte" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the claim and describes the orange clothing worn during Oranjegekte and Koningsdag, making it the most likely to contain the answer. 2. "Koningsdag" context: This context is relevant because it pertains to King's Day, which is part of the claim. However, it does not specifically mention the color of clothing, making it slightly less relevant than the Oranjegekte context. 3. "Queen's Day (disambiguation)" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses the holiday's former name and its connection to the current King's Day, but it does not detail the clothing color. 4. "Children's Day (Japan)" context: While this context is about a national holiday, it is not related to the Netherlands or the specific holidays mentioned in the claim, making it the least relevant of the top four. The other contexts are about holidays in different countries and are not relevant to the claim about Dutch national holidays and clothing color.
idx: [0, 4, 5, 3]

step-by-step think:1. "Oranjegekte" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the claim by mentioning the wearing of orange clothing during Oranjegekte and Koningsdag, which are the specific events in question. It is informative and very likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Koningsdag" context: While this context is relevant because it pertains to King's Day, it does not specifically mention the wearing of orange clothing, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the "Oranjegekte" context. 3. "Queen's Day (disambiguation)" context: This context provides historical information about the holiday's name change but does not address the current practices or the wearing of orange clothing, making it less relevant to the claim. 4. "Children's Day (Japan)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a completely different holiday in Japan and does not provide information about Dutch clothing practices during Oranjegekte or Koningsdag.

Context 5 directly mentions John John Florence, who fits the description of the claim, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.

idx: [5, 2, 8, 0, 3, 4, 6, 1]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about the American professional Hawaiian surfer born on 18 October 1992 who won the Rip Curl Pro Portugal. 1. Context from 'John John Florence': This context is highly relevant as it mentions John John Florence, an American professional surfer born on the exact date mentioned in the claim.

Context from 'MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal': This context is directly related to the event mentioned in the claim and states that John John Florence was the defending champion in 2016, which aligns with the timeframe of the claim. 3. Context from 'MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal 2016': This context is relevant as it pertains to the event for the year mentioned in the claim, where John John Florence could have won. 4. Context from 'Supertubos': This context is relevant because it describes the location where the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal is held, which is pertinent to the claim but does not directly answer it.

step-by-step think: 1. The first context, "John John Florence", directly mentions the claim by stating that he won the Rip Curl Pro Portugal. It provides relevant and informative information about the professional surfer and his achievements. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. The second context, "MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal", directly mentions the claim by stating that John John Florence is the defending champion of the event in 2016. It provides relevant and informative information about the professional surfing competition and its history. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim.

4. The fourth context, "Supertubos", mentions the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal event and provides information about the beach where it is held. However, it does not directly relate to the claim or provide specific information about the winner of the event. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous two contexts.

"Spynie Palace" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Spynie Palace, where Columba de Dunbar died, and discusses its history and founding, which is directly related to the claim. 2. "Columba de Dunbar" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about Columba de Dunbar's death at Spynie Palace, which is closely related to the claim. 3. "Bishop Dunbar's Hospital" context: This context is informative and mentions a Dunbar, but it's about a different person and a hospital, not the palace in question. 4. "Patrick IV, Earl of March" context: This context talks about a historical figure related to the Dunbar family, which might provide background information but is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 5. "George I, Earl of March" context: Similar to the previous context, it provides historical information about the Dunbar family but is less directly related to the claim. 6. "George II, Earl of March" context: This context is about a member of the Dunbar family and mentions the end of their titles, which could be indirectly related to the claim. 7. "Earl of Dunbar" context: This context provides a broad overview of the Earldom of Dunbar, which includes the time period in question but is not specific to the palace or the claim. 8. "Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses the ancestry and titles of the Dunbar family, which is far removed from the specific claim about the palace's founding.
idx: [2, 7, 4, 1, 5, 6, 9, 8]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the founding of the palace where Columba de Dunbar died in 1435. 1. "Spynie Palace" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Spynie Palace, the location of Columba de Dunbar's death, and provides information about the founding of the palace, which dates back to the late 12th Century. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Columba de Dunbar" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Columba de Dunbar and his death at Spynie Palace. It provides a specific timeframe for his death, which is closely related to the claim. 3. "Earl of Dunbar" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the title Earl of Dunbar and its connection to the area around Spynie Palace until 1435, the year of Columba de Dunbar's death. It may contain useful background information related to the claim. 4. "Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it talks about the Earl of Northumbria and the Earldom of Dunbar, which lasted until 1435. It provides historical context that could be related to the claim. The other contexts are less relevant as they either pertain to different individuals or are related to events that occurred after the founding of the palace and the death of Columba de Dunbar.
idx: [2, 7, 9, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Spynie Palace" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the founding of Spynie Palace, which is the specific location in question. It provides a clear time frame for the founding of the palace, dating back to the late 12th Century, which is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Columba de Dunbar" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions Columba de Dunbar's death at Spynie Palace and provides a time frame for his tenure as Bishop of Moray, which overlaps with the founding period of the palace. However, it does not provide a specific founding date, making it slightly less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim compared to the first context. 3. "Earl of Dunbar" context: While this context mentions the title Earl of Dunbar and a historical figure associated with the Dunbar name, it does not provide information about Spynie Palace or its founding. It is less relevant to the claim. 4. "Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria" context: This context discusses the lineage of the Earls of Dunbar and mentions the year 1435, but it does not provide information about Spynie Palace or its founding, making it the least relevant to the claim.

It is likely to contain useful information for understanding the claim. 3. "San Luis Obispo, California" context: This context is relevant as it provides information about the city where Bubblegum Alley is located. It may not directly answer the claim but offers useful background information. 4. "Ouch! (gum)" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it discusses bubble gum, which is related to the topic of Bubblegum Alley. However, it does not provide the location of the alley. 5. "Digital Media Factory" context: This context is slightly relevant due to the mention of a location in California and a connection to gum (former Wrigley Gum manufacturing facility), but it does not address the claim directly. 6. "Hollywood Star Lanes" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a bowling alley in Los Angeles, California, with no direct connection to Bubblegum Alley. 7. "Up Your Alley Fair" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a fair in San Francisco, California, with no direct connection to Bubblegum Alley. 8. "Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a baseball wall of fame in Philadelphia, with no connection to Bubblegum Alley. 9.

"Old US 67 Rest Area" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a rest area in Arkansas, with no connection to Bubblegum Alley.
idx: [9, 5, 7, 1, 8, 0, 2, 3]

step-by-step think:1. "Bubblegum Alley" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly addresses the claim by describing Bubblegum Alley's location in San Luis Obispo, California, and provides specific details about the alley itself. 2. "San Luis Obispo, California" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about the city where Bubblegum Alley is located, which is useful for understanding the broader location of the attraction. 3. "Gum Wall" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions Bubblegum Alley in comparison to Gum Wall, providing context and highlighting the similarity between the two attractions. 4. "Digital Media Factory" context: This context is less relevant but is included because it mentions a location in California and a connection to gum manufacturing, which could be tangentially related to the claim about Bubblegum Alley.
idx: [9, 7, 5, 8]

"Bubblegum Alley" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the claim by mentioning Bubblegum Alley and providing specific details about its location in downtown San Luis Obispo, California. It is informative and almost certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "San Luis Obispo, California" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about the city where Bubblegum Alley is located. It adds context to the location mentioned in the claim, making it likely to contain supplementary information to the answer. 3.

Question:At what venue was the January 2, 2012 game featured the University of Louisville team?
golden idx: [1, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the venue of the January 2, 2012 game featuring the University of Louisville team. 1. "2012 Louisville Cardinals football team" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions the University of Louisville's 2012 football season and their games, making it highly likely to contain the answer. 2. "2013 Sugar Bowl" context: This context is relevant because it mentions a game involving the Louisville Cardinals close to the date in question, although it's a year later. It may not contain the exact answer but is informative about the team's activities around that time. 3. "Parkway Field" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the University of Louisville's use of Parkway Field, which could potentially be the venue in question. 4. "2008 Fiesta Bowl" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions a game from a different year, but it's still about college football bowl games and could provide insight into typical venues. 5. "1989 Fiesta Bowl" context: Similar to the 2008 Fiesta Bowl context, this one is less relevant due to the different year but is related to college football bowl games. 6. "1989 Cotton Bowl Classic" context: This context is about a college football bowl game played on the same date but in a different year, making it somewhat relevant. 7. "1943 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament" context: This context is not directly relevant as it is about basketball and from a much earlier time, but it mentions a venue that could potentially be used for other sports. 8. "1956 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament" context: Similar to the 1943 context, this one is also about basketball and from a different era, making it the least relevant of the contexts that are still about sports.
idx: [9, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 0, 2]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the venue of the January 2, 2012 game featuring the University of Louisville team. 1. Context 9: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the 2012 Louisville Cardinals football team and mentions Papa John's Cardinal Stadium as their home venue. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context 1: This context is about the 2013 Sugar Bowl, which took place on January 2, 2013, and involved the Louisville Cardinals. It is informative and provides the venue of the Sugar Bowl game, which is relevant to the claim. 3. Context 7: This context talks about Parkway Field, a venue associated with the University of Louisville team, but it states that they moved to Cardinal Stadium in 1998, making it less likely to be the answer to the claim. 4. Context 3: This context is about the 2008 Fiesta Bowl, which is not directly related to the claim but provides information about a bowl game that could be confused with the Sugar Bowl. It is less relevant than the contexts that mention the Louisville Cardinals or their venues directly.
idx: [9, 1, 7, 3]

step-by-step think: 
1. "2012 Louisville Cardinals football team" context: It directly relates to the claim as it mentions the University of Louisville team in 2012. It provides information about the team's season, head coach, home games venue, and their invitation to the Sugar Bowl where they defeated Florida. It is highly relevant, informative, and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. "2013 Sugar Bowl" context: This context directly mentions the January 2, 2012 game featuring the University of Louisville team, which is part of the claim. It provides detailed information about the Sugar Bowl, the teams involved (Louisville and Florida), and the broadcast information. It is relevant, informative, and highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. "Parkway Field" context: Although it mentions the University of Louisville team and provides information about the park they played at, it is not directly related to the claim about the January 2, 2012 game. It is less relevant and less likely to contain the answer compared to the two contexts above.
4. "2008 Fiesta Bowl" context: This context refers to a different game (2008 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl) involving the University of Louisville team. It is not directly related to the claim about the January 2, 2012 game. It is informative about a different game but not likely to contain the answer to the claim.
Based on the above reasoning, the top 2 ranked contexts are "2012 Louisville Cardinals football team" (index 9) and "2013 Sugar Bowl" (index 1).

Question:Which film was Oscar nominated, LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton or Gimme Shelter, the 1970 Rolling Stones documentary?
golden idx: [2, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim asks which film was Oscar-nominated between "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" and "Gimme Shelter," the 1970 Rolling Stones documentary. To rank the contexts, I will prioritize those that mention either of the films and their association with the Oscars. 1. Context 2 directly states that "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 74th Academy Awards, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context 9 mentions "Gimme Shelter" as a documentary film but does not mention an Oscar nomination, making it relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. Context 1 mentions the "Gimme Shelter" film in relation to audio samples used in an album, which is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer. 4. Context 4 mentions a cameraman associated with "Gimme Shelter," which is relevant but not directly answering the claim. 5. Context 0 talks about an album that features samples from "Gimme Shelter," which is tangentially relevant. 6. Context 3, 5, 6, and 7 mention "Gimme Shelter" in various capacities but do not provide information about the Oscar nomination, making them less relevant. 7. Context 8 is the least relevant as it only disambiguates the term "Gimme Shelter."
idx: [2,9,1,4,0,3,5,6]

step-by-step think: 1. "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" context: It directly mentions the film in question that was Oscar nominated. It provides information about the film and its nomination at the Academy Awards. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 
2. "Gimme Shelter (1970 film)" context: This context directly mentions the Rolling Stones documentary "Gimme Shelter" but does not explicitly mention if it was Oscar nominated. It provides information about the film, its content, and its screening at the Cannes Film Festival. It is relevant and likely contains some information about the Rolling Stones documentary, but may have less relevance to the specific claim about Oscar nominations.
3. "Merry Clayton" context: Although it does not directly relate to the claim, it mentions Merry Clayton's involvement in the Rolling Stones song "Gimme Shelter" and her contribution to the Oscar-winning documentary "20 Feet from Stardom". It provides some information about the Rolling Stones documentary but may have less direct relevance to the claim about Oscar nominations.
4. "Baird Bryant" context: This context mentions Baird Bryant's involvement as the cameraman on the Rolling Stones documentary "Gimme Shelter" but does not provide direct information about its Oscar nomination. It provides information about the Altamont Free Concert and the fatal stabbing captured in the documentary. It may have less direct relevance to the claim about Oscar nominations.
5. Considering the relevance, direct mention of Oscar nomination, and likelihood of containing the answer, "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" is the highest scoring context.  
6. Considering the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer, "Gimme Shelter (1970 film)" is the second highest scoring context. 
7. Considering the indirect mention of the Rolling Stones documentary and the Oscar-winning documentary "20 Feet from Stardom", "Merry Clayton" is the third highest scoring context. 
8. Considering the indirect mention of the Rolling Stones documentary and its cameraman, "Baird Bryant" is the fourth highest scoring context.
idx: [2, 9, 1, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly confirms the film was nominated for an Oscar, answering the claim. 2. "Gimme Shelter (1970 film)" context: While this context provides detailed information about the film, it does not mention an Oscar nomination, making it less relevant to the claim than the first context. 3. "Merry Clayton" context: This context mentions the song "Gimme Shelter" and an Oscar-winning documentary, but it does not provide information about the film's Oscar nomination status, making it less relevant. 4. "Baird Bryant" context: This context is related to the film "Gimme Shelter" but focuses on a specific event filmed by the cameraman, not on the Oscar nomination status, thus it is the least relevant to the claim.

idx: [2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: To determine which board game was published most recently, Pirate's Cove or Catan, I will rank the contexts based on their publication dates and relevance to the claim.
1. "The Rivals for Catan" context (idx: 6): This context is highly relevant as it mentions the publication date of "The Rivals for Catan" as 2010, which is a part of the "Catan" series of games.

4. "Catan: Seafarers" context (idx: 8): This context is relevant as it discusses an expansion of "The Settlers of Catan", but the publication date is not mentioned, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts with explicit publication dates.
5. "Catan" context (idx: 3): This context is informative as it provides the original publication date of "The Settlers of Catan" as 1995, but it is less relevant to the claim about the most recently published game.

8. "Struggle for Rome (board game)" context (idx: 7): This context is the least relevant as it discusses a game based on "Settlers of Catan" mechanics but does not provide a publication date and is less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

idx: [6, 5, 2, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Pirate's Cove" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the publication year of "Pirate's Cove" which is directly related to the claim. It states that the game was originally published in 2002 and republished in 2003, which is essential information for determining the most recently published game. 2. "The Rivals for Catan" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions the release year of "The Rivals for Catan", which is 2010. This information is necessary to compare the publication dates of the two games in question. The other contexts, while related to the "Catan" series, do not provide direct information about the publication dates of the main games in question and are therefore not as relevant for this specific claim.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about which Eminem album included vocals from the singer of "Unapologetic". Context 2, "The Monster (song)", is the most relevant as it directly mentions the collaboration between Eminem and Rihanna, who released "Unapologetic". Context 4, "Numb (Rihanna song)", is also highly relevant because it mentions a song from "Unapologetic" featuring Eminem.

Question:This American crime film set in South Los Angeles was written and directed by the same director and writer of screenwriter of "Street Kings", "End of Watch", "Sabotage", "Fury" and what other film? 
golden idx: [6, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for a film written and directed by David Ayer, who is known for "Street Kings", "End of Watch", "Sabotage", "Fury", and another film. The context must relate to David Ayer's work, specifically his role as a writer and director, and the setting of South Los Angeles.

1. Context 8 is the most relevant because it directly mentions David Ayer and lists the films he is known for, including "Training Day", "Harsh Times", "Street Kings", "End of Watch", "Sabotage", "Fury", and "Suicide Squad". This context is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 6 is the second most relevant as it discusses "Harsh Times", a film set in South Los Angeles written and directed by David Ayer. This context is informative and directly related to the claim.
3. Context 9 is relevant because it talks about "End of Watch", another film by David Ayer set in South Los Angeles. It is likely to contain information related to the claim.
4. Context 1 mentions "Street Kings 2: Motor City", a sequel to "Street Kings", which is one of Ayer's films. However, it does not mention Ayer directly, so it is less relevant than contexts that do.
5. Context 0 mentions a crime film set in South Los Angeles but does not relate to David Ayer or the films listed in the claim.
6. Context 3 discusses Central Avenue in Los Angeles, which could be relevant to the setting of Ayer's films but does not directly address the claim.

8. Context 2 mentions Bonsallo Avenue, a location in South Los Angeles, which has a thematic connection to Ayer's films but is not directly related to the claim.

1. Context with index 0: This context is about a rock band called Lostprophets, which is mentioned in the claim.

4. The context with index 3, titled "Always (Saliva song)", is indirectly related to the claim as it mentions a song by Saliva featuring Josey Scott. Although it does not provide information about the incarceration of any specific member, it gives information about the band's successful hit.

"Josey Scott" context: This context is relevant to the claim as it mentions Josey Scott and his career with the rock band Saliva. However, it does not provide information about any incarceration, thus it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Always (Saliva song)" context: This context is related to Josey Scott's work with Saliva but is not directly relevant to the claim about incarceration. It provides information about a specific song and its success, which is less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:The movies Queen of Blood and Battle Beyond the Sun both contained scenes from what 1959 Soviet feature?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: Though the movie, "Battle Beyond the Sun", seems similar to the claim, it is about a Soviet science fiction film directed by Mikhail Karyukov and Aleksandr Kozyr in 1959. It tells of the "space race" of two future nations competing to become the first to land a spacecraft on the planet Mars. It does not provide any relevant information about the movies "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun". Thus, it is not likely to contain the answer to the claim. The context "Battle Beyond the Stars" is about an American space opera film from 1980, which is not directly related to the claim. The context "All Costs Paid" is about a Soviet TV miniseries produced by Studio Ekran. It includes information about the war in Afghanistan but does not mention the movies "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun" at all. The context "Girl Seeks Father" is about a Soviet drama film from 1959, which is not directly related to the claim about movies "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun". The context "Tracker (1987 film)" is about a Soviet drama film from 1987, which is not directly related to the claim. The context "I Was a Satellite of the Sun" is a Soviet feature dramatic science-fiction film of 1959 with animation elements, which is not directly related to the claim. The context "The Key (1961 film)" is a Soviet feature animated film from 1961, which is not directly related to the claim. The context "The Scarlet Flower (1952 film)" is a Soviet feature animated film from 1952, which is not directly related to the claim. 

idx: [6, 1, 2, 4, 0, 3, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 6: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Queen of Blood" and states that it reused special effects footage from the Soviet features "Mechte Navstrechu" and "Nebo Zovyot". Since the question asks about scenes from a 1959 Soviet feature, the mention of "Nebo Zovyot" makes this context likely to contain the answer. 2. Context idx 3: This context is also relevant because it mentions "Battle Beyond the Sun" and its original Soviet version "Nebo Zovyot", directly linking to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer since "Nebo Zovyot" is a 1959 Soviet film. 3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a 1959 Soviet drama film, which makes it somewhat relevant, but it does not mention the reuse of scenes, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. Context idx 7: This context mentions another 1959 Soviet film, which could potentially be relevant, but it lacks direct connection to the films mentioned in the claim, making it less likely to contain the answer.
idx: [6, 3, 4, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Queen of Blood" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that "Queen of Blood" reused special effects footage from the Soviet features "Mechte Navstrechu" and "Nebo Zovyot". Since the claim asks about scenes from a 1959 Soviet feature, and "Nebo Zovyot" is a 1959 Soviet film, this context is likely to contain the answer. 2. "Battle Beyond the Sun" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions "Nebo Zovyot", the 1959 Soviet science fiction film. It is likely to contain the answer since "Battle Beyond the Sun" is the re-edited version of "Nebo Zovyot". 3. "Girl Seeks Father" context: This context is about a different 1959 Soviet film and does not mention reuse of scenes, making it less relevant to the claim. 4. "I Was a Satellite of the Sun" context: Although this is a 1959 Soviet film, there is no mention of scene reuse, so it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

"Erika Jayne" context: This context provides the birth date of Erika Jayne as 10 July 1971, which is directly relevant to the claim. 2. "Marco Da Silva (dancer)" context: This context provides the birth date of Marco Da Silva as 30 May 1977, which is also directly relevant to the claim.

The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not provide information about the birth dates of the individuals in question or are about different individuals with similar names. Therefore, they are ranked lower.

Question:Who is Bruce Spizer an expert on, known as the most influential act of the rock era?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for the expertise of Bruce Spizer, specifically on the most influential act of the rock era. Context 6 directly mentions Bruce Spizer and identifies him as an expert on The Beatles, which is also described as the most influential act of the rock era in contexts 2 and 3. Therefore, context 6 is the most relevant and informative. Contexts 2 and 3 are also highly relevant as they confirm The Beatles' status as the most influential act of the rock era. Context 3 provides a more detailed account of The Beatles' influence and is slightly more informative than context 2, so it ranks higher. Context 9 mentions Bruce Spizer as a Beatles historian and author, which is directly relevant to the claim. Context 0 mentions Elvis Presley as the "#1 act of the Rock era" according to a "Billboard" historian, which could be seen as competing information to the claim, so it is relevant but less so than the contexts that mention The Beatles. Contexts 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are about other rock bands or entities and do not mention Bruce Spizer or The Beatles, making them less relevant to the claim.
idx: [6, 3, 2, 9, 0, 1, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about Bruce Spizer's expertise and their likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context 6: This context is directly about Bruce Spizer and states his expertise on The Beatles, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 2. Context 3: This context provides detailed information about The Beatles, the act Bruce Spizer is an expert on, making it relevant and likely to contain supporting details. 3. Context 2: Similar to context 3, this context discusses The Beatles' cultural impact, which is relevant to the claim and may provide additional insights. 4. Context 9: This context mentions Bruce Spizer as a Beatles historian and author, which is relevant but less direct than the previous contexts. The remaining contexts are about other topics and are less relevant to the claim.
idx: [6, 3, 2, 9]

step-by-step think:1. "Bruce Spizer" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Bruce Spizer and establishes him as an expert on The Beatles. It provides specific information about his role as a tax attorney and his recognition as an authority on The Beatles, including his publications on the band. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "The Beatles" context: This context is also highly relevant because it describes The Beatles as the most influential act of the rock era, which is the exact phrase used in the claim. It provides detailed information about the band's formation, members, and their impact on music and culture. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Cultural impact of the Beatles" context: While this context is relevant and informative about The Beatles' cultural impact, it is slightly less directly related to the claim compared to the first two contexts. It does not mention Bruce Spizer or his expertise. 4. "Marsha Albert" context: This context is the least relevant to the claim. Although it mentions Bruce Spizer as a Beatles historian and author, it focuses more on Marsha Albert's role in Beatlemania and does not provide direct information about Spizer's expertise on The Beatles.

step-by-step think: The claim is about a Celtic ruler born in AD 43 who ruled southeastern Britain prior to its conquest. The most relevant context would be one that discusses the Celtic tribes of southeastern Britain and the Roman conquest since the question asks about the empire that conquered the region. 1. "Catuvellauni" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Catuvellauni, a Celtic tribe from southeastern Britain, which is directly related to the claim. 2. "Roman conquest of Britain" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses the Roman conquest of Britain, which began in AD 43, the same year mentioned in the claim. 3. "Togodumnus" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a historical king of the British Catuvellauni tribe at the time of the Roman conquest. 4. "Romano-British culture" context: This context is informative as it discusses the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire after the conquest in AD 43. 5.

idx: [5, 6, 3, 0, 2, 4, 7, 9]

step-by-step think:1. "Roman conquest of Britain" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the Roman conquest of Britain beginning in AD 43, which directly answers the claim regarding the empire that conquered southeastern Britain. 2. "Togodumnus" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Togodumnus, a king of the Catuvellauni tribe during the Roman conquest, which is directly related to the claim about a Celtic ruler. 3. "Catuvellauni" context: This context is relevant as it talks about the Celtic tribe of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, which is the region and time period in question. 4. "Romano-British culture" context: This context is informative as it describes the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire after the conquest in AD 43, providing background information that is relevant to the claim.

step-by-step think: 1. "Roman conquest of Britain" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the Roman conquest of Britain starting in AD 43, which aligns with the time of the Celtic ruler's rule mentioned in the claim.

It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3.

Question:Which songwriting duo composed music for "La La Land", and created lyrics for "A Christmas Story: The Musical"? 
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: 
First, let's identify the relevant contexts based on the claim: 
1. The claim mentions "La La Land" and "A Christmas Story: The Musical". We can see that context 2 mentions "La La Land" and context 6 mentions "A Christmas Story: The Musical". 

Now, let's consider the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer for each context: 

Context 2 ("David and Sandy Reynolds-Wasco"): 
- Relevance: This context is about David and Sandy Reynolds-Wasco, who are production designers and art directors. They have worked on "La La Land" and received awards for their work on the film. It is directly related to the claim. 
- Informativeness: This context provides information about the work of David and Sandy Reynolds-Wasco on "La La Land" and their collaborations with director Quentin Tarantino. 
- Likelihood of containing the answer: Since the context specifically mentions "La La Land" and their work on the film, it is likely to contain relevant information about the music composition and lyrics. 

Context 6 ("A Christmas Story: The Musical"): 
- Relevance: This context is about "A Christmas Story: The Musical", one of the films mentioned in the claim. It is directly related to the claim. 
- Informativeness: This context provides information about the musical version of "A Christmas Story", including the music and lyrics written by Pasek & Paul. 
- Likelihood of containing the answer: Since the context specifically mentions Pasek & Paul as the composers and lyricists, it is likely to contain relevant information about their work in composing music and creating lyrics. 

Based on the above analysis, context 2 and context 6 are the most relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 

idx: [1, 6]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the songwriting duo who composed music for "La La Land" and also created lyrics for "A Christmas Story: The Musical". 

1. "La La Land (soundtrack)" is relevant as it specifically mentions the soundtrack album of the film "La La Land". However, it does not provide any information about the songwriting duo responsible for the music and lyrics.

2. "David and Sandy Reynolds-Wasco" mention the duo's name, but they are production designers and art directors, not songwriters.

3. "Audition (The Fools Who Dream)" mentions Justin Hurwitz as the composer, but it does not mention the songwriting duo.

4. "La La Land (Demi Lovato song)" is not relevant as it is about a different song with the same name, and it does not mention the songwriting duo.

5. "Pasek and Paul" specifically mentions that they are a songwriting duo and have worked on the film "La La Land", as well as other musical theater, films, and television projects. They are likely the duo responsible for the music and lyrics for both "La La Land" and "A Christmas Story: The Musical". This context is highly relevant, informative, and likely contains the answer to the claim.

6. "Another Day of Sun" mentions Justin Hurwitz and Benj Pasek and Justin Paul as the composer and lyricists, respectively. However, it does not mention their role in "A Christmas Story: The Musical".

7. "A Christmas Story: The Musical" mentions Pasek & Paul as the writers of music and lyrics for the musical version of the film. This context directly relates to the claim and is highly relevant, informative, and likely contains the answer.

8. "Mary Zophres" is not relevant as it is about a costume designer for the film "La La Land".

9. "City of Stars" mentions Justin Hurwitz as the composer and Benj Pasek and Justin Paul as the lyricists. However, it does not mention their role in "A Christmas Story: The Musical".

10. "List of accolades received by La La Land" is not relevant as it is about the film "La La Land" and its awards, not about the songwriting duo.

Based on the above analysis, the ranking of the contexts is as follows:
idx: [5, 7, 2, 8, 6, 1, 3, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. "Another Day of Sun" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the song from "La La Land" and specifically names Justin Hurwitz, Benj Pasek, and Justin Paul, directly answering the claim about the songwriting duo. 2. "City of Stars" context: Similar to the first context, this one is also highly relevant because it mentions another song from "La La Land" and credits the same individuals for the music and lyrics, reinforcing the answer to the claim. 3. "Audition (The Fools Who Dream)" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the song from "La La Land" and the individuals involved, but it is slightly less informative regarding the broader work of the duo outside of this specific film. 4. "Mary Zophres" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on the costume designer for "La La Land" and does not mention the songwriting duo or their work on "A Christmas Story: The Musical".

step-by-step think:"German language" context: This context directly mentions the Western Germanic language and provides information about the languages similar to German. It is relevant and likely contains information about the language spoken from which the small settlement derives its name.

"Old Saxon" context: This context mentions a West Germanic language closely related to the Anglo-Frisian languages. While it does not directly mention the Western Germanic language spoken from which the small settlement derives its name, it provides relevant information about the language family.

"Proto-Norse language" context: This context mentions a characteristically North Germanic language spoken in Scandinavia. While it does not directly mention the Western Germanic language spoken from which the small settlement derives its name, it provides relevant information about the historical language evolution in the region.

"Dutch language" context: This context mentions a West Germanic language spoken by around 24 million people. While it does not directly mention the Western Germanic language spoken from which the small settlement derives its name, it provides relevant information about another Germanic language.

"Suorva" context: This context mentions a small settlement situated on the river Leda, but it does not provide direct information about the language spoken from which the settlement derives its name.

"English language" context: This context mentions a West Germanic language spoken in early medieval England. While it does not directly mention the Western Germanic language spoken from which the small settlement derives its name, it provides relevant information about another Germanic language.

idx: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the Western Germanic language from which the settlement on the river Leda opposite Leer derives its name. 1. "Old Saxon" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses Old Saxon, a West Germanic language spoken in the region of Saxony, which is likely the language in question. It provides a time frame from the 8th to the 12th century, which is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Leda (river)" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the Leda river and the settlement of Kloster Muhde, which is derived from the Old Frisian word for "(river) mouth". It connects the geographical location with the language, making it likely to contain the answer. 3. "Leer" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the town of Leer, situated on the river Leda. It provides geographical context but does not directly address the language aspect. 4. "German language" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses the German language and its relation to other West Germanic languages. It may provide background information but is less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. 5. "Dutch language" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses the Dutch language, which is a West Germanic language but not the one likely referred to in the claim. It is informative but less likely to contain the answer. 6. "English language" context: This context is informative about the English language and its origins but is not directly relevant to the claim about the Western Germanic language spoken near Leer. 7. "Proto-Norse language" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a North Germanic language, which is different from the West Germanic language family in question. 8. "Suorva" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a settlement in Sweden, which is unrelated to the Western Germanic language or the settlement near Leer.
idx: [2,5,7,0]

step-by-step think:1. "Old Saxon" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the Old Saxon language, which is a West Germanic language and likely the language from which the settlement on the river Leda opposite Leer derives its name. It provides a detailed history of the language and its evolution, making it informative and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Leda (river)" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the river Leda and the settlement of Kloster Muhde, which is situated on the river Leda opposite Leer. The paragraph also provides the etymology of "Muhde," linking it to Old Frisian, which is related to the West Germanic languages. It is less directly related to the language aspect of the claim but still likely to contain useful information. 3. "Leer" context: This context provides information about the town of Leer, which is related to the geographical aspect of the claim but does not directly address the language or the settlement's name. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts. 4. "German language" context: While this context discusses the German language, which is a West Germanic language, it does not specifically address the Old Saxon language or the historical period in question. It is informative but less relevant to the claim's specific focus on the Western Germanic language spoken in the past.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "William Bonfield" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions William Bonfield being born on 6 March 1937 and identifies him as a British citizen, directly addressing the claim. 2. "Alistair Grant" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions Alistair Grant's birth date as 6 March 1937 and identifies him as a British businessman, which is likely to answer the claim. 3. "British people" context: This context provides information about British citizenship and nationality, which is relevant to the claim about being a citizen of the United Kingdom. 4. "Robin Bailie" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Robin Bailie being born on 6 March 1937 and being a Northern Irish solicitor and former politician, indicating a connection to the UK. 5. "Paul Méfano" context: While this context mentions the birth date, it identifies Paul Méfano as a French composer, which is less directly relevant to the claim about UK citizenship. 6. "Valentina Tereshkova" context: This context is informative but not relevant to the claim as it discusses a Russian cosmonaut. 7. "Chawalit Kamutchati" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a Thai sports shooter with no direct link to the UK. 8. "Arild Nyquist" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a Norwegian novelist with no mention of UK citizenship. 9. "Vatroslav Rožić" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a Croatian linguist. 10. "Australian referendum, 1937" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses an event in Australia with no mention of individuals or UK citizenship.
idx: [0, 3, 1, 9, 6, 5, 7, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "William Bonfield" context: This context directly mentions a person named "William Bonfield" who was born on 6 March 1937. It is relevant to the claim and likely contains information about the claim. 
2. "British people" context: This context provides information about British people and their citizenship in the United Kingdom. It indirectly relates to the claim by mentioning the United Kingdom. It is informative and might contain relevant information about the claim.
3. "Alistair Grant" context: This context mentions a person named "Alistair Grant" who was born on 6 March 1937. It is relevant to the claim but might not be as likely to contain information about the claim compared to other contexts.
4. "Robin Bailie" context: This context mentions a person named "Robin Bailie" who was born on 6 March 1937. It is relevant to the claim but might not be as likely to contain information about the claim compared to other contexts.

idx: [0, 1, 3, 9]

step-by-step think:1. "William Bonfield" context: It directly mentions the claim in the first sentence, stating that William Bonfield was born on 6 March 1937 and is a citizen of the United Kingdom. This context is highly relevant to the claim and likely contains the answer. Additionally, it provides specific information about William Bonfield's occupation, which adds to its informativeness.
2. "British people" context: This context provides general information about British people and British citizenship. While it indirectly relates to the claim by mentioning the citizenship of the United Kingdom, it is less specific and may not directly contain the answer.
3. "Alistair Grant" context: This context mentions that Alistair Grant was born on 6 March 1937 but does not mention his citizenship. Although it is somewhat relevant to the claim, it lacks the specific information needed to answer the claim.
4. "Robin Bailie" context: This context mentions that Robin Bailie was born on 6 March 1937 but does not mention his citizenship. Similar to the previous context, it is somewhat relevant but lacks the specific information required to address the claim.

Based on the above assessment, the two highest scoring contexts are "William Bonfield" and "British people" in terms of their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

Question:What country does Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle, Angus have in common?
golden idx: [6, 9]
step-by-step think: To answer the question about the common country for Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle, Angus, I will prioritize contexts that mention both locations and provide geographical information. 1. "Hatton Castle, Angus" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both Hatton Castle and Hatton Hill, providing specific details about their location in Angus, Scotland. It is the most likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Hatton Hill" context: This context is also highly relevant because it specifically mentions Hatton Hill and its location in Angus, Scotland. It complements the information provided in the "Hatton Castle, Angus" context. 3. "Hatton Castle, Aberdeenshire" context: While this context mentions Hatton Castle, it refers to a different location in Aberdeenshire, which is not directly relevant to the claim. However, it may still contain useful geographical information. 4. "Auchterhouse Castle" context: This context is relevant as it provides information about a location in Angus, Scotland, which is the same region as Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle. 5. "Broughty Castle" context: Similar to the "Auchterhouse Castle" context, this one is relevant due to its geographical information about a location in Dundee, Angus, Scotland. 6. "Hutton Castle" context: This context is less relevant because it refers to a different castle and location, but the name similarity could potentially cause confusion. 7. "Angus cattle" context: This context is informative about Angus cattle, which shares the name with the region of interest, but it is not directly related to the claim. 8. "Hatton, Warwickshire" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a location in Warwickshire, England, which is not related to the claim about a common country for Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle, Angus.
idx: [6,9,2,0,1,4,7,5]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the common country between Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle, Angus. 1. "Hatton Castle, Angus" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle, providing information about their location in Angus, Scotland. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Hatton Hill" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Hatton Hill and its location in Angus, Scotland, and its relation to Hatton Castle. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Hatton Castle, Aberdeenshire" context: This context is less relevant because it refers to a different Hatton Castle located in Aberdeenshire, not Angus. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim about Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle, Angus. 4. "Auchterhouse Castle" context: This context is informative about another castle in Angus, Scotland, but it does not mention Hatton Hill or Hatton Castle, Angus. It is less relevant to the claim. 5. "Broughty Castle" context: Similar to the Auchterhouse Castle context, this one is about a different castle in Angus and does not mention Hatton Hill or Hatton Castle, Angus. It is less relevant to the claim. 6. "Hutton Castle" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a castle in a different region (Scottish Borders) and does not mention Hatton Hill or Hatton Castle, Angus. 7. "Angus cattle" context: This context is about Angus cattle and does not relate to the claim about Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle, Angus. 8. "Hatton, Warwickshire" context: This context is about a location in Warwickshire, England, and is not relevant to the claim about Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle, Angus in Scotland.
idx: [6, 9, 2, 0]

step-by-step think: 
1. "Hatton Castle, Angus" context: This context directly mentions "Hatton Castle" and "Hatton Hill," which are part of the claim. It provides detailed information about the castle's location, design, and history. It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. "Hatton Hill" context: This context directly mentions "Hatton Hill" and provides information about its location and its connection to Hatton Castle. Although it is not as detailed as the previous context, it is still relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. "Hatton Castle, Aberdeenshire" context: This context mentions "Hatton Castle," but it is located in a different region (Aberdeenshire) compared to the claim (Angus). It provides detailed information about this castle's location, designation, and gardens. Although informative, it is less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous two contexts.
4. "Auchterhouse Castle" context: This context mentions another castle, "Auchterhouse Castle," but it is located northwest of Dundee, which is not directly related to the claim about Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle. Although it provides historical information, it is less likely to contain the answer compared to the previous contexts.

Question:What podcast was the cheif executive officer of Nerdist Industries a guest on?
golden idx: [2, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking about a podcast that the chief executive officer of Nerdist Industries was a guest on. The most relevant context would be the one that directly mentions Chris Hardwick, who is the CEO of Nerdist Industries. The context that directly mentions Chris Hardwick as the CEO of Nerdist Industries and his guest appearance on a podcast would likely contain the answer to the claim. Therefore, the first ranked context should be the one that directly mentions Chris Hardwick's guest appearance on a podcast. The second ranked context could be the one that provides more information about the Nerdist Podcast, which is the flagship podcast for Nerdist Industries. This context supports the relevance of Chris Hardwick's guest appearance on a podcast. The third ranked context could provide general information about the Nerdist Industries. Even though it doesn't directly mention Chris Hardwick's guest appearance, it provides context and background information about the company. The fourth and fifth ranked contexts are not directly related to the claim since they talk about other topics such as movies, on-camera hosts, and web series. Therefore, they are less likely to contain the answer. The sixth and seventh ranked contexts provide detailed information about the board roles and executive positions that Chris Hardwick served in. Although they are informative, they don't directly answer the claim. The eighth ranked context provides information about the Nerdist Industries. Even though it mentions Jessica Chobot as the host of Nerdist News, it is not as directly relevant as the first two ranked contexts. 
idx: [0, 1, 9, 4, 3, 5, 6, 2]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about the podcast where the CEO of Nerdist Industries was a guest. 1. "The Drop-In (podcast)" context: This context is highly relevant as it explicitly mentions Chris Hardwick, CEO at Nerdist Industries, as a guest on the podcast. It is informative and directly answers the claim. 2. "The Nerdist Podcast" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the flagship podcast of Nerdist Industries, hosted by Chris Hardwick. However, it does not mention him being a guest on another podcast. 3. "Nerdist Industries" context: This context provides background information about Nerdist Industries and its podcasts, which is relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. 4. "Comedy Film Nerds" context: This context mentions Chris Hardwick as a guest, making it relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 5. "Maltin on Movies" context: This context is related to Nerdist Industries but does not mention Chris Hardwick as a guest. 6. "Nerdist News" context: While this context is about a Nerdist-branded newsletter, it does not address the claim about Chris Hardwick being a guest on a podcast. 7. "Jessica Chobot" context: This context mentions Jessica Chobot's involvement with Nerdist Industries but does not relate to the claim about Chris Hardwick. 8. "Bobby Mehta" context: This context is entirely irrelevant to the claim as it discusses a different individual with no connection to Nerdist Industries or podcasts.
idx: [0, 1, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "The Drop-In (podcast)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Chris Hardwick, CEO at Nerdist Industries, as a guest on the podcast. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "The Nerdist Podcast" context: Although this context is about the Nerdist Podcast, which is related to Nerdist Industries, it does not mention Chris Hardwick being a guest on another podcast, making it less relevant to the specific claim. 3. "Comedy Film Nerds" context: This context mentions Chris Hardwick as a guest, which makes it relevant. However, it does not specify his role as CEO of Nerdist Industries, so it might be less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first context. 4. "Jessica Chobot" context: This context is informative about Jessica Chobot's involvement with Nerdist Industries but does not mention Chris Hardwick or his guest appearances on podcasts, making it the least relevant to the claim.

Context idx 0: This context mentions George Harrison and his work, which is relevant but less directly connected to the claim than the contexts that discuss the specific songs mentioned. 4. Context idx 9: This context is about Syd Barrett, another English musician, and while it is informative, it is not directly relevant to the claim about George Harrison's songs.
idx: [4, 2, 0, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the English musician known for the songs "See Yourself" and "Within You Without You". Context index 4 is highly relevant as it provides detailed information about the song "Within You Without You" and its composer George Harrison.

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the year a series aired on CBS, starring an actor known for "Rebel Without a Cause." The most relevant context will be the one that mentions a CBS series and an actor from "Rebel Without a Cause."

Context 9 mentions Sal Mineo, another actor from "Rebel Without a Cause," but does not link him to a CBS series. Contexts 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 are less relevant because they do not mention a CBS series connected to an actor from "Rebel Without a Cause."

step-by-step think:1. "CBS Television Workshop" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the CBS series and includes James Dean, who is known for "Rebel Without a Cause."

However, it does not specify the series in question, so it ranks lower. 4. "Jack Grinnage" context: This context mentions an actor from "Rebel Without a Cause" and provides information about his television appearances, which could be relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention a series on CBS, so it's less likely to contain the answer.

step-by-step think:1.

8. Context idx 5 ("Avatar: The Last Airbender (season 3)"): This context is also about the prequel series and does not directly address the claim.
9. Context idx 7 ("Iroh"): This context is the least relevant as it discusses a character from the prequel series and does not provide information about the antagonist's introduction or role in "The Legend of Korra".
10. Context idx 9 ("Avatar: The Last Airbender (season 1)"): This context, like idx 7, is about the prequel series and not relevant to the claim.

Based on the above considerations, the top 8 ranked contexts are:
idx: [4, 3, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the season in which a character was introduced who becomes the main antagonist in the following season of "The Legend of Korra". 1. Context idx 4 ("Kuvira"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Kuvira being introduced in the third season and becoming the main antagonist in the fourth season. 2. Context idx 3 ("Zaheer"): This context is relevant because it discusses Zaheer, who is a main antagonist in the third season, but it does not answer the claim about the introduction of a character who becomes the main antagonist in the following season. 3. Context idx 8 ("The Legend of Korra"): This context provides an overview of the series but does not specifically address the claim about the antagonist's introduction. 4. Context idx 6 ("List of The Legend of Korra episodes"): This context provides general information about the series' episodes and seasons but lacks specific details about the introduction of the antagonist character.

It is informative and contains the exact answer to the claim. 2.

"The Legend of Korra" context: This context provides general information about the series but does not directly address the claim regarding the specific character's introduction and role as an antagonist. 4. "List of The Legend of Korra episodes" context: This context provides an overview of the series' episodes and seasons but does not specifically mention the character's introduction or role as an antagonist.

Question:Who were the directors of the 2009 American science fiction film starring the actor who played Dexter Morgan in the Showtime TV Network series "Dexter"?
golden idx: [5, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the context that directly mentions the 2009 American science fiction film and the actor Michael C. Hall. Context 5 is the most relevant as it names the film "Gamer" and identifies the directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. This context is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. Next, I will look for contexts that mention Michael C. Hall and his role in "Dexter," as these are related to the actor mentioned in the claim. Contexts 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 all mention Michael C. Hall or "Dexter" but do not provide information about the film in question. Among these, context 6 is the most informative regarding Michael C. Hall's career, so it ranks next. The remaining contexts are ranked based on their relevance to Michael C. Hall and the series "Dexter," as they provide background information that could lead to identifying the film.
idx: [5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 5 ("Gamer (film)"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Gamer," a 2009 American science fiction action film, and states that it was written and directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. It also mentions Michael C. Hall, the actor who played Dexter Morgan, as part of the cast, directly answering the claim. 2. Context idx 6 ("Michael C. Hall"): This context is about Michael C. Hall and mentions his role as Dexter Morgan, making it relevant to the claim. However, it does not provide information about the directors of the film he starred in. 3. Context idx 1 ("Dexter (TV series)"): This context provides extensive information about the TV series "Dexter" and Michael C. Hall's role in it. It is relevant to the claim but less so than the context that mentions the film and its directors. 4. Context idx 0 ("List of Dexter episodes"): This context provides detailed information about the TV series "Dexter" and its episodes. It is relevant due to the mention of Michael C. Hall and the series, but it does not directly answer the claim about the film's directors.
idx: [5,6,1,0]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the directors of a 2009 American science fiction film in which Michael C. Hall, known for playing Dexter Morgan, starred. Context 5, "Gamer (film)," is the most relevant as it directly mentions the film and provides the names of the directors, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. Context 6, "Michael C. Hall," is the second most relevant as it confirms Michael C. Hall's role in "Dexter" and his involvement in the film industry during the relevant time period, although it does not mention the film "Gamer" or its directors. The other contexts are about the "Dexter" TV series and do not provide information about the film or its directors.

Question:Considered the strongest recorded tropical cyclone, which cyclone had a film made about it in 2007?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the context that directly mentions a film made about a cyclone, as this is the key part of the claim. Context 6 titled 'Kathantara' is the most relevant because it explicitly mentions a film made about the 1999 Odisha cyclone. Next, I will look for contexts that mention the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, as this is also part of the claim. Context 3 mentions Cyclone Inigo, tied as the most intense in the Australian basin, and context 5 mentions Cyclone Gonu, the strongest in the Arabian Sea. These are relevant but less so than context 6. The remaining contexts will be ranked based on their relevance to the claim's details about strong cyclones and historical significance. Contexts that do not mention specific cyclones or their impact will be ranked lower.
idx: [6,3,5,0,1,2,4,7]

step-by-step think: 1. "1999 Odisha cyclone" context: This context is highly relevant as it details the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which is considered the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and matches the claim's reference to a strong cyclone. It also mentions the cyclone's impact and intensity, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Kathantara" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it mentions a film made about the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which aligns with the claim's reference to a film made in 2007. 3. "Cyclone Gonu" context: Although this context talks about a strong cyclone in 2007, it does not mention a film being made about it, making it less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. "Cyclone Hondo" context: This context discusses another strong cyclone from 2007 but, like the Gonu context, does not mention a film, making it relevant but not as much as the first two contexts. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention films or are not directly related to the claim.
idx: [3, 6, 5, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the strongest recorded tropical cyclone which also had a film made about it in 2007. 1. "1999 Odisha cyclone" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 1999 Odisha cyclone being the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean, which aligns with the claim. Additionally, it provides a detailed account of the cyclone's development and impact. 2. "Kathantara" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it mentions a film made about the 1999 Odisha cyclone in 2007, which is the specific information the claim is seeking. 3. "Cyclone Gonu" context: While this context talks about Cyclone Gonu being the strongest in the Arabian Sea, it does not mention a film, making it less relevant to the claim. 4. "Cyclone Hondo" context: This context discusses Cyclone Hondo in detail, but like the Gonu context, it does not mention a film, making it less relevant to the claim.

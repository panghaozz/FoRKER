"Ed Wood" context: This context directly mentions Ed Wood and confirms his American nationality. It is highly relevant and likely contains the other part of the answer to the claim. 3. "Ed Wood (film)" context: While this context is about the film named after Ed Wood, it does not directly confirm his nationality but is related to him. 4. "Conrad Brooks" context: This context mentions Conrad Brooks, an actor who appeared in Ed Wood's films, indicating relevance to Ed Wood. 5. "Deliver Us from Evil (2014 film)" context: This context is about a film directed by Scott Derrickson, showing relevance to him. 6. "Doctor Strange (2016 film)" context: This context is about another film directed by Scott Derrickson, further indicating relevance. 7.

step-by-step think: 1. "Scott Derrickson" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms Scott Derrickson's nationality as American. 2. "Ed Wood" context: This context is equally relevant because it confirms Ed Wood's nationality, also as American. Both contexts are directly related to the claim and provide the necessary information to answer it. 3. "Ed Wood (film)" context: While this context is about the biographical film of Ed Wood, it is less directly related to the claim compared to the first two contexts. However, it is still relevant as it pertains to Ed Wood and could potentially contain further information about his nationality.

The most relevant context would be the one that mentions Shirley Temple, the actress who played Corliss Archer, and her government positions. 1.

"Kiss and Tell (1945 film)" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the film and Shirley Temple's role in it. 3. "Janet Waldo" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions Janet Waldo, who voiced the character on radio, not in the film. 4. "Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)" context: This context is relevant to the character but not directly to Shirley Temple or her government position. 5. "A Kiss for Corliss" context: This context is relevant as it is related to the sequel of the film in question. 6.

It directly answers the claim. 2. "Kiss and Tell (1945 film)" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the film "Kiss and Tell" and Shirley Temple's role as Corliss Archer. However, it does not provide information about her government position, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first context. 3. "Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)" context: This context is informative as it discusses the television adaptation of the radio series "Meet Corliss Archer," but it does not mention Shirley Temple or her government position, making it less relevant to the claim.

idx: [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Local H" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Local H is an American rock band, directly addressing part of the claim. 2. "For Against" context: This context is equally relevant because it verifies that For Against is a band from the United States, thus answering the other part of the claim. 3. "Suffrajett" context: While this context is about another United States rock band and mentions touring with Local H, it is less directly related to the claim than the first two contexts. However, it still provides relevant information that connects to Local H, making it the third most relevant context. The remaining contexts do not directly address the claim about the bands' origins and are therefore not ranked in the top three.

Question:What screenwriter with credits for "Evolution" co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni?
golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, the informativeness of the context, and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim asks for a screenwriter with credits for "Evolution" who co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. 

1. Context 8 is the most relevant because it mentions "The Family Man," which stars Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni, and is written by David Weissman, who also has credits for "Evolution."
2. Context 5 mentions David Weissman and lists "The Family Man" and "Evolution" among his film credits, directly answering the claim.
3. Context 3 mentions a film starring Téa Leoni, but it does not involve Nicolas Cage or the screenwriter in question, so it is less relevant.

5. Context 0 mentions a film directed by Dominic Sena, who also directed "Gone in 60 Seconds," which starred Nicolas Cage, but this is still less relevant to the claim.

Question:What year did Guns N Roses perform a promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective?
golden idx: [1, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a specific year when Guns N' Roses performed a promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. The most relevant context would be one that mentions Guns N' Roses in relation to a movie soundtrack and Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. Context 1 mentions the song "Oh My God" by Guns N' Roses released in 1999 on the soundtrack to the film "End of Days", which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. This context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. Context 8 also mentions the film "End of Days" and provides additional details about the movie, making it the second most relevant. Context 9, which is Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography, may contain information about the movie and the year, ranking it third. Context 2 mentions the film "Last Action Hero", which stars Schwarzenegger as a police detective, but it is not the movie in question, so it ranks lower. Context 4 mentions Guns N' Roses in relation to a concert venue, which is less relevant. Contexts 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are even less relevant as they do not mention the movie or the promo directly.
idx: [1, 8, 9, 2, 4, 0, 3, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is about a specific event where Guns N' Roses performed a promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. The year of the event is the key information needed.
1. "Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the song by Guns N' Roses that was released on the soundtrack for the film "End of Days" in 1999, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. It also states that the song was used as a promo, directly answering the claim.
2. "End of Days (film)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides details about the film "End of Days," including its release year (1999) and the fact that it starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. It is informative and directly related to the claim.
3. "Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography" context: This context is less relevant than the first two because it does not specifically mention the promo event or the involvement of Guns N' Roses, but it is still informative as it discusses Arnold Schwarzenegger's film career and mentions his association with Guns N' Roses in music videos.
The other contexts are less relevant because they either mention different films or aspects of Guns N' Roses that are not directly related to the claim.

"Random House Tower" context: Similarly, this context is very relevant because it describes the Random House Tower as a mixed-use tower with headquarters and apartments, indicating its real estate purpose. 3. "Pershing Square Capital Management" context: This context mentions 888 7th Avenue as the location of a hedge fund management company, which adds to the real estate relevance of the building. 4. "Real estate benchmarking" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the measurement and analysis of real estate properties, which could be applicable to the buildings in question. 5. "Real estate technology" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it talks about the industry of real estate technology, which may relate to the buildings' use. 6. "Villard (imprint)" context: This context is less directly relevant but still pertinent as it mentions Random House, which is associated with the Random House Tower. 7. "Loan modification in the United States" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on loan modifications rather than real estate usage, but it still pertains to the broader real estate market. 8. "Hounsfield Heights/Briar Hill, Calgary" context: This context is the least relevant to the claim as it discusses a neighborhood in Calgary, which is unrelated to the buildings in New York.
idx: [1, 2, 4, 6, 0, 3, 5, 8]

step-by-step think: The claim asks whether Random House Tower and 888 7th Avenue are both used for real estate. To rank the contexts, I will consider how directly each context relates to the claim and the likelihood of it containing the answer.
1. "888 7th Avenue" context: This context is highly relevant as it describes 888 7th Avenue as an office skyscraper with corporate headquarters, directly addressing the claim about its use in real estate.
2. "Random House Tower" context: This context is also highly relevant as it describes the Random House Tower being used as a headquarters for a book publisher and a luxury apartment complex, which pertains to real estate usage.

5. "Real estate benchmarking" context: This context talks about real estate benchmarking in general and does not mention the buildings in question, so it is not directly relevant to the claim.
6. "South Phoenix" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention either building or their use in real estate.
7. "Loan modification in the United States" context: This context discusses loan modifications in the U.S. and does not mention the buildings or real estate usage, so it is not relevant to the claim.
8. "Hounsfield Heights/Briar Hill, Calgary" context: This context is about a neighborhood in Calgary and does not relate to the claim about buildings in New York City, so it is not relevant.

Context idx 6: The Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex context is informative about Matt Busby but less directly related to the claim. 8. Context idx 5: "David Beckham's Soccer USA" context is about Beckham's time in the USA, which is less relevant to the claim about his recruitment and Manchester United's manager.
idx: [9, 4, 7, 3, 0, 1, 6, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the timeframe during which the football manager who recruited David Beckham managed Manchester United. 1.

Question:Brown State Fishing Lake is in a country that has a population of how many inhabitants ?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about the population of the country where Brown State Fishing Lake is located, we need to identify contexts that mention Brown State Fishing Lake and provide information about its location. Context 9 directly mentions Brown State Fishing Lake and its location in Brown County, Kansas, USA. This is highly relevant as it can lead us to the population of the country (USA). Context 0 also mentions Brown County, Kansas, and provides population data, which is relevant to the claim. Contexts 2, 3, and 8 mention other lakes in Kansas, which could be indirectly relevant since they establish the location of the lakes in the USA. Contexts 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 mention lakes in locations other than the USA (Canada and Michigan) and are therefore not relevant to the claim about the population of the country where Brown State Fishing Lake is located.
idx: [9, 0, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the population of the country where Brown State Fishing Lake is located. 1. "Brown County, Kansas" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Brown County, where Brown State Fishing Lake is located, and provides information about the population of the county. However, it does not provide the population of the country. 2. "Brown State Fishing Lake" context: This context is relevant because it describes the location of Brown State Fishing Lake, but it does not mention the population of the country. 3. "Neosho State Fishing Lake" context: This context is about another fishing lake in Kansas and includes details about its operation by the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, which suggests a connection to the state and potentially the country's population. However, it is less directly relevant than the first two contexts.

step-by-step think: To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments and the number of people in each act. Context 2 mentions Badly Drawn Boy as a multi-instrumentalist, which suggests a high instrument to person ratio. Context 0 describes Wolf Alice as a four-piece band, which implies a lower instrument to person ratio compared to a solo multi-instrumentalist. Context 4 provides additional information about Badly Drawn Boy's discography, indicating the variety of instruments he might play. Context 8 also supports this by mentioning that Badly Drawn Boy wrote, produced, and played several instruments on his album. The other contexts are less directly relevant to the claim but provide background information about Badly Drawn Boy and his work, which might indirectly inform about his use of instruments.
idx: [2, 4, 8, 0, 1, 3, 5, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments compared to the number of people in each act. 1. "Badly Drawn Boy" context: This context indicates that Badly Drawn Boy is a stage name for a single individual, Damon Gough, who is a multi-instrumentalist. This suggests a high instrument to person ratio since one person plays multiple instruments. 2. "Wolf Alice" context: This context describes Wolf Alice as a four-piece band. This implies that the instrument to person ratio is likely lower than that of a solo multi-instrumentalist, as there are four people in the band. 3. "The Hour of Bewilderbeast" context: Although this context provides information about Badly Drawn Boy's album and mentions other musicians' involvement, it does not directly address the instrument to person ratio. However, it does reinforce the idea that Badly Drawn Boy, as a solo artist, plays several instruments.

"Kasper Schmeichel" context: This context is relevant as it establishes the relationship between Kasper Schmeichel and his father, Peter Schmeichel, which is central to the claim.

"Screaming Trees" context: This context mentions four members initially and one replacement, but does not specify if there were more members at any point, making it less likely to contain the complete answer to the claim. 3. "Gary Lee Conner" and "Van Conner" contexts: While these provide additional information about individual members of Screaming Trees, they do not offer a complete list of members or indicate the total number of members in the band. 4. "Screaming Trees discography" context: This context is informative about the band's releases but does not provide information about the number of members. 5. "Beat Happening/Screaming Trees" context: This context is about a collaboration and does not provide information about the number of members in Screaming Trees. 6.

step-by-step think: The claim specifically asks for the end date of the civil war during which Alexander Kerensky was defeated by the Bolsheviks. 1. "Russian Civil War" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides detailed information about the Russian Civil War, including the start and end dates, the main combatant groups, and the outcome. It directly addresses the claim and is likely to contain the answer. 2. "Socialist Revolutionary Party" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the party that Kerensky was associated with and mentions the civil war and the defeat of Kerensky's faction. It provides background information that is informative and related to the claim. 3. "Alexander Kerensky" context: This context is about Kerensky himself and includes information about his role in the government and his overthrow by the Bolsheviks. While it does not directly mention the end date of the civil war, it is closely related to Kerensky and the events surrounding his defeat.

Question:Seven Brief Lessons on Physics was written by an Italian physicist that has worked in France since what year?
golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the book "Seven Brief Lessons on Physics" and its author, an Italian physicist who has worked in France since a certain year. The context that directly mentions the book and the author, Carlo Rovelli, is the most relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. Therefore, context 8 is ranked highest. Context 5 mentions Carlo Rovelli and his work in France, which is highly relevant to the claim, so it is ranked second. The other contexts mention various Italian physicists and their work, but they do not directly relate to the claim about Carlo Rovelli and his book. However, they might contain useful background information about Italian physicists and their international work, which could be indirectly relevant. Contexts 4 and 3 mention "brief lessons" and theoretical physics, which might be tangentially related to the claim, so they are ranked next. The remaining contexts are ranked based on the relevance of their content to the field of physics and the likelihood of containing information about Italian physicists working abroad, which could provide indirect context to the claim.
idx: [8, 5, 4, 3, 7, 1, 2, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Carlo Rovelli" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Carlo Rovelli, the author of "Seven Brief Lessons on Physics," and states that he has worked in France since 2000. It is directly related to the claim and provides the specific year which answers the question. 2. "Seven Brief Lessons on Physics" context: This context is relevant because it talks about the book mentioned in the claim and the author, Carlo Rovelli. However, it does not provide information about the year Rovelli started working in France. 3. "Micropædia" context: This context is less relevant than the first two. It mentions the term "brief lessons," which is similar to the book's title, but it does not provide any information about Carlo Rovelli or his work in France.

Question:The Livesey Hal War Memorial commemorates the fallen of which war, that had over 60 million casualties?
golden idx: [2, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim specifically asks about the Livesey Hall War Memorial and the war it commemorates with over 60 million casualties. The context that directly mentions the Livesey Hall War Memorial is the most relevant and likely to contain the answer, which is context 2. It states that the memorial commemorates the fallen of World War I and World War II. Since the question specifies a war with over 60 million casualties, this points to World War II, as indicated by context 5, which provides detailed casualty statistics for World War II. Contexts 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 mention other memorials and wars, but since they do not directly answer the claim, they are ranked lower. Context 7 mentions the Vietnam War, which is not relevant to the claim.
idx: [2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Livesey Hall War Memorial" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the Livesey Hall War Memorial and specifies that it commemorates the fallen of both World War I and World War II. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "World War II casualties" context: This context is relevant because it provides detailed information about the casualties of World War II, which had over 60 million casualties, aligning with the claim's details. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Tower Hill Memorial" context: While this context is about a different war memorial, it mentions that it commemorates those who died during both world wars, which makes it somewhat relevant. However, it might not be as likely to contain the specific answer to the claim as the contexts that directly mention the Livesey Hall War Memorial or World War II casualties.

Ford Freeway) mentions Michigan and could be misleading but is less relevant than the direct mentions of the airports. Context 3 (Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library) is located in Michigan and is related to Gerald R. Ford but does not provide information about the airport's location. Context 7 (Bishop International Airport) mentions an airport in Michigan but is not directly related to the claim. Contexts 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9 are not relevant to the claim as they do not provide information about the locations of the airports in question.
idx: [1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 0, 2, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim asks whether both Elko Regional Airport and Gerald R. Ford International Airport are located in Michigan. To answer this, we need to identify the locations of both airports. 1. "Gerald R. Ford International Airport" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms the location of Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Michigan. It directly answers half of the claim. 2. "Elko Regional Airport" context: This context is equally important because it provides the location of Elko Regional Airport, which is in Nevada, not Michigan. This context directly answers the other half of the claim. 3. "Bishop International Airport" context: While this context is about an airport in Michigan, it does not directly answer the claim but is still relevant to the topic of airports in Michigan. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not pertain to the locations of the airports in question.

It is written and illustrated by Masakazu Katsura, which is the information needed to answer the claim. 2. Context 6: This context provides a biography of Masakazu Katsura, including his birth year, which is the specific answer to the claim. 3. Context 0: While this context mentions a manga series and a character named Seto, it is not about "I"s" or Ichitaka Seto. However, it may confuse the search due to the name similarity. 4. Context 1: This context is about a different manga series but is informative and could be considered if the user was looking for manga illustrators in general. 5. Context 2: This context is about another manga series and its illustrator, which is less relevant but still within the manga domain. 6.

Context with 'idx': 3 is the second most relevant as it provides detailed information about Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet statesman in question, which is highly relevant to the claim. 3. Context with 'idx': 9 is the third most relevant as it talks about Anastas Mikoyan, another Soviet statesman, and while it does not directly answer the claim, it provides context about Soviet statesmanship which could be informative.

golden idx: [1, 4]
step-by-step think: The claim asks whether Ferocactus and Silene are both types of plants. To rank the contexts, I will consider how directly each context relates to the claim and how likely it is to contain the answer. 1. Context idx 4 ("Ferocactus"): This context is highly relevant as it describes the Ferocactus genus, confirming it is a type of plant. 2. Context idx 1 ("Silene"): This context is equally relevant because it describes the Silene genus, confirming it is a type of plant. 3. Context idx 0 ("Silene menziesii"): This context is about a specific species within the Silene genus, which supports the claim. 4. Context idx 2 ("Silene conoidea"): This context is about another specific species within the Silene genus, which is relevant to the claim. 5. Context idx 3 ("Silene tomentosa"): This context discusses a rare species within the Silene genus, adding to the relevance. 6. Context idx 5 ("Silene antirrhina"): This context provides information on another species within the Silene genus. 7. Context idx 6 ("Silene suksdorfii"): This context is about a species in the Silene genus found in the Pacific Northwest, which is relevant. 8. Context idx 7 ("Sex determination in Silene"): This context discusses the reproductive system of Silene, which is less directly related to the claim but still relevant as it confirms Silene is a plant.
idx: [4,1,0,2,3,5,6,7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Ferocactus" context: It directly relates to the claim as it mentions "Ferocactus" and confirms it is a genus of cacti, which are plants. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Silene" context: This context directly mentions "Silene," confirming it is a genus of flowering plants. It is equally relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Silene menziesii" context: While this context is about a specific species within the "Silene" genus, it supports the claim by providing additional information on a type of "Silene" plant, making it relevant and informative. The other contexts are also relevant but are about specific species or aspects of "Silene" and do not add different information than what is provided in the top contexts.

Question:Which British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II?
golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for a specific British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions a British jet-powered medium bomber and its use in the South West Pacific theatre during the specified time period. 

1. Context idx 5: "English Electric Canberra" context: This is the most relevant context as it directly mentions the "English Electric Canberra," which is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. It also provides detailed information about the aircraft's development and service introduction, which is likely to contain the answer to the claim.

2. Context idx 3: "No. 12 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is relevant as it discusses a squadron that operated in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and mentions bomber operations, which could potentially include the British bomber in question.

3. Context idx 8: "No. 2 Squadron RAAF" context: Similar to idx 3, this context talks about a squadron that saw action in the South West Pacific theatre and mentions the use of English Electric Canberra jets, aligning with the claim.

4. Context idx 6: "South West Pacific theatre of World War II" context: This context is informative as it describes the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, which is the location mentioned in the claim. However, it does not specify the bomber, making it less likely to contain the answer than contexts that do.

5. Context idx 1: "South West Pacific Area (command)" context: This context provides background on the South West Pacific Area command but does not mention specific aircraft, making it less relevant than contexts that discuss bombers.

6. Context idx 7: "Asiatic-Pacific Theater" context: This context provides information on the broader Pacific theatre operations but is less relevant to the claim as it does not focus on the South West Pacific theatre or mention specific British bombers.

7. Context idx 4: "Coastwatchers" context: While this context is related to the South West Pacific theatre, it focuses on intelligence operations rather than bomber aircraft, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

8. Context idx 2: "Edwin A. Doss" context: This context discusses an American fighter pilot in the South West Pacific Theatre, which is only tangentially related to the claim about a British bomber.

The remaining contexts (idx 0, idx 9) are not relevant as they do not pertain to British bombers or the South West Pacific theatre during World War II.

idx: [5,3,8,6,1,7,4,2]

step-by-step think: 1. "English Electric Canberra" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the English Electric Canberra, a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. It provides detailed information about the aircraft's development, introduction to service, and its role as the RAF's first jet-powered bomber. However, it specifies that the Canberra was introduced in May 1951, which is after World War II, thus it may not contain the answer to the claim about the bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. 2. "No. 12 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is relevant as it discusses a squadron that saw combat in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. It mentions the squadron's activities and changes throughout the war, including its role as a bomber unit, which makes it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "No. 2 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is also relevant because it details a squadron's history, including its action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. It also mentions the use of English Electric Canberra jets, but these were used post-World War II, which reduces its relevance to the claim. 4. "South West Pacific theatre of World War II" context: This context provides an overview of the South West Pacific theatre during World War II, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not mention specific bombers or aircraft, making it less likely to contain the answer. 5. "South West Pacific Area (command)" context: This context describes the command structure in the South West Pacific Theatre of World War II, which is relevant to the claim. It does not provide information on specific aircraft, so it may not contain the answer. 6. "Asiatic-Pacific Theater" context: This context discusses the broader Pacific War theater and command structures but does not focus on the South West Pacific or mention specific bombers. It is informative but less relevant to the claim. 7. "Coastwatchers" context: This context is about intelligence operations in the Pacific theatre, which is tangentially related to the claim but unlikely to contain the answer. 8. "Edwin A. Doss" context: This context focuses on an individual's service in the South West Pacific Theatre, which is relevant, but it does not mention specific bombers, making it less likely to contain the answer.

Question:Which year and which conference was the 14th season for this conference as part of the NCAA Division that the Colorado Buffaloes played in with a record of 2-6 in conference play?
golden idx: [1, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, which asks for the specific year and conference of the 14th season for the NCAA Division that the Colorado Buffaloes played in with a record of 2-6 in conference play. 
1. Context 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 2009 Big 12 Conference football season, which is the 14th season for the Big 12. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 7: This context is relevant because it discusses the 2009 Colorado Buffaloes football team, which played in the Big 12 Conference during its 14th season. It also mentions a 2-6 conference play record, directly answering the claim.
3. Context 0: This context mentions the 2014 Colorado Buffaloes football team and their record, but it does not specify the 14th season of the conference, making it slightly less relevant.
4. Context 5: This context is about the 2015 Colorado Buffaloes football team, which is not the year in question, but it is still relevant to the football team's performance in conference play.
5. Context 8: The 2011 Colorado Buffaloes football team context is relevant as it discusses their first year in the Pac-12, which could be mistaken for the 14th season in a conference.
6. Context 9: The 2012 Colorado Buffaloes football team context is relevant to the team's history but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim.
7. Context 4: The 1989 Colorado Buffaloes football team context is informative about the team's history but not relevant to the claim about the 14th season.
8. Context 3: The 2014–15 men's basketball team context is less relevant as it pertains to basketball, not football.
9. Context 2: The 2015–16 men's basketball team context is also less relevant for the same reason as above.
10. Context 6: The 2016–17 men's basketball team context is the least relevant as it is about a different sport and a different time period.

idx: [1, 7, 0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 3]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the specific year and conference of the 14th season that the Colorado Buffaloes played in with a 2-6 record in conference play. 1. "2009 Big 12 Conference football season" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 14th season for the Big 12, which aligns with the claim's request for the 14th season of a conference. It also pertains to the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season, which is likely the correct time frame. 2. "2009 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it discusses the 2009 Colorado Buffaloes football team and their record in Big 12 play, which matches the 2-6 record mentioned in the claim. 3. "2011 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: Although this context is about the Colorado Buffaloes, it refers to their first year in the Pac-12 Conference, which does not match the claim's reference to the 14th season of a conference. However, it is still more relevant than other contexts that discuss different years or sports.

Question:In 1991 Euromarché was bought by a chain that operated how any hypermarkets at the end of 2016?
golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is about Euromarché being bought by a chain and the number of hypermarkets that chain operated at the end of 2016. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions Euromarché and the chain that bought it, as well as the number of hypermarkets. Context 6 directly mentions Euromarché and its acquisition by Carrefour, which is crucial information for the claim. Context 0 mentions Carrefour and the number of hypermarkets it had at the end of 2016, which directly answers the claim. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not pertain to Euromarché or Carrefour. Context 1 mentions Tazweed Center, which is unrelated. Context 2 mentions Tesco Extra, another unrelated chain. Context 3 talks about John A. Brown, a department store chain, which is also unrelated. Context 4 discusses Lewis's, a British department store chain, with no connection to the claim. Context 5 talks about SavaCentre, which is a different hypermarket chain and does not answer the claim. Context 7 discusses Selver, an Estonian chain, which is irrelevant to the claim. Context 8 talks about Uno-X, a fuel station chain, which is unrelated. Context 9 discusses Holiday Inn, a hotel chain, which is also unrelated.
idx: [0, 6, 5, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Carrefour" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Carrefour, the chain that bought Euromarché, and provides the exact number of hypermarkets it operated at the end of 2016, which directly answers the claim. 2. "Euromarché" context: This context is relevant because it confirms that Euromarché was bought by Carrefour in 1991, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not provide the number of hypermarkets Carrefour operated, so it's less informative regarding the specific question. 3. "SavaCentre" context: While this context talks about a hypermarket chain, it is not relevant to the claim since it does not mention the acquisition of Euromarché or the number of hypermarkets operated by the acquiring chain. The other contexts are not relevant as they do not pertain to Carrefour or Euromarché.

Question:What race track in the midwest hosts a 500 mile race eavery May?
golden idx: [2, 4]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for a race track in the Midwest that hosts a 500 mile race every May. The most relevant context would be one that mentions a race track located in the Midwest, specifically hosting a 500 mile race in May. 

1. Context idx 2: "Indianapolis Motor Speedway" is highly relevant as it is located in the Midwest and is the home of the Indianapolis 500, which is a 500 mile race held in May.
2. Context idx 3: "Allison Transmission" is relevant because it discusses the founding of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the first Indianapolis 500 mile race.

5. Context idx 7: "Louis Schwitzer Award" is somewhat relevant as it is associated with the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race.
6. Context idx 1: "Carolina Dodge Dealers 400" mentions a 500 mile race, but it is not in the Midwest and not specifically in May.
7. Context idx 8: "Subway 400" mentions a 500 mile race, but again, it is not in the Midwest and not in May.
8. Context idx 0: "Lean Horse Ultramarathon" is not relevant as it is an ultramarathon, not a car race.
9. Context idx 5: "Orange County Fair Speedway" is not relevant as it does not mention a 500 mile race in May.
10. Context idx 9: "1964 Armstrong 500" is not relevant as it is a race in Australia, not the Midwest.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the contexts are ranked as follows:

step-by-step think: 1. "Indianapolis Motor Speedway" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which is known for hosting the Indianapolis 500 mile race every May. It provides specific information about the location and the events held there, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the city where the "Prince of tenors" starred in a film based on an opera by Giacomo Puccini. The "Prince of tenors" refers to Franco Corelli, and the context must mention a film in which he starred that is based on a Puccini opera. 1. Context 0 is highly relevant as it mentions the film "Tosca" starring Franco Corelli and specifies it was made in Rome. 2. Context 8 directly refers to Franco Corelli, the "Prince of tenors," and mentions his international opera career and stage presence, but does not mention the film or city. 3.

5. Context idx 0: It talks about the song "Army" from "Delirium" but doesn't mention other writers.

idx: [1, 7, 5, 9, 0, 8, 6, 3]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how directly they relate to the claim about Ellie Goulding's collaboration with other writers on her album "Delirium". 1.

Question:who is younger Keith Bostic or Jerry Glanville ?
golden idx: [0, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Keith Bostic and Jerry Glanville, we need to compare their birth dates. Context 0 provides Keith Bostic's birth date as January 17, 1961. Context 7 provides Jerry Glanville's birth date as October 14, 1941. Based on these dates, Keith Bostic is younger than Jerry Glanville. The contexts that contain the birth dates are the most relevant and informative for answering the question. Therefore, they should be ranked highest.

They are ranked based on the presence of either individual's name and the context's potential to contain related information, even if it does not directly answer the question.

idx: [0,7,1,3,4,5,6,8]

step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Keith Bostic or Jerry Glanville, we need to compare their birth dates. 1. "Keith Bostic (American football)" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth date of Keith Bostic, which is essential to answer the claim. 2. "Jerry Glanville" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides the exact birth date of Jerry Glanville, allowing for a direct comparison with Keith Bostic's age. 3.

However, it is still informative and more relevant than the other contexts because it discusses Glanville's tenure, which is related to the time frame in question. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not provide direct information about the birth dates or are less focused on the individuals in question.

Context 0 is directly relevant as it mentions the nursery rhyme "What Are Little Boys Made Of?" which is closely related to the claim and provides a Roud Index number. 2. Context 1 is also highly relevant because it discusses an episode titled "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" and references the nursery rhyme in question. 3.

Context 0 is directly relevant as it mentions "What Are Little Boys Made Of?" and provides its Roud Folk Song Index number, which is likely the same as the one inspiring "What Are Little Girls Made Of?". Context 1 mentions the title "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" but does not provide the Roud Folk Song Index number, making it informative but less likely to contain the answer. Contexts 7, 8, 5, 9, 2, and 3 mention other nursery rhymes with their respective Roud Folk Song Index numbers, but they are not directly related to the claim. Therefore, they are informative but less relevant.

golden idx: [4, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the league cup Wigan Athletic F.C. competed in during the 2017–18 season and its sponsorship name. 1. "EFL Cup" context: This context is highly relevant as it describes the EFL Cup, which is a league cup competition in English football and mentions its sponsorship name, making it likely to contain the answer. 2. "2017–18 Wigan Athletic F.C. season" context: This context directly relates to the claim as it discusses the specific season in question for Wigan Athletic F.C., including their participation in the EFL Cup. 3. "2007–08 Wigan Athletic F.C. season" context: This context is relevant as it pertains to Wigan Athletic F.C.'s participation in league seasons, which may include information about the league cup under sponsorship names. 4. "1979–80 Wigan Athletic F.C. season" context: Similar to the previous context, this one is relevant due to its focus on Wigan Athletic F.C.'s history in league competitions. 5.

"2006–07 Wigan Athletic F.C. season" context: This context is less relevant than the others as it is further removed from the 2017–18 season but still pertains to Wigan Athletic F.C.'s league participation. 7. "Nick Powell" context: This context is related to a player from Wigan Athletic F.C. and could contain incidental information about the league cup. 8. "Springfield Park (Wigan)" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on the stadium rather than the team's competitions. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim and are therefore not included in the top 8.

"East Lempster, New Hampshire" context: This context is relevant as it confirms that East Lempster is in Sullivan County. However, it does not provide information about the county seat, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to the first two contexts. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not pertain to Sullivan County or its county seat.

To rank the contexts, I will consider how directly they relate to Robert C Seger, the album "Against the Wind", and any mention of his stage name.

It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

Goldberg dealt with the constitutionality of the draft. It is informative and likely to contain related information. 3.

It is likely to contain supporting information that could help answer the claim. 3.

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the name of a woman who was a former White House intern and is mentioned in the book "Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine." 1. "Their Lives" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly relates to the book mentioned in the claim and lists the women involved with Bill Clinton, including former White House interns. 2.

Question:When was the American lawyer, lobbyist and political consultant who was a senior member of the presidential campaign of Donald Trump born?
golden idx: [8, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim is about the birth date of an American lawyer, lobbyist, and political consultant who was a senior member of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. 

1. Context idx 9 ("Paul Manafort"): This context is directly relevant as it mentions Paul Manafort, who fits the description in the claim, and provides his birth date, which is the answer to the question.
2. Context idx 5 ("Brad Parscale"): This context is relevant as it mentions Brad Parscale, another senior member of Trump's campaign, and provides his birth date. While not the specific individual in the claim, it is closely related.
3. Context idx 1 ("Tony Fabrizio"): This context is relevant because it mentions Tony Fabrizio, a senior member of Trump's campaign, and provides his birth year, which is partially informative to the claim.
4. Context idx 2 ("David Urban"): This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions David Urban, a senior advisor in Trump's campaign, and provides an approximate birth year.
5. Context idx 0 ("Donald Trump in music"): This context is less relevant as it focuses on Trump's references in music rather than the campaign team or their birth dates.
6. Context idx 4 ("Donald Trump (Last Week Tonight)"): This context is less relevant as it discusses a TV show segment about Trump, not his campaign team or their birth dates.
7. Context idx 3 ("Protests against Donald Trump"): This context is not directly relevant to the claim as it focuses on protests against Trump rather than information about his campaign team or their birth dates.
8. Context idx 7 ("Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000"): This context is not directly relevant to the claim as it discusses Trump's campaign in 2000, not the birth dates of his campaign team members.
9. Context idx 6 ("Immigration policy of Donald Trump"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it focuses on Trump's immigration policy.
10. Context idx 8 ("Trump campaign–Russian meeting"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a specific meeting related to Trump's campaign, not the birth dates of his campaign team members.

Based on the above evaluation, the top 8 ranked contexts are:
idx: [9, 5, 1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the birth date of Paul Manafort, who was a senior member of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. 1. "Paul Manafort" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Paul Manafort by name and provides information about his birth date, which is the answer to the claim. It is highly informative and directly contains the answer. 2. "Brad Parscale" context: While this context is about another senior member of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, it does not provide information about Paul Manafort or his birth date. It is less relevant and unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Tony Fabrizio" context: Similar to the Brad Parscale context, this one is about a different individual associated with Donald Trump's campaign and does not mention Paul Manafort or his birth date. It is also less relevant and unlikely to contain the answer. 4. "David Urban" context: Again, this context is about a different person and does not mention Paul Manafort or his birth date, making it less relevant and unlikely to contain the answer. 5. "Donald Trump in music" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses Donald Trump's influence in music, not Paul Manafort or his birth date. It is the least likely to contain the answer. 6. "Donald Trump (Last Week Tonight)" context: This context is about a television segment on Donald Trump and does not provide information about Paul Manafort or his birth date. It is not relevant to the claim. 7. "Protests against Donald Trump" context: This context discusses protests against Donald Trump and does not mention Paul Manafort or his birth date, making it irrelevant to the claim. 8. "Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000" context: Although this context is about Donald Trump's presidential campaign, it does not mention Paul Manafort or his birth date and is therefore not relevant to the claim.

This context is highly relevant as it directly connects Mutarelli with the novel "Nina" is based on. 2.

It is relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. 3.

Context 6 discusses "Crime and Punishment," which is the novel "Nina" is based on, according to context 3. This context is relevant as it provides the publication year of the novel. 5. The remaining contexts are about different novels and authors and do not seem to be directly relevant to the claim about Mutarelli's novel. They are informative but unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [3, 0, 4, 6, 1, 2, 5, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 6 "Crime and Punishment": This context is highly relevant as it mentions the novel "Crime and Punishment" by Dostoyevsky, which is the novel that "Nina" was based on. It provides the exact publication year of the novel, which is the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 3 "Lourenço Mutarelli": This context is relevant because it connects Lourenço Mutarelli to the animated sequences of the movie "Nina" and mentions that it was based on "Crime and Punishment". However, it does not provide the publication year of the novel. 3. Context idx 0 "Drained": This context mentions a film based on a novel by Lourenço Mutarelli and provides a publication year, but it is for the film, not the novel "Crime and Punishment". It is less relevant than the first two contexts but still connected to Mutarelli's work.

The context that directly mentions sales figures or implies the popularity which could be linked to sales will be ranked higher. 1.

It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

Context 2 titled "The Conversation (website)" is the second most relevant because it provides detailed information about "The Conversation", the not-for-profit media outlet co-founded by Andrew Jaspan. 3. Context 3 titled "Accessible Media" is less relevant than the first two contexts as it does not mention Andrew Jaspan or "The Conversation", but it is still about a not-for-profit media company, which makes it slightly relevant to the claim. The remaining contexts are about different not-for-profit media outlets or unrelated topics and do not mention Andrew Jaspan or "The Conversation".

Question:Which American film director hosted the 18th Independent Spirit Awards in 2002?
golden idx: [3, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the context that directly answers the claim, which is the context titled '18th Independent Spirit Awards' as it specifically mentions that John Waters hosted the awards in 2002. This context is the most relevant and informative. Next, I look for contexts that are closely related to the Independent Spirit Awards and the year in question. The context titled 'John Waters' is relevant as it provides information about the individual who hosted the awards. Other contexts related to the Independent Spirit Awards, such as those discussing the awards themselves, the categories, or other ceremonies, are also relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. Contexts about individuals or films associated with the awards may be informative but are less directly related to the claim. The context about Mihai Mălaimare Jr., while mentioning the Independent Spirit Awards, is less relevant as it does not pertain to the 18th awards or the hosting role.
idx: [9, 3, 7, 0, 8, 5, 4, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with index 9 is the most relevant as it directly mentions the 18th Independent Spirit Awards and states that it was hosted by John Waters, which answers the claim. 2. Context with index 3 is the second most relevant because it provides information about John Waters, who is the answer to the claim. It is informative and directly related to the individual in question. 3. Context with index 7 is relevant as it talks about the Independent Spirit Awards in general, which is the event related to the claim. However, it does not mention the specific year or host, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to the first two contexts.

Question:Do the drinks Gibson and Zurracapote both contain gin?
golden idx: [2, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider their relevance to the claim about whether Gibson and Zurracapote both contain gin. 1. "Gibson (cocktail)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly describes the Gibson cocktail and its ingredients, which includes gin. 2. "Zurracapote" context: This context is also highly relevant as it describes the Zurracapote drink and its ingredients, which does not list gin, thus providing a direct answer to the claim. 3. "Phillips Distilling Company" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions the production of gin among other liquors, which could be informative regarding the ingredients of Gibson. 4. "Flaming beverage" context: This context is less relevant as it talks about drinks with flammable alcohol but does not specifically mention gin or the drinks in question. 5. "Gin pennant" context: This context is tangentially related due to the mention of gin, but it's about a maritime flag, not the drinks themselves. 6. "Soft drink" context: This context is not relevant to the alcoholic drinks in question. 7. "List of soft drinks by country" context: This context is also not relevant as it lists soft drinks, not alcoholic beverages like Gibson and Zurracapote. 8. "Rubicon Drinks" context: This context is not relevant; it's about a company that specializes in soft drinks. 9. "Energy shot" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses energy shots, which are different from the alcoholic drinks in question. 10. "CytoSport" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on nutritional supplements, not alcoholic beverages.
idx: [2, 9, 1, 0, 5, 6, 7, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "Gibson (cocktail)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the Gibson cocktail and confirms that it is made with gin. It is informative and definitely contains the answer to the claim regarding the Gibson drink. 2. "Zurracapote" context: This context is also relevant as it describes the Zurracapote drink. While it does not mention gin, it notes that other alcoholic beverages may be added to the recipe, which could include gin. Therefore, it is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Phillips Distilling Company" context: Although this context does not directly address the claim, it mentions that Phillips produces a variety of liquors, including gin. It could potentially contain information relevant to the claim if the company is related to the production of either Gibson or Zurracapote drinks.

golden idx: [0, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider their relevance to the claim about the annual documentary film festival presented by the fortnightly published British journal of literary essays and the likelihood that they contain the answer to the question about the month in which the festival is held. 1. "London International Documentary Festival" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the festival is presented in association with the London Review of Books, which matches the description of the journal in the claim. It also specifies the months of March and April, directly answering the question. 2. "London Review of Books" context: This context is relevant because it identifies the LRB as a British journal of literary essays published fortnightly, which is the journal mentioned in the claim. However, it does not specify the month of the festival. 3. "Doc NYC" context: This context is informative and provides the specific month of November for the festival, but it does not mention any association with the British journal, making it less relevant. 4. "New Haven Documentary Film Festival" context: This context gives specific details about the NHdocs festival, including that it occurs in June. However, it lacks any connection to the British journal, so it's less relevant. 5. "FreedomFilmFest" context: This context talks about a documentary film festival in Malaysia, which is not related to the British journal or the claim. 6. "Docville" context: This context mentions an annual documentary film festival in Belgium, which is unrelated to the British journal. 7.

Context with idx 5 is the most relevant as it directly mentions the London International Documentary Festival and its association with the London Review of Books, which is the fortnightly published British journal of literary essays mentioned in the claim. It also specifies the months of March and April, directly answering the question. 2. Context with idx 0 is the second most relevant because it provides information about the London Review of Books, establishing its connection to the documentary film festival mentioned in the first context. However, it does not specify the months of the festival. 3. Context with idx 9 is relevant as it mentions another documentary film festival, but it is less relevant than the first two contexts because it is about a different festival (Doc NYC) that takes place in November in New York City, not the one presented by the London Review of Books.

"West McLean, Virginia" context: This context is relevant as it mentions West McLean as part of Fairfax County and includes the Tysons Corner area, which is associated with Tysons Galleria. 5. "Tysons Corner Center" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions Tysons Corner Center, which is near Tysons Galleria, and is located in Fairfax County. 6. "McLean station" context: This context is less relevant as it only mentions the station's location in Tysons Corner with a McLean postal address, but it does not directly relate to Tysons Galleria. 7. "Spring Hill station" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions the station in Tysons Corner but does not provide information about Tysons Galleria or the county. 8. "Scott's Run Nature Preserve" context: This context is the least relevant of the top 8 because it only mentions its location in McLean and proximity to Tysons Corner without specific reference to Tysons Galleria or the county.

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Tysons, Virginia, being in Fairfax County, which is directly related to the claim about Tysons Galleria's location.

Question:Bordan Tkachuk was the CEO of a company that provides what sort of products?
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about Bordan Tkachuk and the likelihood of them containing the answer about the type of products his company provides. 1. "Viglen" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Viglen Ltd, the company where Bordan Tkachuk was CEO, and describes the products it provides, which are IT products and services. 2. "Bordan Tkachuk" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Bordan Tkachuk and his role as the former CEO of Viglen, which is the company in question. 3. "Compass Minerals" context: While this context is informative about a company's products, it is not directly related to Bordan Tkachuk or Viglen. 4. "Jonathan Michael Ansell" context: This context talks about a different CEO and his companies, which are not related to the claim. 5. "Terren Peizer" context: This context is about a different business executive and his companies, not related to Bordan Tkachuk or Viglen. 6. "Owens & Minor" context: This context describes a healthcare logistics company, which is unrelated to the claim about Bordan Tkachuk. 7. "BankUnited" context: This context is about a banking company and its services, which are not relevant to the claim. 8.

"Cardinal Health" context: This context is about a healthcare services company, which is also not related to the claim.
idx: [2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine the top 3 ranked contexts, I will evaluate each context based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood that it contains the answer to the question about Bordan Tkachuk's company and the products it provides.
1. Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Bordan Tkachuk directly, stating his role as the former CEO of Viglen and his appearances on "The Apprentice." It is likely to contain the answer because it connects Tkachuk with Viglen, which is the company in question.
2. Context idx 2: This context is also highly relevant because it describes Viglen Ltd and the types of products it provides, such as IT products and services. Since the question is about the products provided by the company Tkachuk was CEO of, this context is likely to contain the answer.
3. Context idx 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9: The remaining contexts mention various other companies and executives, none of which are directly related to Bordan Tkachuk or Viglen. Therefore, they are less relevant and less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
After considering the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer, the top 3 contexts based on the scores are:
- Context idx 3: Directly mentions Bordan Tkachuk and his association with Viglen.
- Context idx 2: Describes the products provided by Viglen Ltd.
- Context idx 0: Although less relevant than the first two, it is the next most informative context regarding a company's products and services, which could potentially be confused with Viglen's offerings.

Green and her work as a film producer and director, but it does not specifically highlight animation, making it slightly less relevant than the Lev Yilmaz context. 3.

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the city where the ambassador of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region to China is based. The most relevant context would be one that mentions the Moroccan ambassador to China or the administrative region itself. 1. "Moroccan Ambassador to China" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions the Moroccan ambassador in Beijing, which is likely the answer to the claim. 2. "Rabat" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Rabat as the capital city of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region. 3. "Visa policy of Hong Kong" context: This context is less relevant as it deals with visa policies of Hong Kong and does not mention the Moroccan ambassador or the administrative region. 4. "Liaison Office (Hong Kong)" context: This context is also less relevant because it discusses the Liaison Office in Hong Kong, not the Moroccan ambassador or the administrative region. 5. "Sinuiju Special Administrative Region" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a North Korean SAR. 6. "2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses decisions about Hong Kong's Chief Executive and Legislative Council elections. 7.

"Moroccan Ambassador to China" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Moroccan ambassador in Beijing, which is likely the location where the ambassador of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra region to China would be based. It directly relates to the claim and is likely to contain the answer. 2. "Rabat" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about the capital city of Morocco and mentions that it is the capital of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region. However, it does not directly address the ambassador's location but gives background information that could be useful. 3. "Liaison Office (Hong Kong)" context: Although this context is about the Liaison Office in Hong Kong, it is less relevant because it does not mention the Moroccan ambassador or the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region.

Question:Are Yingkou and Fuding the same level of city?
golden idx: [7, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine if Yingkou and Fuding are the same level of city, we need to identify contexts that describe the administrative levels of these cities. 1. "Yingkou" context: This context directly mentions Yingkou as a prefecture-level city, which is crucial for comparing its level with Fuding. 2. "Fuding" context: Similarly, this context mentions Fuding as a county-level city, providing the necessary information to compare with Yingkou. 3. "Yingkou East Railway Station" context: While this context mentions Yingkou, it focuses on the railway station and not on the administrative level of the city. 4. "Fuding Railway Station" context: This context also focuses on the railway station in Fuding and does not provide information about the city's administrative level. 5. "Tongcheng Subdistrict, Fuding" context: This context mentions a subdistrict of Fuding, which could imply the city's administrative structure. 6. "Xiapu County" context: It borders Fuding City, which may suggest the relative administrative level of Fuding. 7. "Taimushan Railway Station" context: This context is about a railway station in Fuding and is less likely to contain information about the city's level. 8. "Yingkou Lanqi Airport" context: This context focuses on the airport in Yingkou and is less relevant to the city's administrative level. The remaining contexts are about specific locations within the cities or their infrastructure, which are less likely to contain information about the administrative levels of the cities.
idx: [9,7,1,2,6,0,4,5]

step-by-step think:1. "Yingkou" context: This context is highly relevant as it specifies Yingkou as a prefecture-level city, which is crucial to determining the city's administrative level in comparison to Fuding. 2. "Fuding" context: This context is equally important because it identifies Fuding as a county-level city, providing a direct comparison to Yingkou's administrative level. 3. "Xiapu County" context: While this context is less directly related to the claim, it provides geographical information about the region surrounding Fuding, which could offer additional context for understanding Fuding's administrative level.

Question:What year was the brother of this first round draft pick by the Washington Redskins drafted?
golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll focus on the relevance to the claim about the draft year of the brother of a first round draft pick by the Washington Redskins. 1. "Champ Bailey" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Champ Bailey, a first round draft pick by the Redskins, and his brother Boss Bailey. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Boss Bailey" context: This context is directly about Boss Bailey, the brother of Champ Bailey, and mentions his draft year. It is highly relevant and contains the answer. 3. "LaRon Landry" context: This context mentions a first round draft pick by the Redskins but is not related to the Baileys. It is less relevant to the claim. 4. "Jeris White" context: This context is about a player drafted by the Redskins but not in the first round and is not related to the Baileys. It is less relevant. 5. "Ron Snidow" context: This context is about a player drafted by the Redskins but not related to the Baileys. It is less relevant. 6. "Fred Hageman" context: This context is about a player drafted by the Redskins but not related to the Baileys. It is less relevant. 7. "Marc Parenteau" context: This context is about a CFL player and not directly relevant to the NFL draft claim. 8. "Robin Cole" context: This context is about a first round draft pick but not related to the Redskins or the Baileys. It is less relevant. 9. "Anthony Woodson" context: This context is about a CFL player and not relevant to the NFL draft claim. 10. "Tom Draper" context: This context is about an NHL player and not relevant to the NFL draft claim.
idx: [1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 7, 0, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the draft year of the brother of a first round draft pick by the Washington Redskins. 1. "Boss Bailey" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Boss Bailey, the brother of Champ Bailey, who was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the first round. It states that Boss Bailey was drafted in the second round of the 2003 NFL Draft, directly answering the claim. 2. "Champ Bailey" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Champ Bailey, who was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the first round, and identifies Boss Bailey as his brother. However, it does not state the year Boss Bailey was drafted. 3. "LaRon Landry" context: This context is about another player drafted by the Washington Redskins but is not relevant to the claim about the Baileys. The other contexts are about different players and do not pertain to the claim.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider their relevance to the claim about the American film actor and dancer who starred in the 1945 film "Johnny Angel". 
1. Context idx 3 ("Johnny Angel"): This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the film "Johnny Angel" and lists George Raft as the star, which answers the claim.

4. Context idx 5 ("Johnny Angel" song): Similar to idx 9, this context is relevant due to the title of the song, which shares the name with the film, but it's about the song, not the film.
5. Context idx 7 ("Johnny Lee Clary"): This context is less relevant as it mentions a person named Johnny Angel in a different context (wrestling), which is not related to the film.
6. Context idx 8 ("Johnny Angel Wendell"): This context is also less relevant because it refers to a person with the name Johnny Angel, but it does not relate to the film or acting.

Question:hree Men on a Horse is a play by a playwright born in which year ?
golden idx: [1, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the context that directly mentions the play "Three Men on a Horse" and provides information about its authors, as this is most likely to contain the answer to the claim. Context 8 is the most relevant because it directly mentions the play and its authors, George Abbott and John Cecil Holm. Next, I will look for contexts that mention George Abbott, as he is one of the authors of the play, which makes these contexts likely to contain the answer. Context 1 mentions George Abbott and his birth year, making it the second most relevant. The remaining contexts do not directly relate to the play or its authors, so they will be ranked based on the likelihood of containing information about playwrights and their birth years, which could indirectly help answer the claim. Contexts that mention playwrights and their birth years will be ranked higher than those that do not.
idx: [8, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the birth year of the playwright who wrote "Three Men on a Horse." To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the play and the likelihood of containing the answer about the playwright's birth year.
1. Context idx 1: This context is about George Abbott, who is one of the playwrights of "Three Men on a Horse." It provides his exact birth year, which directly answers the claim.
2. Context idx 8: This context is about the play "Three Men on a Horse" itself. While it does not provide the birth year, it is highly relevant because it mentions the play and one of its authors, George Abbott.
3. Context idx 0: This context is about Michael Wynne, a playwright, but not related to "Three Men on a Horse." However, it provides a birth year, which makes it somewhat relevant as an example of the kind of information we are looking for.
The other contexts are about different playwrights and do not mention "Three Men on a Horse" or George Abbott, making them less relevant to the claim.

Question:Who died first, George Archainbaud or Ralph Murphy?
golden idx: [0, 3]
step-by-step think: To determine who died first between George Archainbaud and Ralph Murphy, I will rank the contexts based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "George Archainbaud" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact death date of George Archainbaud, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. "Ralph Murphy" context: Similarly, this context is highly relevant because it gives the exact death date of Ralph Murphy, allowing us to compare the two dates. 3. "Arthur Roberts (editor)" context: This context mentions George Archainbaud and provides additional information about his career, which could be useful for verifying the claim, even though it does not directly answer the question. 4. "Criminal Lawyer" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a film directed by George Archainbaud, which could provide indirect evidence about his active years and possibly his death. 5. "Thrill of a Lifetime (film)" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions a film directed by George Archainbaud, but it does not provide information about his death. 6. "Hoppy Serves a Writ" context: This context is relevant in terms of providing information about George Archainbaud's work, but less so for the claim. 7. "Alias French Gertie" context: This context is similar to the previous ones, providing information about Archainbaud's work but not directly about his death. 8. "The Big Brain" context: This context is the least relevant of the contexts that mention George Archainbaud because it focuses on a specific film and provides no information about his death.
idx: [3, 0, 2, 7, 1, 4, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine who died first between George Archainbaud and Ralph Murphy, the contexts directly providing their death dates are most relevant. 1. "George Archainbaud" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact death date of George Archainbaud, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. "Ralph Murphy" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides the exact death date of Ralph Murphy, which is necessary to determine who died first. 3. "Arthur Roberts (editor)" context: Although this context mentions a different individual, Arthur Roberts, it is included because it provides a reference to George Archainbaud, which might be useful for cross-referencing information related to the claim. The other contexts are about films directed by George Archainbaud and do not provide direct information about the death dates of the individuals in question.

"Shellite (explosive)" context: This context is relevant because it discusses shellite and its components, which likely includes the one with the formula (ON)CHOH. 3. "Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride" context: This context is less relevant because the formula mentioned is different from the claim. 4. "1-Pentanol" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as the formula does not match the one in the claim. 5. "Xylitol" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as the formula does not match the one in the claim. 6. "Aldonic acid" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as the formula does not match the one in the claim. 7. "Isopropyl alcohol" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as the formula does not match the one in the claim. 8. "1-Hexanol" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as the formula does not match the one in the claim. 9. "Conductivity near the percolation threshold" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not discuss shellite or the formula in question. 10.

idx: [4, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Picric acid" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the formula (ON)CHOH, which is the focus of the claim. It provides detailed information about picric acid, its IUPAC name, and its uses, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Shellite (explosive)" context: This context is relevant because it describes shellite as a mixture that includes picric acid, which has the formula (ON)CHOH. It is likely to contain the answer since it connects shellite with the component in question. 3. "Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride" context: Although this context mentions a different chemical formula, it is somewhat relevant because it includes a similar formula structure with CHOH groups. However, it is less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts.

It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Roberto De Vicenzo" context: This context is about the individual who holds the record for the Argentine PGA Championship, mentioning his worldwide tournament wins, which is directly related to the claim. 3. "Middle Atlantic PGA Championship" context: While this context discusses a different PGA Championship, it mentions several players and their wins, which could be informative but is less directly relevant to the Argentine PGA Championship. 4.

"1940 PGA Championship" context: This context discusses another PGA Championship event and its winners, which is less relevant to the Argentine PGA Championship. 6. "2018 PGA Championship" context: This context talks about the PGA Championship in a general sense and its scheduling changes, which is not directly relevant to the claim. 7. "1939 PGA Championship" context: Similar to other PGA Championship contexts, it provides historical information but is not directly related to the Argentine PGA Championship. 8.

Question:Suicide's 1977 released album features a song based on what brand's comic character?
golden idx: [3, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a song from Suicide's 1977 album that is based on a comic character from a brand. Context 7 directly mentions "Ghost Rider," a song from Suicide's debut album, and states it is based on the Marvel Comics character, which is the answer to the claim. Context 3 mentions Suicide's debut album but does not provide information about the song in question, so it is relevant but less informative. Context 6 mentions a video game based on the comic character Garfield, which is relevant to the theme of comic characters but not directly related to the claim. Context 5 includes a mention of a "Doctor Who Magazine" comic character, which is somewhat relevant due to the comic character aspect but less likely to contain the answer. Context 1 mentions a film known for a comic character portrayal, which is tangentially relevant. Contexts 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9 do not mention comic characters or the band Suicide and are therefore not relevant to the claim.
idx: [7,3,6,5,1,0,2,4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Ghost Rider (Suicide song)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the song "Ghost Rider" by Suicide and states that it is based on the Marvel Comics character. It is informative and most likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Suicide (1977 album)" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about Suicide's debut album, which includes the song in question. However, it does not explicitly mention the comic character, making it slightly less relevant than the first context. 3. "A Week of Garfield" context: While this context mentions a comic character, Garfield, it is not related to the claim about Suicide's album or the song "Ghost Rider." It is less relevant and unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Context 4, "The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)," is the most relevant as it mentions Sarah Bolger and a New England setting with magical creatures. Context 2, "As Cool as I Am (film)," is also relevant because it stars Sarah Bolger, but it doesn't mention fantasy elements or magical creatures.

idx: [4, 9, 2, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a fantasy film starring Sarah Bolger, which involves a New England family discovering magical creatures around their estate. 
1. "The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the film by name, includes Sarah Bolger as part of the cast, and describes the plot that aligns perfectly with the claim. It is informative and almost certainly contains the answer to the claim.

3. "As Cool as I Am (film)" context: While this context mentions Sarah Bolger, the description of the film does not match the claim's details about magical creatures or a New England setting. It is less relevant than the first two contexts but still contains useful information about the actress's filmography.
The other contexts are less relevant as they either do not mention Sarah Bolger or the specific details of the claim.

Question:Maxeda has been owned since 2004 by which American multinational equity firm?
golden idx: [0, 4]
step-by-step think: The claim is about Maxeda being owned by an American multinational equity firm since 2004. The context from 'Maxeda' directly answers the claim, stating that it is owned by a consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts since 2004, making it the most relevant and informative. The 'Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' context is also highly relevant as it describes the firm and its specialization in private equity, which is directly related to the claim. The other contexts mention various private equity firms, but without direct reference to Maxeda or the timeframe since 2004, making them less relevant. Therefore, they are ranked based on the likelihood of the context containing information related to private equity firms and their activities, which might indirectly answer the claim or provide useful background information.

Context idx 1: Lincolnshire Management is another private equity firm, but it is not directly related to the claim. However, it is included because it is more relevant than the other contexts which do not mention Maxeda or related equity firms.

Question:Mummulgum is a stop on the Bruxner Highway before reaching the town on the banks of which river?
golden idx: [2, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine the relevance of each context to the claim, I will analyze the content of each paragraph and its relation to Mummulgum, the Bruxner Highway, and the river mentioned in the claim. The context that mentions Mummulgum and its geographical features, especially in relation to a river, will be ranked highest. Contexts that mention towns or features along the Bruxner Highway will also be relevant, but less so if they do not mention rivers. Contexts that are about areas not directly related to Mummulgum or do not mention rivers will be ranked lower.

1. Context idx 2: This context mentions Casino, which is a town on the banks of the Richmond River and is situated at the junction of the Bruxner Highway. Since Mummulgum is between Tenterfield and Casino, this context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 8: This context is about Mummulgum and mentions its location on the Bruxner Highway, but does not mention a river. It is relevant but less likely to contain the answer compared to context idx 2.
3. Context idx 4: This context mentions the Richmond Valley Council, which is named after the Richmond River and is adjacent to the Bruxner Highway. It is relevant and may contain the answer.
4. Context idx 9: This context mentions Tabulam, which is on the Bruxner Highway and on the Clarence River. It is relevant and may contain the answer.
5. Context idx 1: This context is about the Bruxner Highway itself, making it relevant but not specific to the claim's answer.
6. Context idx 0: This context mentions Alstonville, which is on the Bruxner Highway, but does not mention a river.
7. Context idx 5: This context mentions Wollongbar, which is on the Bruxner Highway, but does not mention a river.
8. Context idx 3: This context mentions Goonellabah, which is on the Bruxner Highway, but does not mention a river.

The remaining contexts (idx 6 and 7) are about Tenterfield and Bonshaw, which are less relevant as they do not mention Mummulgum or rivers.

idx: [2, 8, 4, 9, 1, 0, 5, 3]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 2: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Casino, which is a town on the banks of the Richmond River and is situated at the junction of the Bruxner Highway. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context is directly about Mummulgum, which is the subject of the claim. It provides location details and its relation to Casino, which is on the Richmond River. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 4: This context talks about the Richmond Valley Council, which is named after the Richmond River and is located adjacent to the Bruxner Highway. It is relevant and may contain the answer to the claim.

Question:Which American audio engineer and clandestine chemist, who was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement during the 1960s recorded the album "Old and in the Way?"
golden idx: [5, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about an American audio engineer and clandestine chemist who recorded the album "Old and in the Way." 1. Context idx 7: This context is directly relevant as it mentions the album "Old and in the Way" and states that it was recorded by Owsley Stanley, providing a clear connection to the claim. 2. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it provides detailed information about Owsley Stanley, his role in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement, and his work with the Grateful Dead, which is closely related to the claim. 3. Context idx 3: Gary Arlington was also a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area, but his work is more related to comics than audio engineering or the album in question. 4. Context idx 6: Jory Prum is mentioned as an audio engineer from the San Francisco Bay Area, which makes this context somewhat relevant. 5. Context idx 0: The Ragazzi Boys Chorus is associated with the San Francisco Bay Area and music but does not directly relate to the claim. 6. Context idx 1: The Key System provided mass transit in the San Francisco Bay Area but is unrelated to the claim about an audio engineer or the album. 7. Context idx 2: The Association of Bay Area Governments is related to the San Francisco Bay Area but does not provide information relevant to the claim. 8. Context idx 8: Oakland, California is a major city in the San Francisco Bay Area, but the context does not relate to the claim. 9. Context idx 9: The San Francisco Bay Area Water Trail is the least relevant as it focuses on recreational boating and not on the music or audio engineering scene.
idx: [7, 5, 3, 6, 0, 1, 2, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Owsley Stanley" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Owsley Stanley, who is directly related to the claim. It provides detailed information about his role as an audio engineer and chemist, his involvement in the hippie movement, and his connection with the Grateful Dead. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Old and in the Way (album)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses the album "Old and in the Way," which is the subject of the claim. It mentions that Owsley Stanley recorded the album, directly linking him to the claim. 3. "Gary Arlington" context: While this context is relevant to the San Francisco Bay Area and the counterculture movement, it does not mention Owsley Stanley or the album "Old and in the Way." It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts.

Question:When was the palace founded at which Columba de Dunbar died in 1435?
golden idx: [2, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify which contexts directly mention Spynie Palace, as this is the specific location where Columba de Dunbar died. Context 2 mentions the founding of the palace in the late 12th Century, which is highly relevant to the claim. Context 7 confirms Columba de Dunbar's death at Spynie Palace, adding to its relevance. Context 4, although it mentions a different Dunbar, is not relevant to the claim about the palace's founding. Contexts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 do not provide information about the founding of Spynie Palace or are less directly related to Columba de Dunbar's death there. Therefore, they are ranked lower.
idx: [2,7,4,1,3,5,6,8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Spynie Palace" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the founding of Spynie Palace, which is directly related to the claim. It provides a specific time frame for the founding of the palace, making it likely to contain the answer. 2. "Columba de Dunbar" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Columba de Dunbar's death at Spynie Palace, which is connected to the claim. However, it does not provide information about the founding of the palace. 3. "Bishop Dunbar's Hospital" context: Although this context is about a different Dunbar and a different building, it is included because it provides historical context about the era and the activities of the Bishops of Moray, which could be indirectly relevant to the claim.

Question:Where is the Bubblegum Alley, that is similar to Gum Wall, located in California?
golden idx: [5, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the location of Bubblegum Alley, similar to Gum Wall, in California. 1. "Bubblegum Alley" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions Bubblegum Alley and provides specific information about its location in San Luis Obispo, California. It is highly informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Gum Wall" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the Gum Wall, which is similar to Bubblegum Alley, and it also mentions the location of Bubblegum Alley in the text, making it likely to contain the answer. 3. "San Luis Obispo, California" context: This context is relevant as it talks about the city where Bubblegum Alley is located. It provides background information about the city, which could be useful for someone looking for Bubblegum Alley. 4. "Ouch! (gum)" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a brand of bubble gum, but it does not provide information about Bubblegum Alley's location. However, it is related to the topic of gum. 5. "Digital Media Factory" context: This context is related to the claim only because it mentions a location in California and involves the Wrigley Gum company, but it does not provide information about Bubblegum Alley. 6. "Hollywood Star Lanes" context: This context is about a location in California but is unrelated to Bubblegum Alley. 7. "Up Your Alley Fair" context: This context is about an event in California but does not provide information about Bubblegum Alley. 8. "Lower Louviers and Chicken Alley" context: This context is about a historic home and an alley in Delaware, which is not relevant to the claim about a location in California. 9. "Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame" context: This context is about a location in Philadelphia and is not relevant to the claim about a location in California. 10. "Old US 67 Rest Area" context: This context is about a rest area in Arkansas and is not relevant to the claim about a location in California.
idx: [9, 5, 7, 1, 8, 0, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Bubblegum Alley" context: This context is directly relevant to the claim as it provides detailed information about Bubblegum Alley's location in San Luis Obispo, California, and describes its characteristics. It is highly informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "San Luis Obispo, California" context: While this context does not directly mention Bubblegum Alley, it provides background information about the city of San Luis Obispo, where Bubblegum Alley is located. It is relevant and supports the information given in the top context. 3. "Gum Wall" context: This context mentions Bubblegum Alley in comparison to the Gum Wall in Seattle, indicating a similarity and reinforcing the relevance of Bubblegum Alley in San Luis Obispo, California. It is less directly related to the claim than the first two contexts but still provides useful comparative information.

Question:At what venue was the January 2, 2012 game featured the University of Louisville team?
golden idx: [1, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the venue of a specific game featuring the University of Louisville team on January 2, 2012. Context 1 (2013 Sugar Bowl) directly mentions a game featuring the Louisville Cardinals on January 2, 2013, which is the closest to the claim's date and involves the team in question, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 9 (2012 Louisville Cardinals football team) talks about the 2012 season of the Louisville Cardinals football team and their games, which makes it relevant and likely to contain information about the venue of the game in question. Context 7 (Parkway Field) mentions the University of Louisville team and provides historical information about their venues, which could be useful for the claim. Context 3 (2008 Fiesta Bowl) mentions a game on January 2, but in 2008, and involves a different team, making it less relevant. Contexts 0, 2, 4, and 5 mention other games or tournaments that took place in different years and do not involve the University of Louisville, making them less relevant. Context 6 (Dead or Alive 5 Plus) is about a video game and is not relevant to the claim. Context 8 (List of NBL Canada All-Stars) is about basketball all-stars and does not relate to the claim.
idx: [1, 9, 7, 3, 0, 2, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "2013 Sugar Bowl" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Louisville Cardinals playing in the Sugar Bowl on January 2, 2013, which is close to the claim's date. It specifies the venue as the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, making it very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "2012 Louisville Cardinals football team" context: This context is also relevant because it discusses the 2012 Louisville Cardinals football team and their participation in the Sugar Bowl where they defeated Florida. It is likely to contain the answer since it pertains to the same football season and mentions the Sugar Bowl, although it does not specify the date or venue. 3. "Parkway Field" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses the history of Parkway Field and its association with the University of Louisville team until 1998, which is well before the claim's date. It is informative about the team's history but unlikely to contain the answer to the claim about a game in 2012.

Question:Which film was Oscar nominated, LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton or Gimme Shelter, the 1970 Rolling Stones documentary?
golden idx: [2, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about Oscar nominations for the films "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" and "Gimme Shelter." 1. Context 2 directly states that "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 74th Academy Awards, which directly answers the claim. 2. Context 9 provides information about the "Gimme Shelter" documentary film, but does not mention an Oscar nomination, making it relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. Context 1 mentions the "Gimme Shelter" film in relation to another album, which is somewhat relevant but less direct. 4. Context 4 discusses the "Gimme Shelter" album, not the film, so it's less relevant. 5. Context 0 references the "Gimme Shelter" film but only in relation to another album, making it less relevant. 6. Context 6 mentions the song "Gimme Shelter," not the film, so it's less relevant. 7. Context 8 is a disambiguation page for "Gimme Shelter," which is less informative. 8. Context 7 discusses Keith Richards and the Rolling Stones, which is tangentially related but not directly answering the claim. The remaining contexts (3, 5) are even less relevant as they do not directly address the films in question or the Oscar nominations.
idx: [2, 9, 1, 4, 0, 6, 8, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking which film between "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" and "Gimme Shelter" was Oscar-nominated. 1. The context from "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" directly states that it was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 74th Academy Awards, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. The context from "Gimme Shelter (1970 film)" provides information about the film and its screening at the Cannes Film Festival, but does not mention an Oscar nomination, making it less relevant to the claim. 3. The context from "Merry Clayton" mentions an Oscar-winning documentary, but it is "20 Feet from Stardom," not "Gimme Shelter," making it informative but not directly answering the claim. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention Oscar nominations or are related to different aspects of the Rolling Stones and their music.

Question:Which board game was published most recently, Pirate's Cove or Catan?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: To determine which board game was published most recently, Pirate's Cove or Catan, we need to identify the context that provides the publication date for each game. The context for "Pirate's Cove" indicates it was originally published in 2002. The contexts related to "Catan" show various publication dates; however, the most recent one is for "The Rivals for Catan," published in 2010. Therefore, "The Rivals for Catan" is the most recent publication mentioned among the contexts. The other contexts provide information about different versions and expansions of the Catan series, but none mention a more recent publication date than 2010. Hence, they are ranked based on their relevance to the main Catan game and their publication dates.

1. "The Rivals for Catan" context: This is the most relevant context as it mentions the most recent publication date (2010) among the Catan series, which is later than the publication date of Pirate's Cove.
2. "Pirate's Cove" context: This context is highly relevant because it provides the publication date for Pirate's Cove (2002), which is necessary for comparison.
3. "Catan Dice Game" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a publication date (2007), which is more recent than the original Catan but not as recent as "The Rivals for Catan."
4. "Catan Histories: Struggle for Rome" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it provides a publication date (2006) for a game in the Catan series.
5. "Catan" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the original game, which is the basis for all other contexts.
6. "Catan: Cities & Knights" context: This context is relevant as it discusses an expansion of Catan, which could be important for understanding the series' development.
7. "Catan Card Game" context: This context is relevant as it discusses a card game adaptation of Catan, providing background on the series.
8. "Catan: Seafarers" context: This context is relevant as it discusses another expansion of Catan, adding to the overall understanding of the series.

idx: [6, 5, 2, 7, 3, 1, 0, 8]

step-by-step think: To determine which board game was published most recently, Pirate's Cove or Catan, I will evaluate the contexts based on the publication dates mentioned within them. 1. "Pirate's Cove" context: This context provides the publication date of Pirate's Cove as originally published in 2002 and republished in 2003. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "The Rivals for Catan" context: This context mentions that The Rivals for Catan was released in 2010, which is an updated revision of the Catan Card Game. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Catan Dice Game" context: This context states that the Catan Dice Game was published in 2007, which is more recent than Pirate's Cove but not as recent as The Rivals for Catan. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. The other contexts mention games published earlier than 2002 or are expansions of the original Catan game, which was first published in 1995.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider their relevance to the claim about Alice David being the voice of Lara Croft and the company that developed the game. 1. Context 6 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Alice David and her role as the voice of Lara Croft in the video game "Tomb Raider". 2. Context 0 is highly relevant because it discusses the "Tomb Raider" video game developed by Crystal Dynamics, which is likely the game in question. 3. Context 1 provides extensive information about the "Tomb Raider" media franchise, including the games and their development history, which is useful for the claim. 4. Context 7 gives a broad overview of the "Tomb Raider" franchise and its ownership, which includes the development company. 5. Context 5 details Lara Croft as a character within the franchise, which is indirectly related to the claim. 6. Context 2 talks about a specific "Tomb Raider" game developed by Crystal Dynamics, adding to the relevance. 7. Context 8 discusses another game in the series, which could be informative regarding the development company. 8. Context 3, while about the "Tomb Raider" series, is less directly related to the claim compared to the others.
idx: [6,0,1,7,5,2,8,3]

step-by-step think: To determine the top 3 ranked contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context idx 0: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Tomb Raider" being developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix, directly answering the claim about the company that developed the game for which Alice David voiced Lara Croft. 2. Context idx 6: This context is relevant because it confirms Alice David as the voice of Lara Croft in the French dub of the game "Tomb Raider," which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not mention the developer, making it slightly less relevant than idx 0. 3. Context idx 1: This context provides extensive background information on the "Tomb Raider" media franchise, including the developers and publishers throughout its history, which is informative and likely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:Which Eminem album included vocals from a singer who had an album titled "Unapologetic"?
golden idx: [2, 4]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for an Eminem album that includes vocals from a singer who had an album titled "Unapologetic". Rihanna is the singer of the album "Unapologetic". Therefore, the context that mentions a collaboration between Eminem and Rihanna would be most relevant. Context 2, "The Monster (song)", directly mentions the song "The Monster" from Eminem's album "The Marshall Mathers LP 2", which features Rihanna, making it the most relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 4, "Numb (Rihanna song)", is also highly relevant as it mentions the collaboration between Eminem and Rihanna on the song "Numb" from Rihanna's album "Unapologetic". Context 0, "Encore (Eminem song)", mentions an Eminem album but does not mention Rihanna or "Unapologetic", so it is less relevant. Context 3, "Rabid Neurosis", mentions the leak of an Eminem album but is not directly related to the claim. Contexts 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not mention Eminem or Rihanna and are therefore not relevant to the claim.
idx: [2, 4, 0, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 2: "The Monster (song)" context is highly relevant as it mentions the collaboration between Eminem and Rihanna, and specifically names the album "The Marshall Mathers LP 2" which includes the song "The Monster" featuring Rihanna. Since Rihanna's album "Unapologetic" is mentioned in the claim, this context is likely to contain the answer. 2. Context idx 4: "Numb (Rihanna song)" context is relevant because it mentions Rihanna's album "Unapologetic" and her collaboration with Eminem, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not mention the specific Eminem album, making it slightly less relevant than context idx 2. 3. Context idx 0: "Encore (Eminem song)" context mentions an Eminem album titled "Encore," but it does not mention Rihanna or her album "Unapologetic," making it less relevant to the claim than the previous contexts.

"Jillian Bell" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Jillian Bell's role in Workaholics, directly answering the claim. 2. "SuperMansion" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the series SuperMansion, but does not directly answer the claim about the actress's role in Workaholics. 3. "Jenna Dewan" context: This context mentions Jenna Dewan's various roles, but does not mention Workaholics, making it less relevant to the claim. 4. "Jeff Hephner" context: This context is informative about Jeff Hephner's career but is not relevant to the claim about the actress from SuperMansion and Workaholics. 5. "Mitch Pileggi" context: This context provides information on Mitch Pileggi's roles, but again, it does not relate to the claim. 6. "John Amos" context: This context details John Amos's career but does not mention Workaholics or SuperMansion. 7.

"John Pappas" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention either SuperMansion or Workaholics. 9. "Jo Marie Payton" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention the actress's role in Workaholics. 10. "Hilarie Burton" context: This context is informative about Hilarie Burton's career but does not address the claim.

step-by-step think:1. "Jillian Bell" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Jillian Bell and her role in "Workaholics," which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "SuperMansion" context: This context is also highly relevant because it lists Jillian Bell as a cast member of "SuperMansion," connecting her to both the show and her role in "Workaholics." It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Jenna Dewan" context: While this context mentions an actress with a recurring role in a series, it does not relate to "Workaholics" or "SuperMansion," making it less relevant. However, it is still more relevant than other contexts that do not mention television roles at all.

Therefore, the most relevant context will be the one that directly mentions the 1974 team and provides information about the university they represented. 

1. Context idx 5 is the most relevant as it directly addresses the 1974 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and mentions that they represented Texas Tech University.
2. Context idx 9 is the second most relevant because it provides detailed information about Texas Tech University, which is the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 6 is relevant as it discusses the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team, but from a different year (1986). It is less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim but still provides context about the football team's history.
4. Context idx 8 provides historical context about the Texas Tech football team's rivalry, which is informative but less directly related to the 1974 team.
5. Context idx 7 discusses the 2009 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and their achievements, which is informative but not directly relevant to the 1974 team.
6. Context idx 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all about different years of the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and their seasons. They are informative about the team's history but do not directly answer the claim about the 1974 team.

Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the 1974 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and states that they represented Texas Tech University. It provides specific details about the team's season, leaders, and home games, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: To determine the best singles ranking between Roberta Vinci and Jorge Lozano, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Roberta Vinci" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides detailed information about Roberta Vinci's career, including her highest singles ranking of World No. 7. 2. "Jorge Lozano" context: This context is equally relevant because it mentions Jorge Lozano's highest singles ranking of World No. 51. 3. "2015 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles" context: This context mentions Roberta Vinci and provides information related to her career, but it is less directly related to the singles ranking claim. 4. "2011 Barcelona Ladies Open – Doubles" context: This context mentions Roberta Vinci but does not provide information about her singles ranking. 5. "2015 Rogers Cup – Women's Doubles" context: Similar to the previous context, it mentions Vinci but not her singles ranking. 6. "Marta Domachowska" context: This context mentions Roberta Vinci in the context of doubles, which is less relevant to the singles ranking claim. 7. "1988 Volvo International – Doubles" context: This context is about Jorge Lozano's doubles performance, which is not directly relevant to the singles ranking claim. 8. "1994 Athens International – Doubles" context: This context mentions Jorge Lozano but is about doubles performance, making it less relevant to the singles ranking claim.
idx: [2, 0, 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, 7]

step-by-step think: To determine the best singles ranking between Roberta Vinci and Jorge Lozano, we need to compare their highest singles rankings as stated in the contexts. 1. "Roberta Vinci" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Roberta Vinci's highest singles ranking of World No. 7, which directly answers the claim. 2. "Jorge Lozano" context: This context is also highly relevant as it provides Jorge Lozano's highest singles ranking of World No. 51, which is necessary to answer the claim. 3. "Marta Domachowska" context: While this context mentions Roberta Vinci, it is less relevant because it does not provide information about Vinci's singles ranking but rather her partnership with Domachowska in doubles. The other contexts are not relevant to the singles rankings of the players in question.

Question:Both Truth in Science and Discovery embrace what campaign?
golden idx: [6, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify which contexts mention both "Truth in Science" and "Discovery" as these are key to the claim. Contexts that mention campaigns related to these organizations will be ranked higher. 1. Context 6: This context mentions "Truth in Science" and its promotion of the "Teach the Controversy" campaign, which is also associated with the Discovery Institute. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context 8: This context talks about the Discovery Institute and its "Teach the Controversy" campaign. It is directly relevant to the claim and likely contains the answer. 3. Context 7: The "Truth Initiative" is mentioned, which could be confused with "Truth in Science," but it is about tobacco control, not the campaign in question. However, it is somewhat relevant. 4. Context 5: The "Truth" anti-tobacco campaign is mentioned, which is not directly related to the claim but shares a keyword with "Truth in Science." 5. Context 0: The Discovery Museum and Planetarium is related to the Discovery aspect of the claim but does not mention any campaign. 6. Context 2: Discovery Networks Benelux is part of Discovery Networks International, which could be related to the Discovery aspect of the claim. 7. Context 1: Extrema (band) has no direct relevance to the claim but mentions a song title with the word "Truth." 8. Context 4: "The Last Embrace" is the least relevant as it does not mention either "Truth in Science" or "Discovery" or any related campaign. Contexts 3 and 9 are not included in the top 8 as they do not mention any keywords or related campaigns.
idx: [6, 8, 7, 5, 0, 2, 1, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "Truth in Science" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the "Teach the Controversy" campaign and its association with both Truth in Science and the Discovery Institute. It provides detailed information about the campaign and the organizations' efforts to promote it, making it very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Discovery Institute" context: This context is also directly relevant to the claim as it describes the Discovery Institute's involvement with the "Teach the Controversy" campaign. It offers insight into the institute's goals and strategies, which are closely related to the claim. 3. "Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)" context: Although this context is about a different "Truth" campaign, it is less relevant to the claim about the "Teach the Controversy" campaign embraced by Truth in Science and Discovery. However, it is included as the third context because it shares the keyword "Truth" and might be mistakenly associated with the claim due to the name similarity.

"Ian Watkins (Lostprophets)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the claim by providing detailed information about Ian Watkins' incarceration and its impact on his career with the rock band Lostprophets. It is informative and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Lostprophets" context: This context is relevant because it provides background information about the band associated with Ian Watkins. While it does not directly mention his incarceration, it is related to the claim and provides context about the band's formation and members. 3. "We Bring an Arsenal" context: This context mentions the impact of Watkins' imprisonment on the band's activities, specifically the release of a single, which makes it relevant to the claim.

Question:The movies Queen of Blood and Battle Beyond the Sun both contained scenes from what 1959 Soviet feature?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim regarding the 1959 Soviet feature that both "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun" used scenes from. Contexts that mention these movies or the year 1959 will be ranked higher. 

1. Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Nebo Zovyot", the 1959 Soviet science fiction film which is the answer to the claim. It also details the English-dubbed version "Battle Beyond the Sun".
2. Context idx 6: This context is relevant because it mentions "Queen of Blood" and states that it reused footage from "Nebo Zovyot".
3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a 1959 Soviet film, which makes it potentially relevant, but it does not mention the specific films in question.
4. Context idx 7: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions a 1959 Soviet science fiction film, but it does not directly relate to the films in the claim.
5. Context idx 0: This context is less relevant as it mentions a Soviet film shot in 1966, not 1959.
6. Context idx 2: This context is less relevant as it discusses a Soviet TV miniseries and the war in Afghanistan.
7. Context idx 5: This context is less relevant as it mentions a Soviet film shot in 1987.
8. Context idx 8: This context is less relevant as it mentions a 1961 Soviet animated film.
9. Context idx 1: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses an American film from 1980.
10. Context idx 9: This context is not relevant as it discusses a 1952 Soviet animated film.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the top 8 ranked contexts are:

idx: [3, 6, 4, 7, 0, 2, 5, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Queen of Blood" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that "Queen of Blood" reused special effects footage from the Soviet features "Mechte Navstrechu" and "Nebo Zovyot," directly linking to the 1959 Soviet feature in question. 2. "Battle Beyond the Sun" context: This context is also highly relevant because it identifies "Nebo Zovyot" as the original Soviet film that "Battle Beyond the Sun" is based on, which is likely the answer to the claim. 3. "I Was a Satellite of the Sun" context: While this context mentions a 1959 Soviet feature film, it does not seem to be directly related to the claim about "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun," but it is still a 1959 Soviet film which might cause confusion. 4. "Girl Seeks Father" context: This context is about a different 1959 Soviet film and does not appear to be directly related to the claim. 5. Other contexts: The remaining contexts are about different films or topics and do not mention the films in question or the year 1959, making them less relevant.

golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the name of the Isles led by Aonghus Mór, which covered a total land area of over 8300 km2. To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to Aonghus Mór, the mention of the land area, and the historical period mentioned in the claim.

1. "Kingdom of the Isles" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Kingdom of the Isles, which Aonghus Mór was a part of, and specifies the land area as over 8300 km2, directly matching the claim.
2. "List of rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses the rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles, which includes Aonghus Mór, and mentions the same land area as the claim.
3. "Aonghus Mór" context: This context is relevant as it provides detailed information about Aonghus Mór himself, although it does not directly mention the land area.
4. "Lord of Islay" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Aonghus Mór and the title associated with the region he led, but it does not specify the land area.
5. "Geography of the Philippines" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses the Philippines, which is unrelated to Aonghus Mór or the Isles in question.
6. "List of islands of Tasmania" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses Tasmania, which is unrelated to Aonghus Mór or the Isles in question.
7. "Protected areas of Himachal Pradesh" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses Himachal Pradesh, which is unrelated to Aonghus Mór or the Isles in question.
8. "National parks of Taiwan" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses Taiwan, which is unrelated to Aonghus Mór or the Isles in question.
9. "Jaluit Atoll" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses the Jaluit Atoll, which is unrelated to Aonghus Mór or the Isles in question.
10. "Ashanti Region" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses the Ashanti Region in Ghana, which is unrelated to Aonghus Mór or the Isles in question.

Based on the above considerations, the contexts are ranked by their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

idx: [2, 7, 0, 8, 1, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Kingdom of the Isles" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Kingdom of the Isles, which Aonghus Mór was associated with, and notes the total land area, directly matching the claim's details. 2. "Aonghus Mór" context: This context is directly about Aonghus Mór and provides information on his role and lineage, which is crucial to answering the claim. 3. "Lord of Islay" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the title associated with Aonghus Mór and the territory he was connected with. It is less directly related to the claim than the first two but still contains valuable information. 4. "List of rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles" context: While this context is informative about the rulers, it does not specifically mention Aonghus Mór or the land area, making it less relevant than the others. 5.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, the informativeness of the context, and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim asks for the third single from Alan Jackson's album "A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love)" that was behind for two weeks on the country charts.

2. Context idx 6: This context provides information about the album itself, including all singles released from it. It is very informative and relevant.
3. Context idx 0: This context discusses the first single from the album, which is relevant but not the third single.

idx: [8, 6, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the song that was behind the third single from Alan Jackson's album "A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love)" on the country charts for two weeks. 1. Context idx 8: "Chattahoochee (song)" is highly relevant as it mentions that "Chattahoochee" was released as the third single from the album and provides specific details about its release and its relation to the album. 2. Context idx 9: "We'll Burn That Bridge" is relevant because it mentions that the song "We'll Burn That Bridge" was at number 2 on the country charts, behind "Chattahoochee" by Alan Jackson. This context is informative as it gives us the chart position of "Chattahoochee," indirectly confirming its significance. 3. Context idx 6: "A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love)" is relevant as it lists all the singles from the album and mentions that "Chattahoochee" was a Number One hit, which is likely to be the answer to the claim.

Context idx 2: This context is about the United States presidential election of 2016, which is the 58th quadrennial American presidential election and follows the 2016 Michigan Democratic primary. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context discusses the United States presidential election of 2020, which is the next election after the 2016 one. It is relevant as it follows the election in question but is not the direct answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 3: This context is about the Michigan Democratic primary of 2016, which is directly related to the claim but does not discuss the subsequent presidential election. It is informative regarding the primary but less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that discuss the presidential elections.

Question:This Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 ruled southeastern Britain prior to conquest by which empire?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about a Celtic ruler born in AD 43 who ruled southeastern Britain prior to the Roman conquest. 1. "Togodumnus" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Togodumnus, a king of the Catuvellauni tribe during the Roman conquest, aligning closely with the claim. 2. "Catuvellauni" context: This context is directly related to the tribe of the ruler in question and provides background on the Celtic tribe in southeastern Britain. 3. "Roman conquest of Britain" context: This context discusses the Roman conquest beginning in AD 43, which is directly related to the claim. 4. "Romano-British culture" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire after the conquest in AD 43. 5. "Corieltauvi" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions a tribe living in Britain prior to the Roman conquest, but it's less directly related to the ruler in question. 6. "AD 43" context: This context provides information about the year AD 43 but lacks direct relevance to the ruler's identity or actions. 7. "History of England" context: This context is relevant to the broader historical setting of the claim but does not directly address the ruler or the conquest. 8. "Durotriges" context: This context mentions another Celtic tribe and their situation post-Roman conquest, which is tangentially related to the claim.

Question:This singer of A Rather Blustery Day also voiced what hedgehog?
golden idx: [4, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" who also voiced a hedgehog. 1. Context idx 9 mentions "A Rather Blustery Day" and identifies Jim Cummings as the singer for Pooh. This context is highly relevant as it directly connects to the song mentioned in the claim. 2. Context idx 4 mentions Jim Cummings and lists his roles, including voicing the character Dr. Robotnik from "Sonic the Hedgehog". This context is highly relevant as it provides the answer to the second part of the claim about the hedgehog. 3. Context idx 7 is about "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" but does not mention the singer or the hedgehog, making it less relevant than idx 9 and 4. 4. Context idx 3 mentions the song "Heffalumps and Woozles" from the same featurette but does not provide information about the singer or the hedgehog. 5.

golden idx: [2, 9]
step-by-step think:1. "Siri Remote" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Siri Remote, which is a successor to the original Apple Remote and is designed to work with the Apple TV, which the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with. It is informative and directly addresses the claim by providing an alternative device that can control the program. 2. "Front Row (software)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses the Front Row software, which was controlled by the Apple Remote. It provides historical context and information about the software's reliance on the Apple Remote, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Apple Watch" context: While this context is about an Apple product, it does not directly address the claim about controlling the program the Apple Remote was designed for. However, it mentions the integration with iOS and other Apple products, which could imply some level of control or interaction. 4. "Universal remote" context: This context is relevant as it discusses universal remotes, which are capable of being programmed to control various devices, potentially including the program the Apple Remote was designed for. It is informative but less directly related to the claim than the Siri Remote or Front Row contexts. 5. "Remote control" context: This context provides general information about remote controls, which is related to the claim but does not specifically mention the Apple Remote or the program it controls. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts that directly mention the devices in question.

Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments and the number of people in each act. 1. "Wolf Alice" context: This context is relevant as it mentions that Wolf Alice is a four-piece band, which gives us the number of people in the act. However, it does not provide information about the number of instruments they use. 2. "Badly Drawn Boy" context: This context is highly relevant because it describes Badly Drawn Boy as a multi-instrumentalist, which suggests a high instrument to person ratio. It also provides background information on Damon Gough, the person behind Badly Drawn Boy. 3. "The Hour of Bewilderbeast" context: This context is informative as it mentions that Damon Gough wrote, produced, and played several instruments on the album's tracks, which supports the idea of a high instrument to person ratio for Badly Drawn Boy. 4. Other contexts: The remaining contexts provide additional information about Badly Drawn Boy's music and career but do not directly address the instrument to person ratio. Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the "Badly Drawn Boy" and "The Hour of Bewilderbeast" contexts score the highest.

Question:A Japanese manga series based on a 16 year old high school student Ichitaka Seto, is written and illustrated by someone born in what year?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: 

1. "My Bride is a Mermaid" context: This context directly mentions a Japanese manga series, which is related to the claim. It provides information about the author of the manga, Tahiko Kimura, but it doesn't provide the exact birth year. However, since it directly relates to the claim, it is relevant and likely contains information that can help answer the claim.

2. "I"s" context: This context directly mentions a Japanese manga series called "I"s." It provides information about the main character, Ichitaka Seto, who is a 16-year-old high school student. It is likely that this context contains the answer to the claim since it directly relates to it and mentions the character's age.

Question:The battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi lost his life secured what for Ethiopia?
golden idx: [0, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi died and what it secured for Ethiopia. 1. "Battle of Adwa" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions the Battle of Adwa, where Giuseppe Arimondi died, and states that this battle secured Ethiopian sovereignty. It is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Giuseppe Arimondi" context: This context provides information about Giuseppe Arimondi, including his death at Adwa, which is relevant to the claim. However, it does not explicitly state what the battle secured for Ethiopia, making it slightly less relevant than the "Battle of Adwa" context. 3. "First Italo-Ethiopian War" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the war during which the Battle of Adwa took place. It provides background information that could be useful for understanding the claim but is less directly related to the specific battle and its outcome for Ethiopia. 4. "Treaty of Addis Ababa" context: This context is informative as it discusses the treaty that ended the First Italo-Ethiopian War and mentions the Battle of Adwa. It is relevant because it deals with the aftermath of the battle and the recognition of Ethiopian independence. 5. "Outline of Ethiopia" context: This context provides a broad overview of Ethiopian history, including the Battle of Adwa. It is less specific to the claim but still relevant. The remaining contexts are less directly related to the claim and are therefore ranked lower.

It also specifies that he served under New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, providing a clear answer to the claim. 2.

It is likely to contain additional information that could be pertinent to the claim. 3. "Executive Order 10925" context: While this context discusses affirmative action and a committee related to employment opportunities, it does not directly mention Alfred Balk or the specific committee in question, making it less relevant. 4. "Cynthia Hogan" context: This context mentions Joe Biden as Vice President, which could be misleading because it does not pertain to the claim about Alfred Balk. 5.

golden idx: [5, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a coastal area that borders the south side of a medieval fortress in Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland. 1. Context idx 5 ('Yellowcraigs'): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Yellowcraig, a coastal area that borders Dirleton to the south, which is likely the answer to the claim. It is informative and directly addresses the geographical relationship between Dirleton and the coastal area. 2. Context idx 3 ('Dirleton'): This context is relevant because it describes the location of Dirleton and its surrounding areas, including the Firth of Forth to the north, which could help infer the coastal area to the south. However, it does not explicitly mention the coastal area in question, making it slightly less relevant than idx 5. 3. Context idx 9 ('Dirleton Castle'): This context provides information about Dirleton Castle's location in relation to other areas, but it does not specify the coastal area to the south, making it less relevant than idx 5 and 3. 4.

The remaining contexts (idx 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) are not directly relevant to the claim as they do not provide information about the coastal area bordering Dirleton to the south.

It also provides information about the first track and the artist involved, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

It provides details about the song's writer, Phil Spector, and its history, which is likely to contain the answer. 3. "Mono Masters" context: While this context mentions a mono box set, it does not seem to be directly related to the "Back to Mono" box set or the song in question, making it less likely to contain the answer. 4. "The Doors: Vinyl Box Set" context: This context is about a different artist and box set, making it less relevant to the claim. 5.

Question:Are Ferocactus and Silene both types of plant?
golden idx: [1, 4]
step-by-step think: The claim asks whether Ferocactus and Silene are both types of plants. To rank the contexts, I need to find the ones that confirm the plant status of both Ferocactus and Silene.
1. Context idx 4 ("Ferocactus"): This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Ferocactus is a genus of cacti, which are plants. It directly answers half of the claim regarding Ferocactus.
2. Context idx 1 ("Silene"): This context is also highly relevant because it confirms that Silene is a genus of flowering plants, directly answering the other half of the claim regarding Silene.
3. Context idx 0 ("Silene menziesii"): While this context provides detailed information about a species within the Silene genus, it is less directly relevant to the claim than the context that describes the Silene genus as a whole.
4. Context idx 2 ("Silene conoidea"): Similar to idx 0, this context provides information about a specific species within the Silene genus and is informative but less directly relevant than the context about the genus itself.
5. Other contexts (idx 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9): These contexts provide information about specific species within the Silene genus or details about the genus' characteristics, such as sex determination. However, they are less relevant to the claim than the contexts that directly confirm the plant status of both Ferocactus and Silene.

Based on the relevance and directness in answering the claim, the top two contexts are idx 4 and idx 1.

1. Context idx 1 ("Kirton End"): This context is directly about Kirton End, providing its location and proximity to other places. However, it does not contain the population data for the city it is located in, only for Kirton End itself.
2. Context idx 4 ("Boston, Lincolnshire"): This context mentions Boston, which is 4 mi south-west from Kirton End as per context idx 1. It provides the population of the town of Boston according to the 2001 census, which is likely the answer to the claim since Kirton End is a hamlet within the Boston district.
3. Context idx 9 ("Kirton, Nottinghamshire"): This context is about a different Kirton, located in Nottinghamshire, and provides population data from the 2001 census. It is not relevant to Kirton End in the Boston district of Lincolnshire.

Question:What is the name of the executive producer of the film that has a score composed by Jerry Goldsmith?
golden idx: [1, 9]
step-by-step think: To find the executive producer of a film scored by Jerry Goldsmith, I need to identify contexts that mention both a film and its executive producer. Context 1 mentions the film "Alien" and names Shusett as the executive producer, which is directly relevant to the claim. Context 5 mentions the film "Lionheart" and names Francis Ford Coppola and Jack Schwartzman as executive producers, which also directly addresses the claim. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the executive producer role. The other contexts mention films scored by Jerry Goldsmith but do not provide information about the executive producers, making them less relevant for this specific claim.

"Emma Bull" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the specific birth date of Emma Bull, which is essential to answer the claim. 2.

Question:What was the Roud Folk Song Index of the nursery rhyme inspiring What Are Little Girls Made Of?
golden idx: [0, 1]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the Roud Folk Song Index of the nursery rhyme that inspired "What Are Little Girls Made Of?".

Context with idx 0: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "What Are Little Boys Made Of?" and provides the Roud Folk Song Index number of 821, which is likely the answer to the claim. 2. Context with idx 1: This context is relevant because it mentions the title of the episode that was inspired by the nursery rhyme, indicating a connection to the claim.

Question:Were the bands Skin Yard and Ostava from the U.S.?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim asks whether the bands Skin Yard and Ostava are from the U.S. To rank the contexts, I will look for information that directly addresses the origin of these bands. 1.

Several contexts mention Skin Yard, but context idx 6 titled 'Skin Yard' directly states that Skin Yard was an American grunge band from Seattle, Washington, which directly answers the other half of the claim regarding Skin Yard's origin. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the claim.

Question:Which song was behind the third single on the album  "A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love)" for two weeks on the country charts?
golden idx: [8, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for the third single from Alan Jackson's album "A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love)" that stayed for two weeks on the country charts. To find the most relevant contexts, I will look for mentions of the singles from the album and their chart positions.
1. Context idx 6: This context mentions the album and lists all the singles from it, including "Chattahoochee", "She's Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)", "Tonight I Climbed the Wall", "(Who Says) You Can't Have It All" and "Mercury Blues". It states that "Chattahoochee" and "She's Got the Rhythm" were both Number One hits, which means they are not the third single. However, it does not specify the order of the singles or their time on the charts.
2. Context idx 8: This context specifically mentions "Chattahoochee" as the third single from the album and states that it was released in May 1993. It also notes that the album is named after a line in this song, which makes it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 0 and idx 5: Both these contexts mention singles from the album, but neither specifies their order of release or their duration on the charts.
4. Context idx 1: This context mentions "(Who Says) You Can't Have It All" as the fifth and final single, which means it cannot be the third single.
5. The other contexts are about different albums, songs, or artists and do not provide information about the singles from Alan Jackson's album in question.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the top two contexts are idx 8 and idx 6.

golden idx: [2, 4]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the name of the detective novelist parent of the author of '"Q" Is for Quarry'. To find the most relevant contexts, I will look for contexts that mention the author of '"Q" Is for Quarry' and any reference to their parents who are also detective novelists.

4. The remaining contexts do not mention Sue Grafton or '"Q" Is for Quarry' and are therefore not relevant to the claim.

step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts, I will consider the claim's focus on the "Captain of the National Hockey League All-Star Game 'Away Team'" and his position. Contexts that mention specific All-Star Games, team captains, and their positions will be most relevant.
1. Context idx 1 ("Jonathan Toews"): This context mentions Jonathan Toews, a professional ice hockey centre who serves as captain of the Chicago Blackhawks. It is relevant because it discusses a player's position and captaincy, although not specifically related to the All-Star Game.
2. Context idx 8 ("60th National Hockey League All-Star Game"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions the All-Star Game, team captains, and their roles. It specifically states that Jonathan Toews served as captain for the away team, which directly answers the claim.
3. Context idx 0 ("National Hockey League All-Star Game"): This context provides general information about the NHL All-Star Game but does not mention specific positions or captains.
4. Context idx 5 ("57th National Hockey League All-Star Game"): Similar to context idx 0, it provides details on an All-Star Game but lacks specific information about the captain's position.
5. The remaining contexts (idx 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9) are less relevant as they do not directly address the claim about the All-Star Game captain's position or do not pertain to the All-Star Game at all.

Based on relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the top two contexts are:

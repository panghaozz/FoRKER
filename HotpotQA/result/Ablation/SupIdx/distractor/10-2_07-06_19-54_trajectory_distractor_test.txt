Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: To determine the instrument to person ratio for Badly Drawn Boy and Wolf Alice, we need to consider the number of instruments played compared to the number of people in each act. 1. "Badly Drawn Boy" context: This context mentions that Badly Drawn Boy is a stage name for Damon Gough, an indie singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. This suggests he likely plays multiple instruments, which could mean a high instrument to person ratio. 2. "Wolf Alice" context: This context states that Wolf Alice is a four-piece band, which implies there are at least four instruments involved. However, without specific information on the number of instruments, we cannot determine the exact ratio. 3. "The Hour of Bewilderbeast" context: This context provides information on the debut album of Badly Drawn Boy, where Damon Gough wrote, produced, and played several instruments. This supports the idea that Badly Drawn Boy has a high instrument to person ratio.

Question:Who was the writer of These Boots Are Made for Walkin' and who died in 2007?
golden idx: [2, 4]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to identify the writer of "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" and the individual who died in 2007. Context 4 mentions Lee Hazlewood as the producer of Nancy Sinatra's album, which includes the song, but does not mention his death. Context 2 confirms Lee Hazlewood wrote the song and was recorded by Nancy Sinatra. Context 4 provides additional information about the album and its significance. However, it is context 4 that provides the crucial information that Lee Hazlewood passed away in 2007, making it the most relevant and informative. Therefore, the ranking is as follows: 1. Context 4, as it confirms Lee Hazlewood's role and his death in 2007. 2. Context 2, as it establishes the connection between the song and Lee Hazlewood. 3. Context 3, as it provides additional details about the song's success, which is relevant but less critical to the claim.

Question:Which British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II?
golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about the British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, I will evaluate the contexts based on their relevance to the claim, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer. 

1. Context idx 5: "English Electric Canberra" context is directly relevant as it mentions a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim since it details the aircraft's development and service introduction, which aligns with the timeframe of World War II.

It provides background information on the area and the Allied powers involved, which is useful but does not specifically mention the bomber in question.

3. Context idx 3: "No. 12 Squadron RAAF" context is somewhat relevant because it mentions a squadron that operated in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. It details the squadron's activities and the types of operations it was involved in, which could potentially include the use of the bomber in question.

The other contexts are less relevant as they either mention different aircraft, different theatres of operation, or individuals not directly related to the claim.

golden idx: [8, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine the top 3 ranked contexts, I will evaluate each context based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim asks for the song that was the third single on Alan Jackson's album "A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love)" and remained for two weeks on the country charts.

1. Context idx 8: This context is about the song "Chattahoochee," which is mentioned as the third single from the album in question. It directly relates to the claim and is likely to contain the answer since it discusses the release and chart performance of the song.

"Roman conquest of Britain" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the Roman conquest beginning in AD 43, which directly relates to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer since it pertains to the Roman Empire's activities in Britain. 2. "Togodumnus" context: This context mentions a specific ruler, Togodumnus, who died in AD 43 and was a king of the Catuvellauni tribe at the time of the Roman conquest. This context is likely to contain the answer because it provides information about a ruler who fits the time frame of the claim. 3. "Catuvellauni" context: This context is relevant because it talks about the Celtic tribe of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, which is the region and period in question. It may contain the answer as it provides background on the people who were ruled by the Celtic leader mentioned in the claim.

Since the question is about the number of victories of Ernest Foot's best friend, this context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer. 2. Context idx 2: This context provides information about Albert Ball, including the number of his aerial victories. Since Albert Ball is mentioned as the best friend of Ernest Foot in context idx 9, this context is also highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 0: While this context mentions a fighter pilot, Manfred Meurer, and his victories, it does not have a direct connection to Ernest Foot or his best friend. However, it is still informative about a fighter pilot's victories during World War II. The other contexts are about different pilots and do not seem to be directly related to the claim.

Question:Which professional baseball player and National 1993 Baseball Hall of Fame inductee is featured in the Greatest Sports Legends anthology? 
golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine the top 3 ranked contexts, I will evaluate each context based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim is about a professional baseball player who was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993 and is featured in the Greatest Sports Legends anthology.
1. "Reggie Jackson" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Reggie Jackson, a professional baseball player who was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993, which matches the claim's criteria. Additionally, since Reggie Jackson is a notable athlete, there is a high likelihood that he could be featured in the Greatest Sports Legends anthology.
2. "Greatest Sports Legends" context: This context is directly related to the anthology mentioned in the claim. It provides information about the series and the athletes featured, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. "Mickey Mantle" context: Although Mickey Mantle was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974, not 1993, the context is still somewhat relevant because it pertains to a professional baseball player who is a Hall of Fame inductee. However, it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that match the specific year mentioned.
The other contexts are less relevant as they either mention players inducted into the Hall of Fame in years other than 1993 or discuss athletes from different sports or achievements unrelated to the claim.

step-by-step think: To address the claim about whether Chrysalis and Look are both women's magazines, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Chrysalis (magazine)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Chrysalis" and describes it as a feminist publication, which indicates that it is a women's magazine. It provides detailed historical information about the magazine, its founders, content, and contributors, making it very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Look (UK magazine)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions "Look" and describes it as a fashion and celebrity weekly magazine for young women. The description of its content and target audience makes it clear that it is a women's magazine, thus likely containing the answer to the claim. 3. "List of magazines in Malaysia" context: Although this context does not directly mention "Chrysalis" or "Look," it provides information about women's magazines in Malaysia and mentions some international women's magazines published there. It is less directly relevant than the first two contexts but still contains information about women's magazines, which could be useful in answering the claim.

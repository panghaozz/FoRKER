Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation:
Step 1: Identify the movie featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective - The context paragraph for 'End of Days (film)' describes the film "End of Days" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as former New York Police Department detective Jericho Cane.

Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy

Evidence and explanation: Badly Drawn Boy, the stage name for Damon Michael Gough, is described as a multi-instrumentalist, which implies that he plays multiple instruments. In contrast, Wolf Alice is a four-piece band with each member presumably playing one instrument.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation:
Step 1: Analyze the context for Wolf Alice - The context states that Wolf Alice is a four-piece band, which typically means there are four instruments played by the four members.
Step 2: Analyze the context for Badly Drawn Boy - The context describes Badly Drawn Boy as a multi-instrumentalist, which means he plays more than one instrument.
Step 3: Compare the instrument to person ratio - Since Badly Drawn Boy is a single person who plays multiple instruments, his instrument to person ratio is higher than that of Wolf Alice, where the ratio is likely one instrument per person.
Step 4: Confirm the answer - Given that Badly Drawn Boy plays several instruments and Wolf Alice has a fixed number of band members with one instrument each, Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio.

Question:Which British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II?
Right Answer:English Electric Canberra
Answer: English Electric Canberra

Evidence and explanation: The English Electric Canberra is identified as a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. It was developed during the mid-to-late 1940s and introduced into service with the Royal Air Force in May 1951.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation:
Step 1: Identify the context relevant to British first-generation jet-powered medium bombers - Context index 5, titled 'English Electric Canberra', describes a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber.
Step 2: Confirm the bomber's use in the specified theatre - While the context does not explicitly state that the English Electric Canberra was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, it does mention that No. 2 Squadron RAAF, which operated from RAAF Base Williamtown, flew a variety of aircraft types including bombers and was equipped with English Electric Canberra jets during its service history. This squadron saw action in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II.
Step 3: Cross-reference with other contexts - None of the other provided contexts describe a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II.
Step 4: Conclude the answer - Based on the information provided, the English Electric Canberra is the most likely candidate for the British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. However, it should be noted that the Canberra was introduced into service in 1951, after the end of World War II, which means it would not have seen action during the war. The question may contain an error as no British first-generation jet-powered medium bombers were used in World War II since they were not in service until after the war had ended.

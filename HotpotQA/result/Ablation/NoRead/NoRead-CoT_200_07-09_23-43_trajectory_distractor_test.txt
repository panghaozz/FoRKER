Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine the instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments played in relation to the number of people in the act. From the context provided:
1. Badly Drawn Boy is a stage name for Damon Michael Gough, who is a multi-instrumentalist. This implies that he plays more than one instrument.
2. The context further elaborates that Damon Gough wrote, produced, and played several instruments on the album's eighteen tracks, indicating a high instrument to person ratio since he is a solo performer.
3. On the other hand, Wolf Alice is a four-piece band with each member presumably playing one instrument, which suggests a one-to-one instrument to person ratio.
Therefore, Badly Drawn Boy, being a solo act and a multi-instrumentalist, has a higher instrument to person ratio compared to Wolf Alice, which is a band with four members.

Question:The 2011–12 VCU Rams men's basketball team, led by third year head coach Shaka Smart, represented Virginia Commonwealth University which was founded in what year?
Right Answer:1838
Answer: Virginia Commonwealth University was founded in 1838.
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine the founding year of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), I reviewed the provided context. The first piece of context (idx: 0) states that "VCU was founded in 1838 as the medical department of Hampden–Sydney College, becoming the Medical College of Virginia in 1854."

The subsequent details about the merger in 1968 to create VCU and the university's current programs and student body are additional information that confirms the institution's long-standing history but do not alter the founding year. Therefore, based on the context given, the answer is 1838.

Question:Rostker v. Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional?
Right Answer:Conscription
Answer: The practice of requiring only men to register for the draft.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The context provided from idx 2 states that Rostker v. Goldberg was a decision by the United States Supreme Court.
2. The decision held that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.
3. The Supreme Court's decision was based on the fact that the United States Congress had enacted the law to apply to men only after extensive hearings, debates, and committee sessions.
4. The gender distinction of requiring only men to register for the draft was challenged as unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court held in a 6-3 decision that this gender distinction did not violate the equal protection component of the due process clause.
5. Therefore, the practice upheld by the Supreme Court in Rostker v. Goldberg was the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft.

Question:How many copies of Roald Dahl's variation on a popular anecdote sold?
Right Answer:250 million
Answer: The specific number of copies sold of Roald Dahl's variation on a popular anecdote is not provided in the context given.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. I reviewed the context provided to find specific information about the sales of Roald Dahl's books.
2. The first piece of context (idx: 6) mentions that Roald Dahl's books have sold more than 250 million copies worldwide, but this refers to the total sales of all his books, not a specific variation on an anecdote.
3. The second piece of context (idx: 3) discusses "Roald Dahl: Collected Stories," which is a collection of short stories for adults, but does not provide sales figures.
4. The third piece of context (idx: 5) mentions "The Collected Short Stories of Roald Dahl," another collection of stories, but again, no sales figures are provided.
5. Since none of the context pieces include the specific sales numbers for a variation on a popular anecdote, I cannot provide an exact figure.
6. Therefore, based on the information available, I concluded that the specific sales figure for Roald Dahl's variation on a popular anecdote is not stated in the provided context.

Question:Which American film director hosted the 18th Independent Spirit Awards in 2002?

Step-by-step reasoning: The context provided includes three pieces of information. The first piece of context (index 9) directly states that "The 2002 Independent Spirit Awards... were announced on March 22, 2003. It was hosted by John Waters."

The third piece of context (index 7) describes the Film Independent Spirit Awards but does not provide information about the host. Therefore, based on the first piece of context, the answer is determined to be John Waters.

Question:Do the drinks Gibson and Zurracapote both contain gin?
Right Answer:no

The context for Zurracapote describes it as a popular Spanish alcoholic mixed drink, similar to sangría, which consists of **red wine mixed with fruit** such as peaches and lemons, sugar, and cinnamon. It also mentions that some recipes call for the addition of other alcoholic beverages, but gin is not specifically mentioned.
3. Based on the information given, the Gibson clearly contains gin as one of its main ingredients.
4. However, the description of Zurracapote does not list gin as an ingredient, instead, it lists red wine as the alcoholic base.
5. Therefore, based on the provided context, only the Gibson contains gin, while Zurracapote does not.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. Context index 7 mentions the Mascogos, also known as "negros mascagos," who are centered in the town of El Nacimiento in Múzquiz Municipality, Coahuila, Mexico.

Right Answer:George Raft
Answer: George Raft
Step-by-step reasoning: The question asks for the American film actor and dancer who starred in the 1945 film "Johnny Angel." By examining the provided context:
- The first piece of context (idx: 3) mentions that "Johnny Angel" stars George Raft, Claire Trevor, and Signe Hasso.
- The second piece of context (idx: 0) provides information about George Raft, stating that he was an American film actor and dancer, known for his roles in crime melodramas and as a dancer in the film "Bolero."

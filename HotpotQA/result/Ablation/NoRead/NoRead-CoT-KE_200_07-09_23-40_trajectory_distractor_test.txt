Question:Who is older, Annie Morton or Terry Richardson?
Right Answer:Terry Richardson
Answer: Terry Richardson is older than Annie Morton.
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. From the provided contexts, we can find the birth dates of both individuals.
2. Context index 0 mentions the date **(August 14, 1965)**, but does not specify whose date of birth it is.
3. Context index 3 mentions both **Terry Richardson** and **Annie Morton**, followed by the date **(October 8, 1970)**. This context does not explicitly link the date to either person, but since both names are mentioned before the date, it suggests that this date is relevant to one of them.
4. Context index 1 mentions **Terry Richardson** multiple times but does not provide a date of birth.
5. By analyzing the context, we can infer that the date **(August 14, 1965)** is likely to be Terry Richardson's date of birth since the other date mentioned is in 1970, which is later.
6. Therefore, since August 14, 1965, is earlier than October 8, 1970, Terry Richardson is older than Annie Morton.

Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine the instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of people in each act and the number of instruments they use. From the provided contexts:
- Context index 2 and 8 mention **Badly Drawn Boy**, which is the stage name of **Damon Gough**. This indicates that Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act, meaning there is only one person.
- Context index 0 mentions **Wolf Alice**, which includes four members: **Ellie Rowsell, Joff Oddie, Theo Ellis, and Joel Amey**.

Since Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act, even if he plays only one instrument, the instrument to person ratio would be 1:1. In contrast, for Wolf Alice to have a higher ratio, each member would need to play more than one instrument during a performance. The context does not provide information on the number of instruments played by Wolf Alice, but given that they are a traditional band setup, it's unlikely that each member plays multiple instruments simultaneously.

Therefore, based on the information provided, **Badly Drawn Boy** has a higher instrument to person ratio than Wolf Alice.

Question:Are both Dictyosperma, and Huernia described as a genus?
Right Answer:yes
Answer: Yes
Step-by-step reasoning: The context provided mentions both Dictyosperma and Huernia. The context for Dictyosperma is limited but includes the name twice, which suggests it is a recognized term, likely a genus. The context for Huernia provides more detail, including references to botanical subfamilies such as Apocynaceae and Asclepiadoideae, and geographical regions like Eastern and Southern Africa. The mention of 1810 and related genera such as Stapelia and Hoodia, along with the name Justin Heurnius, who is associated with botanical nomenclature, supports the idea that Huernia is indeed a genus. Therefore, based on the context provided, it can be concluded that both Dictyosperma and Huernia are described as a genus.

Question:The Livesey Hal War Memorial commemorates the fallen of which war, that had over 60 million casualties?
Right Answer:World War II
Answer: World War II
Step-by-step reasoning: The claim asks which war the Livesey Hall War Memorial commemorates, specifically the one with over 60 million casualties. By analyzing the provided contexts:
- Context index 2 mentions both World War I and World War II in relation to The Livesey Hall War Memorial, but does not specify the number of casualties.
- Context index 5 mentions World War II multiple times but also does not specify the number of casualties.
- Context index 9 mentions World War II in relation to The Rainham War Memorial and refers to "World Wars," implying more than one war.

Since the claim specifies a war with over 60 million casualties, we can infer that it refers to World War II, as it is the only war among the two World Wars that had such a high number of casualties. Therefore, the Livesey Hall War Memorial commemorates the fallen of World War II.

Right Answer:no
Answer: Yes
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine if both Cypress and Ajuga are genera, I analyzed the provided context:

Step-by-step reasoning: To determine the nationality of Alfred Gell and Edmund Leach, I analyzed the provided contexts. Context index 2 mentions Edmund Ronald Leach with the term "British" in parentheses, indicating his nationality as British. Although Alfred Gell's nationality is not explicitly stated in the provided contexts, context index 9 mentions him in association with Bronisław Malinowski's work on the Trobriand Islanders, which does not provide direct information about his nationality. However, context index 1 mentions "The Association of Social Anthropologists" in relation to the UK and the Commonwealth, suggesting a connection to the United Kingdom. Since the question is about both Gell and Leach and one is confirmed as British, it is reasonable to infer that Alfred Gell, being associated with the same field and mentioned in the context related to the UK, is also British. Therefore, both social anthropologists, Alfred Gell and Edmund Leach, were British.

Question:In which year was the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours born?
Right Answer:1865
Answer: 1865
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the year of birth for the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours, I analyzed the provided contexts. Context index 7 mentions George V with his full name George Frederick Ernest Albert, stating his birth date as 3 June 1865. Since George V was the King of the United Kingdom from 6 May 1910 until 1936, he would have been the monarch who made the 1925 Birthday Honours. Therefore, the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours was born in the year 1865.

Question:What is the county seat of the county where East Lempster, New Hampshire is located?
Right Answer:Newport
Answer: Newport
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine the county seat of the county where East Lempster, New Hampshire is located, I analyzed the provided contexts. Context index 2 mentions "(Newport), (Sullivan County), (U.S.), (New Hampshire)", which indicates that Newport is a location in Sullivan County, New Hampshire.

Question:The Album Against the Wind was the 11th Album of a Rock singer Robert C Seger born may 6 1945. What was the Rock singers stage name ?
Right Answer:Bob Seger
Answer: Bob Seger
Step-by-step reasoning: The context provided mentions "Robert Clark Seger" and "Bob Seger" interchangeably, indicating that "Bob Seger" is the stage name used by the rock singer Robert C Seger. This is supported by multiple instances within the context where "Bob Seger" is directly associated with activities typical of a rock singer, such as being part of "the Silver Bullet Band" and being involved in the music scene since the 1960s. Therefore, the stage name for Robert C Seger is "Bob Seger."

Question:Rostker v. Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional?
Right Answer:Conscription
Answer: Conscription
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the answer to the claim, I analyzed the provided contexts. Context index 2 mentions "Rostker", "Goldberg", and "the Selective Service System" in relation to the U.S. Supreme Court, which suggests a legal case involving these entities. Context index 4 provides the information that "Conscription" has been a method used by the United States to fill vacancies in the Armed Forces, particularly mentioned in relation to the Selective Service System. Since the question is about the Rostker v. Goldberg case and the practice of filling armed forces vacancies, and given that the Selective Service System is associated with conscription, it is reasonable to conclude that the Rostker v. Goldberg case held that the practice of conscription was constitutional.

Question:Do the drinks Gibson and Zurracapote both contain gin?
Right Answer:no
Answer: No
Step-by-step reasoning: The context provided does not give a complete list of ingredients for either Gibson or Zurracapote. However, based on the information given:
- The context for Gibson references a book titled "The World's Drinks And How To Mix Them" by William Boothby, which suggests it is a mixed drink but does not specify ingredients.
- The context for Zurracapote indicates it is Spanish and takes several days to make, which suggests it may be a fermented drink, but again, no specific ingredients are mentioned.
- The context from Phillips Distilling Company lists various spirits and products, including a gin product called "Gin-Ka," but does not link this product to either Gibson or Zurracapote.

Without explicit information connecting gin to both drinks, we cannot conclude that both contain gin. Therefore, based on the contexts provided, the answer is no.

Answer: George Raft
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the answer to the claim, I analyzed the provided contexts:
1. Context index 3 mentions **George Raft** alongside the film **Johnny Angel** and the year **1945**, which corresponds to the claim's details about the film and its release year.

Question:When was the  former Indian cricketer who made his ODI debuts during the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy born? 
Right Answer:7 October 1978
Answer: 7 October 1978
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the answer, I analyzed the provided contexts for information about the Indian cricketer who made his ODI debut during the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy and his birthdate.

Question:Which airplane was this Major test-flying after whom the base, that 514th Flight Test Squadron is stated at, is named?
Right Answer:B-17 Flying Fortress bomber
Answer: B-17 Flying Fortress bomber
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the answer, I analyzed the provided contexts for any mention of a Major after whom a base is named and any reference to an airplane he might have been test-flying. Context index 4 mentions "(Peter Hill), (the U.S. Army Air Corps), (the B-17 Flying Fortress)," and "(Hill AFB), (Utah)." From this, it can be inferred that "Peter Hill" is the Major after whom "Hill Air Force Base" is named. It also mentions "the B-17 Flying Fortress" in the same context, which suggests that this is the airplane Major Peter Hill was test-flying. Therefore, the airplane Major Peter Hill was test-flying, after whom the base that the 514th Flight Test Squadron is stationed at is named, is the "B-17 Flying Fortress bomber."

Question:Based on a True Story... is an album by which country music star, with the single My Eyes?
Right Answer:Blake Shelton
Answer: Blake Shelton
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the answer to the claim, I analyzed the provided contexts. Contexts with index 8 and 9 mention Blake Shelton, who is an American country music star. The context with index 8 includes several references to Shelton and dates that align with the release of albums and singles. Although the single "My Eyes" is not explicitly mentioned in the contexts, the repeated references to Blake Shelton and the associated dates suggest that he is the artist in question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the contexts, the country music star associated with the album "Based on a True Story..." and the single "My Eyes" is Blake Shelton.

Answer: The component of shellite with the formula (ON)CHOH is not explicitly mentioned in the provided contexts.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. I reviewed the provided contexts for any chemical formulas or components related to shellite.
2. Context index 4 mentions picric acid, IUPAC, TNP, and Greek, but does not provide a chemical formula that matches (ON)CHOH.
3. Context index 8 mentions Picric, Dinitrophenol, Picric again, Hexanitrodiphenylamine, Royal Navy, and the 20th century, but again, no chemical formula is provided that matches (ON)CHOH.
4. Context index 0 is empty and provides no information.
5. Since none of the contexts contain the chemical formula (ON)CHOH, I cannot determine which component of shellite it refers to based on the given information.
6. Therefore, the answer is that the component of shellite with the formula (ON)CHOH is not identified in the provided contexts.

This is supported by the context index 6 and 1, which mention Skin Yard alongside terms like "American," "Seattle," "Washington," and connections to other American bands like Soundgarden. However, the context index 3 includes a clear "no" and mentions Bulgaria, suggesting that the band Ostava is not from the U.S. but from Bulgaria. Therefore, while Skin Yard was from the U.S., Ostava was not, leading to the answer "No" for the question of whether both bands were from the U.S.

Step-by-step reasoning: To find the answer to the claim, I analyzed the provided contexts:
1. Context index 5 mentions **Owsley Stanley** as an American who was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement during the 1960s.
2. Context index 7 also mentions **Owsley Stanley** and provides a date, **8 October 1973**, which is associated with the Boarding House in San Francisco.
3. Context index 3 talks about **Gary Edson Arlington**, another American from the 1960s, but there is no mention of the album "Old and in the Way."

From this analysis, it is clear that the American audio engineer and clandestine chemist referred to in the question is **Owsley Stanley**. The date provided in context index 7 (8 October 1973) is likely the recording date or a significant date related to the album "Old and in the Way."

Context index 2 mentions "Spynie Palace" and "the late 12th Century" in the same paragraph, suggesting that Spynie Palace, which is the palace in question, was founded in the late 12th Century. This is supported by the fact that the paragraph also mentions "the Bishops of Moray" and "about 500 years," which aligns with the historical timeline of Spynie Palace being the residence of the Bishops of Moray for approximately 500 years from its founding in the late 12th Century. Therefore, the palace at which Columba de Dunbar died in 1435 was founded in the late 12th Century.

Question:At what venue was the January 2, 2012 game featured the University of Louisville team?
Right Answer:Mercedes-Benz Superdome
Answer: Mercedes-Benz Superdome
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the venue of the January 2, 2012 game featuring the University of Louisville team, I analyzed the provided contexts:
- Context index 1 mentions the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in connection with a date, Wednesday, January 2, 2013, and the Louisville Cardinals. However, the year mentioned here is 2013, not 2012.
- Context index 9 mentions the Louisville Cardinals, the University of Louisville, and the Sugar Bowl in 2012, but does not specify the venue.
- Context index 7 does not mention the specific date in question.

Since the question asks for the venue on January 2, 2012, and the only context that mentions a similar date (January 2, 2013) is the first one, which includes the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, it's reasonable to infer that the venue for the January 2, 2012 game was also the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. This inference is based on the common practice of annual events like the Sugar Bowl being held at the same venue, and the context suggests that the Sugar Bowl featuring the University of Louisville took place at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome around that time.

2. Context index 9 discusses **Gimme Shelter** and mentions the **Cannes Film Festival** in 1971, but there is no mention of an Oscar nomination.
3. Context index 1 mentions **Merry Clayton**, the song **Gimme Shelter**, and the term **Oscar** in relation to Clayton, but it is in the context of the year **2013** and does not link the documentary **Gimme Shelter** to an Oscar nomination.

Based on this analysis, only **LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton** is directly associated with an Oscar nomination for **Best Documentary Feature**, indicating that it was the film that was Oscar-nominated.

Context index 5 provides the information that the World Cup of 2014 was hosted by Brazil. Since the question asks for the location where Algeria first qualified for the round of 16, and the context indicates that this occurred in 2014, the answer is Brazil, as that is where the 2014 FIFA World Cup was held.

Question:Who did the Star and Dagger bass player marry?
Right Answer:Sean Yseult.
Answer: Chris Lee
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the answer to the question of who the Star and Dagger bass player married, I analyzed the provided contexts. The bass player for Star and Dagger is mentioned as Sean Yseult. In the first context (idx: 1), it lists several names associated with Sean Yseult, including Chris Lee. Since the context mentions New Orleans, where Sean Yseult is based, and the names are listed together, it suggests a close association. None of the other contexts provide information about a marriage or a spouse. Therefore, by process of elimination and association, the most likely answer is Chris Lee, as he is the only individual associated with Sean Yseult in a context that could imply a marital relationship.

Answer: The 58th quadrennial American presidential election held after the 2016 Michigan Democratic primary was the United States presidential election of 2020.
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The context provided mentions the United States presidential election of 2016, which indicates that the 2016 election is not the one in question as it occurred before the Michigan Democratic primary in 2016.
2. The Michigan Democratic primary mentioned in the context occurred on March 8, 2016, which is part of the electoral process leading up to the 2016 presidential election.
3. The next quadrennial (occurring every four years) presidential election after 2016 would be in the year 2020.
4. The context with 'idx': 8 specifically mentions the year 2020 and the date Tuesday, November 3, 2020, which aligns with the typical scheduling of U.S. presidential elections on the first Tuesday of November every four years.
5. Therefore, based on the information provided in the contexts and the process of elimination, the 58th quadrennial American presidential election held after the 2016 Michigan Democratic primary is the election that took place in 2020.

Step-by-step reasoning: The question asks for the name of a man born on 6 March 1937 who was also a citizen of the United Kingdom. By analyzing the provided contexts:
- Context index 0 mentions William Bonfield, with a birth date of 6 March 1937 and described as British, which implies he is a citizen of the United Kingdom.

Question:Which English musician is known for both the songs "See Yourself" and "Withing You Without You"?
Right Answer:George Harrison
Answer: George Harrison
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the answer, I analyzed the provided contexts for mentions of the songs "See Yourself" and "Within You Without You".

Question:Which professional ice hockey position does the Captain of the National Hockey League All-Star Game "Away Team" play?
Right Answer:Canadian professional ice hockey centre
Answer: Centre
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine the position played by the Captain of the National Hockey League All-Star Game "Away Team," I analyzed the provided contexts.

Question:Do The Importance of Being Icelandic and The Five Obstructions belong to different film genres ?
Right Answer:no
Answer: Yes
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine if "The Importance of Being Icelandic" and "The Five Obstructions" belong to different film genres, I analyzed the provided context for each film. The context for "The Importance of Being Icelandic" includes the year 1998, names Jon Gustafsson, Iceland, Canada, and Islendingadagurinn, which suggests it might be a documentary or a film related to cultural or national identity, given the reference to an annual Canadian event celebrating Icelandic culture. On the other hand, "The Five Obstructions" context mentions the year 2003, Danish origins, and filmmakers Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth. It also references "The Perfect Human," a 1967 film, and the involvement of von Trier, indicating that this film could be an experimental or avant-garde film, especially considering von Trier's known filmography. Therefore, based on the context clues, it is reasonable to conclude that the two films belong to different genres.

Question:Tefik Selim Mborja was a part of a party that held power in Albania until what year? 
Right Answer:1943
Answer: 1943
Step-by-step reasoning: To find the answer, I analyzed the provided contexts for any mention of Tefik Selim Mborja and the Albanian Fascist Party, which he was a part of. Context index 3 mentions that the Albanian Fascist Party, also known as Partia Fashiste e Shqipërisë, was active during World War II and associated with Albania from 1939 to 1943.

Therefore, the answer is 1943, which is the year until the Albanian Fascist Party, with which Tefik Selim Mborja was associated, held power in Albania.

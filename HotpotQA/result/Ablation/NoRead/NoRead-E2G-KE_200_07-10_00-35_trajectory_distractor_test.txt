Question:The arena where the Lewiston Maineiacs played their home games can seat how many people?
Right Answer:3,677 seated
Answer: The arena can seat 3,677 people.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided in index 9 states "(3,677 seated), (The Androscoggin Bank Colisée)...", which directly answers the question about the seating capacity of the arena where the Lewiston Maineiacs played their home games.

Question:Who is older, Annie Morton or Terry Richardson?
Right Answer:Terry Richardson
Answer: Terry Richardson is older than Annie Morton.
Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that Terry Richardson's associated date is August 14, 1965, and Annie Morton's associated date is October 8, 1970. Since August 14, 1965, is earlier than October 8, 1970, it means Terry Richardson was born before Annie Morton, making him older.

Question:Are Local H and For Against both from the United States?
Right Answer:yes
Answer: Yes

Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that Local H is associated with the terms (American), (Illinois), and (1987), suggesting that they are an American band from Illinois. Additionally, the context for For Against includes (a United States), (Lincoln), (Nebraska), (1984), which implies that For Against is also an American band, specifically from Lincoln, Nebraska.

Step by step with evidence and explanation:

2. The context index 6 mentions (a United States), (Lincoln), (Nebraska), (1984) without a specific band name, but given that For Against is the other band in question, it is reasonable to infer that this context refers to For Against as an American band from Lincoln, Nebraska, formed in 1984.
3. No context is provided that directly mentions For Against, but the process of elimination and the specific mention of American locations in the context suggest that both bands are from the United States.

Question:Are Giuseppe Verdi and Ambroise Thomas both Opera composers ?
Right Answer:yes
Answer: Yes

Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that both Giuseppe Verdi and Ambroise Thomas are associated with opera. Giuseppe Verdi is referred to with an Italian context, and given his well-known status as an opera composer, it's reasonable to infer that the context refers to him in this capacity. Ambroise Thomas is associated with French context and specific operas such as 'Mignon' (1866) and 'Hamlet' (1868), which are known works of opera, further indicating his role as an opera composer.

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The context index 4 mentions "Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi" with a date that could be related to his death, and labels him as Italian. Giuseppe Verdi is a renowned opera composer from Italy, known for operas like 'Aida' and 'La Traviata'.
2. The context index 5 mentions "Charles Louis Ambroise Thomas" with dates that span his life, labels him as French, and lists operas 'Mignon' and 'Hamlet', which are known operas. This suggests that Ambroise Thomas is also an opera composer.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided in index 4 mentions "(1969 until 1974), (Richard Milhous Nixon)," indicating the years Richard Nixon served as the president of the United States.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation:

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The original Apple Remote was designed to interact with Apple TV, as mentioned in context index 2.
2. Context index 0 introduces the Siri Remote, which is associated with the 4th Generation Apple TV, indicating that it is a device that can control Apple TV.
3. Context index 6 discusses the Apple Watch, which, while not explicitly stated in the context to control Apple TV, is known to be able to do so as a product of Apple Inc.
4. Therefore, both the Siri Remote and the Apple Watch are devices that can control the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with, aside from the Apple Remote itself.

Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio.
Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that Badly Drawn Boy is a stage name for a single individual, Damon Gough, whereas Wolf Alice is a band consisting of four members: Ellie Rowsell, Joff Oddie, Theo Ellis, and Joel Amey.
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. From the context index 2 and 8, we can gather that Badly Drawn Boy is the stage name of a single person, Damon Gough.
2. From context index 0, we learn that Wolf Alice is a band with four members.
3. Assuming each member of Wolf Alice plays at least one instrument, the minimum instrument to person ratio would be 1:1.
4. Since Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act, if he plays more than one instrument, the instrument to person ratio would be greater than 1:1.
5. Therefore, without specific numbers of instruments mentioned, we can infer that Badly Drawn Boy, being a solo act, likely has a higher instrument to person ratio compared to Wolf Alice, which is a group of four individuals.

Question:The 2011–12 VCU Rams men's basketball team, led by third year head coach Shaka Smart, represented Virginia Commonwealth University which was founded in what year?
Right Answer:1838
Answer: Virginia Commonwealth University was founded in the year 1968.

Evidence and explanation: The evidence is found in the context provided with index 0, which mentions the year 1968 in relation to the Virginia General Assembly and the creation of Virginia Commonwealth University.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The question asks for the founding year of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU).
2. Context index 0 provides a timeline of events related to VCU, mentioning several key dates.
3. Within this context, the year 1968 is associated with the Virginia General Assembly, which is the legislative body that would have the authority to establish a university.

5. The context does not explicitly state "founded in 1968," but by mentioning the Virginia General Assembly in the same breath as VCU and given the legislative body's role, it can be inferred that 1968 is the year VCU was established.
6. This inference is supported by the absence of any other dates in the provided contexts that could represent the founding year of VCU.
7. Therefore, based on the information given, 1968 is the correct answer.

Question:Are both Dictyosperma, and Huernia described as a genus?
Right Answer:yes
Answer: Yes

Evidence and explanation: The context provided mentions both Dictyosperma and Huernia. While the context for Dictyosperma is limited, it does include the term itself, which is a genus of palms commonly known as the Princess Palm. The context for Huernia indicates it is associated with the Apocynaceae family and Asclepiadoideae subfamily, which are taxonomic classifications that suggest it is a genus, specifically of flowering plants found in Eastern and Southern Africa.

Step by step with evidence and explanation: 
1. The context index 0 mentions "(Dictyosperma), (Dictyosperma), (Greek)," which implies the term Dictyosperma is a classification category, likely a genus, as it is not followed by any species designation.
2. The context index 1 mentions "(Huernia), (Apocynaceae), (Asclepiadoideae),..." along with geographical regions and historical references. The inclusion of family (Apocynaceae) and subfamily (Asclepiadoideae) names, without further species-level classification, suggests that Huernia is also a genus.
3. The repetition of the context for Huernia reinforces the information provided, indicating that it is not a singular species but a group of species within a genus.
4. Based on the taxonomic hierarchy, the presence of family and subfamily names without species names typically indicates a genus level classification for both Dictyosperma and Huernia. Therefore, it can be concluded that both are described as a genus.

Question:Are Ferocactus and Silene both types of plant?
Right Answer:yes
Answer: Yes

Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that both Ferocactus and Silene are associated with specific regions (United States, Mexico for Ferocactus and Alaska, Canada, United States for Silene) and biological classifications (Caryophyllaceae for Silene).

Question:Which British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II?
Right Answer:English Electric Canberra
Answer: The British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II was not mentioned in the provided contexts.

Evidence and explanation: The contexts provided mention the English Electric Canberra, which is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. However, it was not used during World War II as it was developed later and saw service during the Malayan Emergency, the Vietnam War, and other conflicts after World War II.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. Context index 8 mentions the English Electric Canberra in relation to the Royal Australian Air Force and its use in conflicts such as the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.
2. The same context also mentions World War II but does not link the English Electric Canberra to that time period.
3. Context index 3 and 1 mention World War II but do not specify the use of the English Electric Canberra during that conflict.
4. By analyzing the dates and conflicts mentioned in the contexts, it is clear that the English Electric Canberra was not in service during World War II and therefore could not have been used in the South West Pacific theatre of that war.
5. The absence of any other British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber in the provided contexts leads to the conclusion that the specific bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II is not mentioned in the given contexts.

Question:Which year and which conference was the 14th season for this conference as part of the NCAA Division that the Colorado Buffaloes played in with a record of 2-6 in conference play?
Right Answer:2009 Big 12 Conference
Answer: The 14th season for the conference as part of the NCAA Division that the Colorado Buffaloes played in with a record of 2-6 in conference play was the 2009 Big 12 Conference.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that 2009 was the 14th season for the conference in which the University of Colorado participated.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
- Context index 1 mentions "(2009 Big 12 Conference), (2009), (the 14th season), (2009)" which indicates that 2009 was the 14th season of the Big 12 Conference.
- Context index 7 supports this by mentioning "(2009), (Colorado), (the University of Colorado), (2009), (NCAA), (FBS)" which connects the University of Colorado with the 2009 NCAA season.
- Context index 8 does not provide relevant information about the 14th season or the conference record, as it discusses the year 2011 and the Pac-12 Conference, which is not the conference in question for the 14th season.
- Therefore, combining the information from context indices 1 and 7, it is clear that the 2009 season was the 14th season for the Big 12 Conference, and this is the conference and year in which the Colorado Buffaloes had a 2-6 record in conference play.

Question:In what year was the novel that Lourenço Mutarelli based "Nina" on based first published?
Right Answer:1866
Answer: 1866
Evidence and explanation: The novel "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, which is the novel that Lourenço Mutarelli's "Nina" is based on, was first published in 1866.
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: To determine the year of the first publication of the novel that "Nina" is based on, we need to identify the original novel and its publication date. Context index 3 mentions "Mutarelli" and "Crime and Punishment" in 2004, which is likely the year Mutarelli referenced the novel. However, this does not provide the original publication year of "Crime and Punishment." Context index 6 provides the necessary information, stating "1866" twice in relation to "Crime and Punishment" and "Dostoyevsky," indicating that this is the year "Crime and Punishment" was first published. Context index 0 mentions "Cheiro" in 2006, which is related to Mutarelli but does not pertain to the original publication year of "Crime and Punishment." Therefore, the answer is derived from context index 6, which clearly states the year 1866 as the first publication year of "Crime and Punishment," the novel that "Nina" is based on.

2. The second piece of context mentions "(Canary Islands, Spain), (Spanish), (Tenerife), (Canary Islands), (Spain)" but does not directly mention Teide National Park.
3. The third piece of context provides the missing link by stating "(Canary Islands, Spain), (The Roque Cinchado), (Tenerife), (Canary Islands), (Spain), (the Teide National Park)", which confirms that Teide National Park is located in Tenerife, part of the Canary Islands, Spain.
4. By analyzing the given contexts, it is evident that both national parks are situated within the Canary Islands, Spain. Garajonay National Park is on the island of La Gomera, and Teide National Park is on the island of Tenerife.

Question:Do the drinks Gibson and Zurracapote both contain gin?
Right Answer:no
Answer: No

Evidence and explanation: The provided contexts do not contain sufficient information to confirm that both drinks contain gin. The context for Gibson references a book titled "The World's Drinks And How To Mix Them" by William Boothby, which could imply that Gibson is a mixed drink, but does not explicitly state that it contains gin. The context for Zurracapote only mentions that it is Spanish and takes several days to prepare, with no mention of ingredients. The context from Phillips Distilling Company lists various spirits and products, including a gin-like product called "Gin-Ka," but does not link this product to either Gibson or Zurracapote.

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The context for Gibson mentions a mixology book from 1908, which suggests that Gibson is a mixed drink. However, there is no direct mention of gin being an ingredient in the Gibson.
2. The context for Zurracapote indicates it is a Spanish drink that takes several days to prepare. This context does not provide any details on the ingredients, so we cannot ascertain if gin is included.
3. The context from Phillips Distilling Company lists various alcoholic products they produce, including "Gin-Ka," which seems to be a gin-related product. However, there is no evidence provided that connects "Gin-Ka" or any gin to either the Gibson or Zurracapote drinks.
4. Without explicit information on the ingredients of Gibson and Zurracapote, we cannot conclude that both drinks contain gin. Therefore, based on the available context, the answer is no.

Question:In which city is the ambassador of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region to China based?
Right Answer:Beijing
Answer: Beijing
Evidence and explanation: The context provided in index 6 mentions "(Beijing), (Moroccan), (Beijing), (the People's Republic of China)", which indicates that the Moroccan ambassador referenced is based in Beijing.
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: The task is to determine the city where the ambassador of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region to China is based. By analyzing the given contexts:

Question:Over how many centuries were the "dwelling place of the dead" built?
Right Answer:three centuries
Answer: Three centuries
Evidence and explanation: The context provided in index 5 explicitly states "three centuries" in relation to the Montezuma Castle National Monument, which is referred to as the "dwelling place of the dead."
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: To determine the number of centuries over which the "dwelling place of the dead" was built, we analyze the given contexts. Context index 5 mentions "(three centuries), (Montezuma Castle National Monument), (Camp Verde), (Arizona), (Sinagua), (Hohokam), (United States), (1425 AD), (three centuries)." The repetition of "three centuries" before and after the mention of Montezuma Castle National Monument, which is known as a dwelling place of the dead, indicates that the construction spanned over three centuries. This specific context provides direct evidence to answer the question, making it unnecessary to consider the other contexts for this particular query.

Question:When was the British author who wrote the novel on which "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush" was based born? 
Right Answer:7 January 1936
Answer: 7 January 1936
Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that Edward Hunter Davies, who is British and associated with the Beatles, was born on 7 January 1936. This information is found in the context with index 6.
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: To find the birth date of the British author who wrote the novel on which "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush" was based, we look at the provided contexts for mentions of the novel and any associated authors. Context index 2 mentions "Mulberry Bush" and "Hunter Davies" in relation to the year 1967 and the Cannes Film Festival in May 1968. Context index 6 confirms that Edward Hunter Davies, who is British, was born on 7 January 1936. Since "Hunter Davies" is mentioned in context with the "Mulberry Bush," and given that there is no other author mentioned in the contexts, we can conclude that Edward Hunter Davies is the author in question, and his birth date is 7 January 1936.

Question:Which component of shellite has the formula (ON)CHOH?
Right Answer:picric acid
Answer: The component of shellite with the formula \( \text{(ON)CHOH} \) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided contexts.

Evidence and explanation: The provided contexts contain information about different compounds such as picric acid, dinitrophenol, and hexanitrodiphenylamine. However, none of these compounds have the formula \( \text{(ON)CHOH} \).

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The formula \( \text{(ON)CHOH} \) suggests a compound with an oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and a hydroxyl group (OH).
2. Context index 4 mentions picric acid, IUPAC, TNP, and Greek, but does not provide a chemical formula that matches \( \text{(ON)CHOH} \).
3. Context index 8 mentions Picric, Dinitrophenol, Hexanitrodiphenylamine, Royal Navy, and the 20th century. Among these, Dinitrophenol could potentially be a candidate because it contains nitro groups (NO2) and phenol (OH), but the exact formula is not given, and it does not match \( \text{(ON)CHOH} \).
4. Context index 0 is empty and provides no information.
5. Therefore, based on the available contexts, there is no direct match for the formula \( \text{(ON)CHOH} \) in the text provided. The answer is derived by process of elimination and the absence of the specific formula in the given contexts.

Question:The Argentine PGA Championship record holder has won how many tournaments worldwide?
Right Answer:230
Answer: 230
Evidence and explanation: The context provided in index 3 clearly states the number 230 next to Roberto De Vicenzo's name, indicating the total number of tournaments he has won worldwide.
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
- The question asks for the number of tournaments won worldwide by the Argentine PGA Championship record holder.
- By examining the contexts, we find that Roberto De Vicenzo is mentioned in both index 1 and index 3 contexts.
- The context at index 1 lists notable players associated with the Argentine PGA Championship but does not provide specific numbers of tournaments won.
- The context at index 3, however, provides a specific number, 230, alongside Roberto De Vicenzo's name, which indicates the total number of tournaments he has won.
- Since Roberto De Vicenzo is a prominent figure in Argentine golf and is mentioned in relation to the Argentine PGA Championship, it is reasonable to conclude that he is the record holder being referred to.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the contexts, the answer to the question is that the Argentine PGA Championship record holder has won 230 tournaments worldwide.

Question:Suicide's 1977 released album features a song based on what brand's comic character?
Right Answer:Marvel
Answer: Marvel Comics
Evidence and explanation: The context provided does not include direct information about a song from Suicide's 1977 album that is based on a comic character. However, by analyzing the given contexts, we can infer the answer. Context index 7 mentions "Marvel" and "Marvel Comics," which are known for their comic book characters. Context index 3 confirms that the band "Suicide" released an album in 1977. Although context index 9 mentions "Batman," which is a comic character, Batman is associated with DC Comics, not Marvel Comics. Therefore, the only comic brand mentioned in the contexts that could be related to Suicide's 1977 album is "Marvel Comics."
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. Identify the band and the year of the album release: Context index 3 mentions "Suicide" and "1977," indicating the band and the year of the album in question.
2. Look for mentions of comic brands or characters: Context index 7 mentions "Marvel" and "Marvel Comics," while context index 9 mentions "Batman."
3. Determine the correct comic brand: Since "Batman" is a character from DC Comics and the question asks for a brand's comic character, "Batman" is not the correct answer. The remaining comic brand mentioned is "Marvel Comics" from context index 7.
4. Conclude the answer: With the information available, the most logical conclusion is that Suicide's 1977 album features a song based on a "Marvel Comics" character.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The claim asks for the political position held by the person who introduced the DISCLOSE Act.
2. Context index 1 mentions Christopher Van Hollen Jr. as a United States Senator from Maryland starting January 3, 2017.

Question:Were the bands Skin Yard and Ostava from the U.S.?
Right Answer:no
Answer: No

Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that Skin Yard was an American band from Seattle, Washington. However, it also clearly states that Ostava is not from the U.S. but from Bulgaria.

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. Context index 6 mentions Skin Yard alongside descriptors like "American," "Seattle," "Washington," which confirms that Skin Yard was indeed a band from the U.S.
2. Context index 3 contains a clear "no" alongside "Bulgaria," indicating that Ostava is not an American band but a Bulgarian one.
3. Context index 1 reinforces the information about Skin Yard being associated with the American music scene in Seattle, further confirming their U.S. origin.
   
Therefore, while Skin Yard was a band from the U.S., Ostava was not, leading to the conclusion that not both bands were from the U.S.

2. Context index 1 provides information about a game that took place on "Wednesday, January 2, 2013," which is a year later than the date mentioned in the question. However, it is the only context that mentions a specific venue along with a date that closely matches the query.
3. The same context mentions "the Louisville Cardinals," which is the team associated with the University of Louisville.
4. It also mentions "Sugar Bowl," which is a college football game, and this context is linked to the Louisville Cardinals.
5. By correlating these pieces of information, it can be deduced that the game featuring the University of Louisville team on a date close to January 2, 2012, was held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. The discrepancy in the year (2012 vs. 2013) is noted, but based on the available contexts, this is the most accurate answer.

Right Answer:yes
Answer: Yes

Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that Broughtonia is associated with Orchidaceae, which is the family that includes all orchids.

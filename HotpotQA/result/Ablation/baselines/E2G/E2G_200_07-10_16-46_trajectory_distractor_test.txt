Question:This singer of A Rather Blustery Day also voiced what hedgehog?
Right Answer:Sonic
Answer: The singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" who also voiced a hedgehog is Jim Cummings.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that "A Rather Blustery Day" is a song from the Walt Disney musical film featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day", and it was sung by Jim Cummings as "Pooh" (context index 9). Additionally, Jim Cummings is known for voicing various characters, including Dr. Robotnik from "Sonic the Hedgehog" (context index 4), who is a hedgehog antagonist in the series.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The question asks for the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" who also voiced a hedgehog.
2. By examining the context provided, we find that "A Rather Blustery Day" is associated with the film "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" (context index 9).
3. The same context index (9) reveals that Jim Cummings sang the song as the character "Pooh".
4. Looking at the context index 4, we see that Jim Cummings is also known for voicing Dr. Robotnik from "Sonic the Hedgehog".
5. Dr. Robotnik, while not a hedgehog himself, is a character from the "Sonic the Hedgehog" series, which is centered around a hedgehog.
6. Therefore, Jim Cummings is the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" and is associated with a hedgehog through his voice work as Dr. Robotnik. This answers the question posed.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The claim states that aside from the Apple Remote, there is another device that can control the program that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with.
2. We can look for evidence about other devices that can control the program in the given context.
3. In the context, we can see that the Siri Remote is mentioned as the successor of the original Apple Remote and it is designed specifically to work with the Siri capable Apple TV.
4. This means that the Siri Remote can control the program that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with.
5. Therefore, the answer is that the Siri Remote can control the program that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with.

Note: There may be other devices that can control the program as well, but the context only mentions the Siri Remote as a device that can do so.

Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio.

Evidence and explanation:
The context provided indicates that Wolf Alice is a four-piece band, which typically means they have at least four primary instruments corresponding to the members. On the other hand, Badly Drawn Boy, being a stage name for Damon Michael Gough, is a solo act. The context mentions that he is a multi-instrumentalist, which implies that he plays more than one instrument.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation:
1. From the context index 0, we know that Wolf Alice has four members, each presumably playing at least one instrument.
2. From the context index 2, we learn that Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act and a multi-instrumentalist, which means he plays multiple instruments.
3. Given that Badly Drawn Boy is one person who plays several instruments, while Wolf Alice is a band of four people likely with one instrument each, the instrument to person ratio for Badly Drawn Boy is higher than that of Wolf Alice. This is because the ratio for Badly Drawn Boy would be greater than one, while the ratio for Wolf Alice would be one or possibly less if any members play the same instrument.

Question:Which British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II?
Right Answer:English Electric Canberra
Answer: The English Electric Canberra

Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that the English Electric Canberra is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. It was developed in the mid-to-late 1940s and introduced into service with the Royal Air Force in May 1951.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The question asks for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II.
2. The context provided under the title 'English Electric Canberra' describes it as a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber.
3. The timeline fits the period of World War II, as it was developed during the 1940s, which is within the timeframe of the war.
4. Although the English Electric Canberra was introduced to service in 1951, after the end of World War II, it is the only aircraft in the provided context that matches the description of a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber.
5. Therefore, based on the information given, the English Electric Canberra is the most likely answer to the question.

Question:What type of activity does Owner earnings and Warren Buffett have in common?
Right Answer:business
Answer: The type of activity that Owner earnings and Warren Buffett have in common is **investment valuation**.

Evidence and explanation: The concept of Owner earnings is directly associated with Warren Buffett, as it is a valuation method he detailed in 1986. According to the context provided, Buffett stated that the value of a company is the total of the net cash flows (owner earnings) expected to occur over the life of the business, minus any reinvestment of earnings.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. **Owner earnings** is a term coined by Warren Buffett, which refers to the net cash flows expected from a business over its lifetime, after accounting for reinvestment needs (Context index 3).
2. Warren Buffett is known for his **value investing** strategy, which involves assessing the intrinsic value of a company and investing in it if the market price is significantly below that value (Context index 0).
3. The acquisition of TaeguTec by Berkshire Hathaway, of which Buffett is the CEO, is an example of this investment valuation activity in practice. Buffett saw value in TaeguTec and invested in it, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway (Context index 1).
4. This investment approach aligns with the Owner earnings concept, as Buffett would assess the future net cash flows of TaeguTec as part of his valuation method before deciding to invest.
5. Therefore, the common activity between Owner earnings and Warren Buffett is the practice of valuing companies based on their expected future net cash flows, which is a fundamental aspect of Buffett's investment philosophy.

Question:Over how many centuries were the "dwelling place of the dead" built?
Right Answer:three centuries
Answer: The "dwelling place of the dead" were built over three centuries.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided from the Montezuma Castle National Monument indicates that the dwellings were built and used by the Sinagua people between approximately 1100 and 1425 AD. This spans over three centuries.

Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation:

Question:Were the bands Skin Yard and Ostava from the U.S.?
Right Answer:no
Answer: No

Evidence and explanation: The context provided indicates that Skin Yard was an American band based in Seattle, Washington.

On the other hand, the title "Ostava" clearly states that Ostava is an alternative rock band from Bulgaria.

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. Context index 0 ("Gruntruck") and index 1 ("Jack Endino") mention that Skin Yard was formed in Seattle, Washington, and its members were involved in the Seattle music scene, which is part of the United States.
2. Context index 3 ("Ostava") explicitly states that Ostava is a band from Bulgaria, not the United States.
3. The remaining context indices (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) provide additional information about Skin Yard and its association with the American grunge movement, reinforcing the fact that Skin Yard was indeed an American band.

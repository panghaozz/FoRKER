Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Wolf Alice**:
   - Wolf Alice is a four-piece band consisting of Ellie Rowsell (vocals, guitar), Joff Oddie (guitars, vocals), Theo Ellis (bass), and Joel Amey (drums, vocals). 
   - Therefore, they have 4 members and at least 4 instruments (guitar, bass, drums, and vocals).

2. **Badly Drawn Boy**:
   - Badly Drawn Boy is the stage name of Damon Michael Gough, who is described as a multi-instrumentalist.
   - This implies that he plays multiple instruments himself.

3. **Instrument to Person Ratio**:
   - For Wolf Alice: The ratio is 4 instruments to 4 people, which simplifies to 1:1.
   - For Badly Drawn Boy: Since he is a multi-instrumentalist, he plays multiple instruments by himself. Even if he plays just 2 instruments, the ratio would be 2:1, which is higher than 1:1.

Therefore, Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio compared to Wolf Alice.

The keyboard function keys, as mentioned in the context from 'Front Row (software)', can also control the software that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with.
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. The Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers, as well as the first three generations of Apple TV (from 'Apple Remote' context).
2. The Siri Remote is a successor of the original Apple Remote and is designed to work with the Apple TV (from 'Siri Remote' context). This implies that the Siri Remote can control the program that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with.
3. The Front Row software, which the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with, can also be controlled by the keyboard function keys (from 'Front Row (software)' context). This means that the keyboard function keys can control the program that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with.

Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy
Evidence and explanation: Badly Drawn Boy, also known as Damon Gough, is described as a multi-instrumentalist, indicating that he plays multiple instruments. On the other hand, Wolf Alice is a four-piece band, with each member typically playing one instrument.
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: 
1. From the context provided, we learn that Wolf Alice is a four-piece band (context idx: 0). This typically means that there are four members, each playing one instrument, giving a ratio of 1:1 for instruments to persons.
2. In contrast, Badly Drawn Boy is described as a multi-instrumentalist (context idx: 2). This means that he plays more than one instrument. Since Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act, this gives a ratio of more than 1:1 for instruments to persons.
3. Therefore, based on the information provided, Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio than Wolf Alice.

Question:Are both Dictyosperma, and Huernia described as a genus?
Right Answer:yes
Answer: Yes, both Dictyosperma and Huernia are described as a genus.

Evidence and explanation: The context provided describes Dictyosperma as a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. Similarly, Huernia is described as a genus that consists of stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa.

Question:Are Freakonomics and In the Realm of the Hackers both American documentaries?
Right Answer:no
Answer: No
Evidence and explanation: While "Freakonomics: The Movie" is an American documentary, "In The Realm of the Hackers" is an Australian documentary.
Step-by-step reasoning with evidence and explanation: The context provided gives information about both documentaries. For "Freakonomics: The Movie", the context from index 9 states that it is a 2010 American documentary film based on the 2005 book "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" by economist Steven D. Levitt and writer Stephen J. Dubner. This confirms that "Freakonomics: The Movie" is an American documentary. On the other hand, the context from index 6 states that "In The Realm of the Hackers" is a 2003 Australian documentary directed by Kevin Anderson about the prominent hacker community, centered in Melbourne, Australia in the late 1980s until early 1990. This confirms that "In The Realm of the Hackers" is an Australian documentary, not an American one. Therefore, the claim that both "Freakonomics: The Movie" and "In The Realm of the Hackers" are American documentaries is incorrect.

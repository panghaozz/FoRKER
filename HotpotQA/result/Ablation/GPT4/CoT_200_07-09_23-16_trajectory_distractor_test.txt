Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio.

Step-by-step reasoning: From the context, we can see that Wolf Alice is a four-piece band (context index 0), meaning there are four members in the band. On the other hand, Badly Drawn Boy is a stage name for Damon Michael Gough (context index 2), who is a single person.

Therefore, the instrument to person ratio for Badly Drawn Boy is higher than that of Wolf Alice, as there is only one person in Badly Drawn Boy playing multiple instruments, while there are four people in Wolf Alice, presumably each playing one instrument.

Question:Where did the descendants of the group of black Indians associated with the Seminole people settle?
Right Answer:Coahuila, Mexico
Answer: The descendants of the group of black Indians associated with the Seminole people settled in Oklahoma and Coahuila, Mexico.

Step-by-step reasoning: From the context provided, we can gather that the Seminole people, including the Black Seminoles, were originally from Florida (context idx: 2).

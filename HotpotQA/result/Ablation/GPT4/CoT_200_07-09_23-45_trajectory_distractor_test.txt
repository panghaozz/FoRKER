Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
Right Answer:Badly Drawn Boy
Answer: Badly Drawn Boy
Step-by-step reasoning: From the context, we can see that Wolf Alice is a four-piece band, meaning there are four members in the band. Each member likely plays at least one instrument, so the instrument to person ratio is at least 1:1. On the other hand, Badly Drawn Boy is a stage name for Damon Michael Gough, who is described as a multi-instrumentalist. This implies that he plays more than one instrument. Since he is a solo artist, the instrument to person ratio is greater than 1:1. Therefore, Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio than Wolf Alice.

Question:Are Freakonomics and In the Realm of the Hackers both American documentaries?
Right Answer:no

Step-by-step reasoning: From the context provided, we can see that 'Freakonomics: The Movie' is an American documentary film based on the 2005 book "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" by economist Steven D.

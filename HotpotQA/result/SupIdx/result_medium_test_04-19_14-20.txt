Question:Who is younger Mary Ramsey or Lee Ranaldo ?
golden idx: [0, 9]
idx: [7, 8]
Step by step with evidence and explanation: First, the context at index 7 provides effective support for the claim. It mentions Mary Ramsey Wood, who was born in 1787 and was reported to be the oldest living person in the United States when she died, supposedly at the age of 120. However, there is evidence suggesting that this age claim was inaccurate or exaggerated, and she may have been between 96 and 98 when she died. This context establishes the existence of Mary Ramsey and provides information about her age, but it does not directly compare her age to Lee Ranaldo's or Mary Ramsey's age, so it is not directly relevant to determining who is younger between Mary Ramsey and Lee Ranaldo.

Secondly, the context at index 8 provides effective support for the claim. It discusses Mary Ramsey, born on December 24, 1963, who is a member of the folk rock duo John & Mary and the lead singer and violinist for the American alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs. This context establishes Mary Ramsey's birth year, allowing for a direct comparison of ages between Mary Ramsey and Lee Ranaldo. Since Mary Ramsey was born in 1963 and Lee Ranaldo was born in 1956, Mary Ramsey is younger than Lee Ranaldo by seven years. Therefore, the context at index 8 is directly relevant to determining who is younger between Mary Ramsey and Lee Ranaldo.

First, let's consider context at index 0, titled "History of the Indiana Pacers." This context provides direct and clear information about the home venue of the Indiana Pacers, stating, "The Pacers play in the Eastern Conference and Central Division, and they play their home games at Bankers Life Fieldhouse."

This direct connection establishes the venue for Lance Stephenson's home games.

Secondly, context at index 5, titled "Indiana Pacers," offers further support for the claim. It explicitly states, "They play their home games at Bankers Life Fieldhouse." Since Lance Stephenson is part of the Indiana Pacers, as mentioned in context 7, it logically follows that he plays his home games at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, as the team's home venue.

golden idx: [0, 6]
idx: [0, 6]
Step by step with evidence and explanation: 

First, the context at index 0 provides effective support for the claim. It states that the Columbia Kingsmen changed their name to Sha Na Na because of another group with a similar name, which was known for the song "Louie Louie." This indicates a direct connection between the name change and the song "Louie Louie," suggesting that the song associated with the other group played a significant role in prompting the name change.

It further explains that the song has become a standard in pop and rock, with hundreds of versions recorded by different artists. Since the song "Louie Louie" is well-known and has been covered by various artists, including The Kingsmen, it is plausible that this song could have influenced the Columbia Kingsmen to change their name to Sha Na Na to avoid confusion with the other group known for performing "Louie Louie."

golden idx: [0, 6]
idx: [0, 6]

Step by step with evidence and explanation:
1. The context at index 0 titled "Prochlorococcus" provides effective support for the claim. It mentions that Prochlorococcus is a genus of marine cyanobacteria responsible for a large percentage of the photosynthetic production of oxygen on Earth. Additionally, it states that these bacteria belong to the photosynthetic picoplankton and are among the major primary producers in the ocean. This implies that Prochlorococcus is involved in photosynthesis, which suggests that essential components for photosynthesis would be found in Prochlorococcus. Since chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis and Prochlorococcus is a photosynthetic organism, it is reasonable to infer that chlorophyll is found in Prochlorococcus.
2. The context at index 6 titled "Chlorophyll" also provides effective support for the claim. It explains that chlorophyll is essential in photosynthesis and is found in cyanobacteria, which includes Prochlorococcus. Chlorophyll "a" is specifically mentioned as the photosynthetic pigment essential for photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. Since Prochlorococcus is a cyanobacterium and involved in photosynthesis, it is reasonable to infer that chlorophyll "a" is found in Prochlorococcus. Therefore, this context also supports the claim.

Therefore, the contexts at index 2 and 7 are the most effective in providing support for the claim.

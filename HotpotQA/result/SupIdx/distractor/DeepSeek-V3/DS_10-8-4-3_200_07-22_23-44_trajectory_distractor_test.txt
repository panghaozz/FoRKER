golden idx: [1, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine which band, Letters to Cleo or Screaming Trees, had more members, we need to identify the number of members in each band. The most relevant contexts will directly mention the members of either Letters to Cleo or Screaming Trees.

This indicates 4-5 members, making it highly relevant for Screaming Trees.

3. "Gary Lee Conner" context (idx 4): This mentions Gary Lee Conner as a member of Screaming Trees, which is relevant but less informative than the full list in idx 9.

4. "Van Conner" context (idx 5): This mentions Van Conner as a member of Screaming Trees, which is relevant but less informative than the full list in idx 9.

Question:Are Yingkou and Fuding the same level of city?
golden idx: [7, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine if Yingkou and Fuding are the same level of city, we need to find contexts that provide information about their administrative levels. The most relevant contexts would be those that explicitly mention the city levels of Yingkou and Fuding. 

1. "Yingkou" context (idx 9): This directly states that Yingkou is a prefecture-level city, which is highly relevant to the claim.
2. "Fuding" context (idx 7): This mentions that Fuding is a county-level city, which is directly relevant to the claim.
3. "Yingkou East Railway Station" context (idx 1): This mentions Yingkou as a prefecture-level city, reinforcing the information from idx 9.
4. "Yingkou Lanqi Airport" context (idx 5): This provides additional information about Yingkou as a city, supporting its prefecture-level status.
5. "Bayuquan Railway Station" context (idx 8): This also mentions Yingkou as a prefecture-level city, further confirming its status.
6. "Fuding Railway Station" context (idx 2): This mentions Fuding as a city within Ningde, supporting its county-level status.
7. "Taimushan Railway Station" context (idx 4): This also mentions Fuding as a city within Ningde, reinforcing its county-level status.
8. "Tongcheng Subdistrict, Fuding" context (idx 6): This provides additional context about Fuding as a city, though less directly about its administrative level.

Other contexts (idx 0, 3) are less relevant as they do not provide information about the city levels of Yingkou or Fuding.

idx: [9, 7, 1, 5, 8, 2, 4, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Yingkou" context: It directly states that Yingkou is a prefecture-level city, which is crucial for answering the claim about its administrative level. 2. "Fuding" context: It directly states that Fuding is a county-level city, which is crucial for answering the claim about its administrative level. 3. "Yingkou East Railway Station" context: It mentions Yingkou as a prefecture-level city, but the focus is on the railway station, making it less directly relevant than the first two contexts. 4. "Fuding Railway Station" context: It mentions Fuding as a city, but does not specify its administrative level, making it less directly relevant than the first two contexts. 5. "Tongcheng Subdistrict, Fuding" context: It mentions Fuding as a city but does not specify its administrative level, making it less directly relevant. 6. "Yingkou Lanqi Airport" context: It mentions Yingkou but does not specify its administrative level, making it less directly relevant. 7. "Bayuquan Railway Station" context: It mentions Yingkou as a prefecture-level city, but the focus is on the railway station, making it less directly relevant. 8. "Taimushan Railway Station" context: It mentions Fuding but does not specify its administrative level, making it less directly relevant.
idx: [9, 7, 1, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Yingkou" context: It directly states that Yingkou is a prefecture-level city, which is crucial information for comparing city levels. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Fuding" context: It directly states that Fuding is a county-level city, which is also crucial for the comparison. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Yingkou East Railway Station" context: It provides additional information about Yingkou being a prefecture-level city, but this is redundant with the first context and less directly informative for the claim. 4. "Fuding Railway Station" context: It mentions Fuding City but does not specify its administrative level, making it less directly informative for the claim compared to the second context.

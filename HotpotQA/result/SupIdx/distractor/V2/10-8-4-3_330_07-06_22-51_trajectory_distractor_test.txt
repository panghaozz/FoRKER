step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify which contexts directly mention "B Boy" or related terms. Context 5 is the most relevant as it is about the song "B Boy" by Meek Mill, which is directly related to the claim. Context 9 provides information about Meek Mill, including where he was raised, which is highly relevant to the claim.

Contexts 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 do not mention "B Boy" or Meek Mill and are therefore less relevant to the claim.

Question:Which case was decided first, Selle v. Gibb or Reynolds v. Sims?
golden idx: [4, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine which case was decided first, Selle v. Gibb or Reynolds v. Sims, we need to look at the context that provides the dates of the decisions. 1. "Selle v. Gibb" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to one of the cases in question and provides the decision date of 1984, which is essential for determining the order. 2.

"Charles Morgan Jr." context: This context mentions the "Reynolds v. Sims" case and the attorney involved, which is relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim than the direct mention of the case. 4. "Reynolds v. United States" context: This context is about a different "Reynolds" case but is included because it provides a date that could help establish a timeline. 5. "Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd" context: This context is related to the "Reynolds" name but is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 6.

"Reynolds v. Pegler" context: This context is about a different "Reynolds" case and is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 8. "Criminal law in the Waite Court" context: This context is included because it mentions a "Reynolds" case, but it is not directly related to the claim.

Sims" case, providing additional background information that supports the relevance of the "Reynolds v. Sims" context. 4. "Reynolds v.

step-by-step think:1. "Reynolds v. Sims" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the specific year (1964) when the case was decided, which is crucial for determining which case was decided first. 2. "Selle v.

3. Context idx 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9: These contexts mention various species of Goldenrod but do not provide information about the total number of species within the genus. They are informative regarding the Goldenrod species but less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to idx 6 and 2.
After considering the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the contexts are ranked as follows:
idx: [6, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the genus of Sorbaria and Goldenrod, specifically whether they consist of more than 50 flowering plants. To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer.
1. "Goldenrod" context (idx: 6): This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Goldenrod (Solidago) is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants. It directly addresses the claim regarding the number of species in the genus Goldenrod.
2. "Sorbaria" context (idx: 2): This context is also highly relevant as it provides the exact number of species in the genus Sorbaria, which is around 9. It directly contradicts the claim that Sorbaria has more than 50 species.
3. "Solidago elongata" context (idx: 0): While this context provides information about a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, it does not address the claim about the number of species in the genus.
4. "Solidago ouachitensis" context (idx: 1): Similar to idx: 0, this context talks about a specific species within the Goldenrod genus and does not provide information about the total number of species.
5. "Solidago rupestris" context (idx: 3): Again, this context is about a specific species and does not address the total number of species in the genus.
6. "Brintonia" context (idx: 4): This context is about a different genus in the same family as Goldenrod but does not provide information relevant to the claim.
7. "Solidago curtisii" context (idx: 5): This context, like the others about specific species of Goldenrod, does not address the claim about the number of species in the genus.
8. "Solidago rugosa" context (idx: 7): This context also discusses a specific species of Goldenrod and does not provide information about the total number of species in the genus.

Based on the relevance and informativeness regarding the claim, the top four contexts are:
idx: [6, 2, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the number of species in the genera Sorbaria and Goldenrod. 1. "Goldenrod" context: This context is highly relevant as it specifies that Goldenrod (Solidago) has about 100 to 120 species, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Sorbaria" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the exact number of species in the Sorbaria genus, which is around 9, directly addressing the other half of the claim. 3. "Solidago elongata" context: While this context provides information about a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, it does not offer information about the total number of species, making it less relevant than the general information about the genus as a whole. 4. "Solidago ouachitensis" context: Similar to the previous context, this one provides information about a specific species within the Goldenrod genus and is less relevant to the claim regarding the total number of species in the genus.

"Garrison, New York" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Garrison, a location across from West Point, and discusses the area's history, which may provide additional insights into the foundry's background. However, it does not directly mention the foundry, so it may be less likely to contain the specific answer. 4. "Hudson Highlands State Park" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it covers the geographical area where the foundry was located, but it does not directly mention the foundry or provide specific information about it, making it less likely to contain the answer than the previous contexts.
idx: [2, 6, 8, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "Robert Parker Parrott" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Robert Parker Parrott, who became the superintendent of the West Point Iron and Cannon Foundry in Cold Spring, New York. It directly addresses the claim by providing information about the foundry's location and its association with Parrott, which is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Cold Spring, New York" context: This context is also relevant because it describes Cold Spring as a village in Putnam County, where the foundry was located. It mentions the West Point Foundry as a historic place, which is likely to be the foundry in question. 3. "Garrison, New York" context: While this context is informative about the area across from West Point, it does not mention the foundry or its relevance to the claim directly. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to the first two contexts.

Question:What fictional character created by Tom Clancy was turned into a film in 2002?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about a fictional character created by Tom Clancy that was turned into a film in 2002. The character in question is Jack Ryan, and the film is "The Sum of All Fears". Therefore, contexts that mention Jack Ryan and the film adaptation will be ranked highest. 1. 'The Sum of All Fears' context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions the film adaptation of the book in 2002, which is the answer to the claim. 2. 'Jack Ryan (character)' context: This context is highly relevant as it talks about the character Jack Ryan, who is the answer to the claim. 3. 'Tom Clancy's Net Force Explorers: Cold Case' context: This context is about a series created by Tom Clancy but does not mention the film or the character Jack Ryan. 4. 'Tom Clancy's Net Force Explorers: Gameprey' context: Similar to context 3, it is about a series by Tom Clancy but lacks direct relevance to the claim. 5. 'Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow' context: This context is about a different series and character (Sam Fisher), and while it is related to Tom Clancy, it does not answer the claim. 6. 'Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)' context: This context is also about Sam Fisher and does not pertain to the claim about Jack Ryan.
idx: [3, 5, 0, 1, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for a fictional character created by Tom Clancy that was turned into a film in 2002. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions a character from a Tom Clancy novel that was adapted into a film during that year. 
1. 'The Sum of All Fears' context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that the novel was part of the Jack Ryan universe and was turned into a film in 2002, directly answering the claim.
2. 'Jack Ryan (character)' context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Jack Ryan, a character created by Tom Clancy who appears in his novels and their respective film adaptations.
3. 'Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow' context: This context is less relevant because it discusses a video game character, Sam Fisher, and the game's release, not a film adaptation.
4. 'Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)' context: Similar to the previous context, this one is about the video game character Sam Fisher and does not mention a film adaptation.
5. 'Tom Clancy's Net Force Explorers: Cold Case' context: This context is about a young adult novel series and does not mention any film adaptation.
6. 'Tom Clancy's Net Force Explorers: Gameprey' context: This context is also about the Net Force Explorers series and does not mention a film adaptation.

Given that there are only six contexts provided and the task requires ranking the top eight, the last two contexts will be ranked by default even though they are not directly relevant to the claim.

idx: [3, 5, 2, 4, 0, 1]

step-by-step think:1. "The Sum of All Fears" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the novel by Tom Clancy and specifies that it was turned into a film in 2002, directly answering the claim. 2. "Jack Ryan (character)" context: This context is also relevant because it provides information about the character Jack Ryan, created by Tom Clancy, who is the protagonist in the novel mentioned in the first context. It is likely to contain additional details pertinent to the claim. 3. "Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)" context: While this context is about a different character created by Tom Clancy, it is less relevant to the claim since it does not mention the 2002 film adaptation. However, it is still informative about Clancy's work.

"Fruit salad" context: While this context discusses a dish that includes fruit, it is less relevant because it does not specifically mention wheat salad or its typical ingredients. However, it still has some relevance to the claim. The other contexts are less relevant as they either discuss different types of salads that do not typically include wheat or red fruits, or they mention fruits that are not commonly associated with wheat salad.
idx: [3, 1, 0, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Wheat salad" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions wheat salad and lists tomatoes, which are typically red, as one of its ingredients. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Tomato" context: This context is relevant because it provides detailed information about tomatoes, which are a red fruit and mentioned as an ingredient in the wheat salad context. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Salad bar" context: While this context mentions tomatoes, it is less directly related to wheat salad specifically. However, it is still somewhat relevant and may contain the answer. 4. "Fruit salad" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not specifically mention wheat salad or tomatoes but discusses fruit salad in general.

Question:Which playwright lived a longer life, Edward Albee or J. M. Barrie?
golden idx: [4, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine which playwright lived a longer life, we need to find the birth and death dates for both Edward Albee and J. M. Barrie. Contexts that contain this information are most relevant. 1. "Edward Albee" context: This context provides the full lifespan of Edward Albee, which is essential to answer the claim. 2. "J. M. Barrie" context: This context provides the full lifespan of J. M. Barrie, which is also essential to answer the claim. 3. "Reed A. Albee" context: This context mentions the adoptive father of Edward Albee and includes dates that could potentially be confused with Edward Albee's lifespan, so it is relevant but less so than the direct mentions. 4. "The Zoo Story" context: This context mentions Edward Albee's first play and its completion date, which is relevant but does not directly answer the claim. 5. "Three Tall Women" context: This context mentions a play by Edward Albee and the Pulitzer Prize, which is informative but not directly relevant to the claim. 6. "Edward F. Albee Foundation" context: This context is about a foundation started by Edward Albee, which is informative but not directly relevant to the claim. 7. "Edward Albee's At Home at the Zoo" context: This context discusses a play by Edward Albee, which is informative but not directly relevant to the claim. 8. "Finding the Sun" context: This context mentions another play by Edward Albee, which is informative but not directly relevant to the claim.
idx: [8, 4, 3, 1, 0, 2, 7, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine which playwright lived a longer life, we need to compare the lifespan of Edward Albee and J. M. Barrie. The context about Edward Albee (idx: 8) provides his exact dates of birth and death, which are crucial for calculating his age at death. Similarly, the context about J. M. Barrie (idx: 4) gives his dates of birth and death. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative for answering the question. The context about Reed A. Albee (idx: 3) is less relevant because it focuses on Edward Albee's adoptive father rather than Edward Albee himself. However, it is still more relevant than the other contexts because it is related to Edward Albee's family. The remaining contexts (idx: 1, 0, 2, 7, 5) are about Edward Albee's works and foundation, which do not provide information on his lifespan and are therefore not directly relevant to the claim.
idx: [8, 4, 3, 1]

step-by-step think: To determine which playwright lived a longer life, we need to compare the lifespan of Edward Albee and J. M. Barrie. 1. "Edward Albee" context: This context provides specific birth and death dates for Edward Albee, allowing us to calculate his age at death. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "J. M. Barrie" context: This context provides specific birth and death dates for J. M. Barrie, which is essential to determine his age at death. It is equally relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Reed A. Albee" context: While this context is about Edward Albee's adoptive father and mentions the family's connection to the theater, it does not provide information on Edward Albee's lifespan. It is less relevant and unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "The Zoo Story" context: This context discusses one of Edward Albee's plays and its significance but does not provide information on his lifespan. It is informative about Albee's work but not relevant to the claim about the playwrights' lifespans.

step-by-step think: 1. "Impresario" context: This context is highly relevant as it defines the term "impresario," which is directly related to the claim about Vanessa Bley's role. It provides a comprehensive explanation of the responsibilities and history of an impresario, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

"Joseph McGrath (film director)" context: This context is equally important because it states that Joseph McGrath is Scottish, which answers the other half of the claim. 3. "John Ince (actor)" context: This context is related because it provides background on John Ince, who is related to Thomas H. Ince, but it does not directly address the claim. 4. "Ralph Ince" context: Similar to the previous context, this provides information on another relative of Thomas H. Ince, which could be indirectly relevant to the claim. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not provide direct information about the nationalities of the individuals in question.
idx: [0, 8, 3, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine if Thomas H. Ince and Joseph McGrath were of the same nationality, we need to look at the contexts that provide information about their nationalities. 1. "Thomas H. Ince" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly states that Thomas H. Ince was an American. It is informative and contains the answer to part of the claim regarding Thomas H. Ince's nationality. 2. "Joseph McGrath (film director)" context: This context is equally relevant because it specifies that Joseph McGrath is Scottish. It provides the answer to the other part of the claim regarding Joseph McGrath's nationality. 3. "John Ince (actor)" context: This context mentions John Ince, who is related to Thomas H. Ince, and confirms his American nationality. While it does not directly address the claim, it supports the information given in the first context about the Ince family's nationality. 4. "Ralph Ince" context: Similar to the third context, this one also discusses a member of the Ince family, Ralph Ince, and confirms his American nationality. However, it is less directly related to the claim than the contexts about Thomas H. Ince and Joseph McGrath.

Question:Are Phlebodium and Pieris both species of ferns?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to identify contexts that discuss whether Phlebodium and Pieris are species of ferns. Contexts that mention Phlebodium and its classification as a fern are most relevant. Contexts that discuss Pieris as a plant genus related to ferns are also relevant, but we must distinguish between Pieris as a plant and Pieris as a butterfly, as the latter is not relevant to the claim.

1. Context idx 6: This context directly mentions Phlebodium as a genus of ferns, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 5: This context discusses Phlebodium aureum, a specific species within the Phlebodium genus, and describes it as a fern, which is directly relevant to the claim.
3. Context idx 2: This context talks about leptosporangiate ferns, a large group of ferns, which may include Phlebodium, making it relevant.
4. Context idx 8: This context discusses tree ferns, which could be relevant if Phlebodium is considered a tree fern, but it's less directly related to the claim than contexts that specifically mention Phlebodium.
5. Context idx 4: This context mentions Pieris as a plant genus, which is relevant since the claim involves determining if Pieris is a fern.
6. Context idx 9: This context also discusses Pieris as a plant genus, providing additional information that could be relevant to the claim.
7. Context idx 3: This context mentions Pieris japonica, a plant, which is relevant to the claim, but it focuses on an insect pest rather than the classification of the plant.
8. Context idx 0 and idx 1: These contexts discuss Pieris as a butterfly, which is not relevant to the claim about ferns.
9. Context idx 7: This context also discusses Pieris as a butterfly, which is not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the contexts are ranked as follows:
idx: [6, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 3, 0]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 6: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Phlebodium is a genus of ferns. It directly addresses half of the claim regarding Phlebodium being a species of fern. 2. Context idx 4: This context is crucial because it clarifies that Pieris is not a fern but a genus of shrubs in the family Ericaceae. This directly addresses the other half of the claim regarding Pieris. 3. Context idx 5: This context provides additional information about a specific species within the Phlebodium genus, supporting the relevance of the first context. 4. Context idx 9: This context offers detailed information about Pieris floribunda, a species within the Pieris genus, which is relevant to the claim about Pieris. 5. Context idx 2: While this context discusses ferns broadly, it does not specifically mention Phlebodium or Pieris, making it less directly relevant than the others. 6. Context idx 8: This context talks about tree ferns, which is related to the topic of ferns but does not directly address the claim. 7. Context idx 3: This context mentions Pieris as a host plant for a pest, which is somewhat relevant but less so than the contexts that describe what Pieris is. 8. Context idx 0: This context is about a butterfly named Pieris canidia, which is not relevant to the claim about plant species.
idx: [6, 4, 5, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. "Phlebodium" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Phlebodium is a genus of ferns, directly addressing half of the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Phlebodium aureum" context: Although this context focuses on a specific species within the Phlebodium genus, it supports the information that Phlebodium is related to ferns, which is relevant to the claim. It is less likely to contain the answer to the full claim since it does not address Pieris. 3. "Pieris (plant)" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the Pieris genus but clarifies that it is not a fern, instead belonging to the Ericaceae family. This directly addresses the other half of the claim. 4. "Pieris floribunda" context: Similar to the "Pieris (plant)" context, it provides specific information about a species within the Pieris genus, confirming it is not a fern. It is relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the full claim compared to the "Pieris (plant)" context.

golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about Bartlett's Bridge and the likelihood of containing the answer about the engineer and the Massachusetts county seat. 1. "Bartlett's Bridge" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Bartlett's Bridge and provides information about its construction and the engineer, Charles A. Allen, who worked for the city of Worcester. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Worcester, Massachusetts" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Worcester, the city for which Charles A. Allen worked as a civil engineer when designing Bartlett's Bridge. It is likely to contain supporting information about the county seat. 3. "Henry Covered Bridge (Ohio)" context: This context mentions a bridge near Bartlett, Ohio, which could be confused with Bartlett's Bridge. It is less relevant but might contain useful comparative information. 4. "Shinn Covered Bridge" context: This context is about a bridge in the same state as Bartlett's Bridge and mentions local carpenter Charles T. Shinn, which might be relevant for comparative purposes. 5. "Eisenhower Bridge (Milton, Iowa)" context: This context is about bridge construction and mentions engineers and bridge companies, which could provide background information on bridge engineering during the relevant period. 6. "Sutliff Bridge" context: This context is about a bridge and its engineer, which might offer comparative insights into bridge engineering practices. 7. "Cerro Gordo County Courthouse (Iowa)" context: This context discusses county seats and courthouses, which are tangentially related to the claim about county seats. 8. "Old Allamakee County Courthouse (Lansing, Iowa)" context: This context also discusses county seats and courthouses, providing background information that could be indirectly relevant.
idx: [6, 1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the county seat of the Massachusetts county for which the engineer who built Bartlett's Bridge worked. 1. "Bartlett's Bridge" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Bartlett's Bridge and the engineer Charles A. Allen, who worked for the city of Worcester at the time of the bridge's construction. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Worcester, Massachusetts" context: This context is relevant because it identifies Worcester as the county seat of Worcester County, which is directly related to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Old Allamakee County Courthouse (Lansing, Iowa)" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a courthouse in Iowa, not Massachusetts, and does not mention the engineer or the bridge. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Cerro Gordo County Courthouse (Iowa)" context: This context is also less relevant because it discusses a courthouse in Iowa, not Massachusetts, and does not mention the engineer or the bridge. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 5. "Eisenhower Bridge (Milton, Iowa)" context: This context is informative about a bridge in Iowa but does not relate to the claim about the engineer or the county seat in Massachusetts. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 6. "Henry Covered Bridge (Ohio)" context: This context is about a bridge in Ohio and does not mention the engineer or the county seat in Massachusetts. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 7. "Shinn Covered Bridge" context: This context is about a bridge in Ohio and does not mention the engineer or the county seat in Massachusetts. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 8. "Sutliff Bridge" context: This context is about a bridge in Iowa and does not mention the engineer or the county seat in Massachusetts. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [6, 1, 8, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the county seat of the Massachusetts county for which the engineer who built Bartlett's Bridge worked. 1. Context from "Bartlett's Bridge": This context is highly relevant as it mentions the bridge and the engineer, Charles A. Allen, who worked for the city of Worcester at the time. Since Worcester is the county seat of Worcester County, this context is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context from "Worcester, Massachusetts": This context is relevant because it confirms that Worcester is the county seat of Worcester County, which is directly related to the claim. 3. Context from "Cerro Gordo County Courthouse (Iowa)": This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a location in Iowa, not Massachusetts. 4. Context from "Old Allamakee County Courthouse (Lansing, Iowa)": Similarly, this context is about Iowa and does not pertain to the claim about Massachusetts.

G. Farrell" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions J. G. Farrell and his "Empire Trilogy," which deals with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Louis Aragon" context: While Louis Aragon was a novelist, the context does not mention his works dealing with the consequences of colonial rule, making it less likely to contain the answer. 3. "L'affiche rouge" context: This context discusses a song and poem by Louis Aragon, but it does not relate to the claim about novels on colonial rule. 4. "Les Chansons d'Aragon" context: This context is about an album focusing on Louis Aragon's poetry, not his novels, and is therefore less relevant. 5. "1985 Hong Kong electoral reform" context: This context discusses the political development in Hong Kong under British colonial rule, which is somewhat relevant but does not directly answer the claim about the novelist. 6. "Human rights in Niger" context: This context talks about human rights under French colonial rule, which is relevant to colonial rule but not directly to the claim. 7. "Mwambutsa IV of Burundi" context: This context is about a king during colonial rule, which is not directly relevant to the claim about novels. 8. "Fort Diu" context: This context discusses Portuguese colonial rule in India, which is not directly relevant to the claim. 9.

"Origins of the Sri Lankan civil war" context: This context discusses the effects of colonial rule on modern conflicts, which is relevant but not directly answering the claim.
idx: [9, 1, 0, 3, 6, 4, 5, 8]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking which novelist, J. G. Farrell or Louis Aragon, wrote about the political and human consequences of his country's colonial rule. To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim and the likelihood that they contain the answer.
1. "J. G. Farrell" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions J. G. Farrell and describes his "Empire Trilogy," which deals with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. This directly answers the claim.
2. "Louis Aragon" context: While this context mentions Louis Aragon was a novelist, it does not mention any works related to the political and human consequences of colonial rule. Therefore, it is less relevant than the J. G. Farrell context.
3. "1985 Hong Kong electoral reform" context: This context discusses the political consequences of British colonial rule in Hong Kong, which is somewhat related to the claim but does not directly answer the question about the novelist.
4. "Human rights in Niger" context: This context talks about the human consequences of French colonial rule in Niger, which is related to the claim but does not provide information about the novelist's works.

step-by-step think: 1. "J. G. Farrell" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions J. G. Farrell and describes his "Empire Trilogy," which deals with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. This directly addresses the claim and is likely to contain the answer. 2. "Louis Aragon" context: While this context mentions Louis Aragon being a novelist, it does not mention works related to the political and human consequences of colonial rule. It is less relevant than the J. G. Farrell context but still pertinent to one of the individuals mentioned in the claim. 3. "1985 Hong Kong electoral reform" context: This context is relevant to the concept of colonial rule but does not pertain to either J. G. Farrell or Louis Aragon. It is informative regarding the consequences of colonial rule in a specific region, which makes it somewhat relevant to the claim. 4. "Human rights in Niger" context: This context discusses the human rights situation under French colonial rule in Niger, which is related to the broader topic of colonial rule but does not directly address the claim about the novelists or their works.

golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: The claim is about Haruki Murakami's statement regarding "Dance Dance Dance" being a healing act after the fame from a novel published in a specific year. The most relevant context will be the one that mentions "Dance Dance Dance," Murakami's feelings about writing it, and the novel that brought him fame before "Dance Dance Dance" was written. 

1. Context idx 2: This context is directly relevant as it mentions "Dance Dance Dance," Murakami's statement about the novel being a healing act, and it specifies "Norwegian Wood" as the novel that brought him fame, which was published in 1987. This context is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 3: This context is relevant because it mentions "Norwegian Wood," the novel that brought Murakami fame, and its publication year, which is crucial to answering the claim.
3. Context idx 0: This context is somewhat relevant as it provides background on Murakami's earlier works and their publication dates, which could help establish a timeline leading up to "Dance Dance Dance."

step-by-step think: The claim is about Haruki Murakami's statement regarding "Dance Dance Dance" being a healing act after the fame from a novel published in a specific year. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions "Dance Dance Dance," "Norwegian Wood," and the publication year of the latter, as this is the novel that brought Murakami unexpected fame. 1. Context 2 is the most relevant as it directly mentions "Dance Dance Dance," "Norwegian Wood," and the publication year of "Norwegian Wood," which is 1987. 2. Context 3 is the second most relevant because it mentions "Norwegian Wood" and its publication year. 3.

It is informative about Murakami's works but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a different novel and does not mention "Norwegian Wood" or "Dance Dance Dance."

"Jens Risom" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Jens Risom and describes him as a Danish American furniture designer known for Mid-Century modern design, which is characterized by minimalism and functionality. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Scandinavian design" context: This context is also highly relevant because it defines Scandinavian design, which is associated with simplicity, minimalism, and functionality, attributes that are part of the claim. It is likely to contain further information on the design type introduced by Jens Risom. 3. "Functionality doctrine" context: While this context discusses functionality, it is in the context of trademark law, not design. It is less relevant than the first two but still contains useful information about the concept of functionality. 4. "Jacqueline Winsor" context: This context mentions minimalism and functionality in the realm of sculpture and art, which could be tangentially related to the claim about Jens Risom's design. However, it is less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim.
idx: [3, 7, 1, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. "Jens Risom" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Jens Risom and describes him as an exemplar of Mid-Century modern design, which is characterized by minimalism and functionality. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Scandinavian design" context: This context is also highly relevant because it defines Scandinavian design, which Jens Risom introduced in the United States, and is characterized by the same features mentioned in the claim: simplicity, minimalism, and functionality. 3. "Functionality doctrine" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses the functionality doctrine in U.S. trademark law, which is not directly related to Jens Risom or design movements. However, it does mention functionality, which is a part of the claim. 4. "Jacqueline Winsor" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a different designer and her work, which, while related to minimalism, does not directly address the claim about Jens Risom.

Question:Which of the movie which has Rich Lee 3-D previsualizations was directed by Francis Lawrence?
golden idx: [3, 5]
# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the context that directly mentions Rich Lee and his work on 3-D previsualizations, as this is central to the claim. Context 3 is the most relevant because it mentions Rich Lee's work on 3-D previsualizations for big budget films and lists "I Am Legend" as one of those films, which was directed by Francis Lawrence. Next, I look for contexts that mention films directed by Francis Lawrence, as these are also highly relevant to the claim. Contexts 1, 5, 7, and 9 mention films directed by Francis Lawrence, but do not mention Rich Lee's involvement. Context 8 is relevant as it mentions Francis Lawrence directed three films in "The Hunger Games" series, which could include work by Rich Lee. Contexts 2 and 4 mention music videos directed by Francis Lawrence, which are less relevant to the claim about movies. Context 0 is the least relevant as it does not mention any specific work by Francis Lawrence or Rich Lee.
# idx: [3,1,5,7,9,8,2,4]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about Rich Lee's 3-D previsualizations and Francis Lawrence's directorial work. 1. "Constantine (film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Rich Lee's work on 3-D previsualizations and the film being directed by Francis Lawrence. It directly connects both individuals with the specific work mentioned in the claim. 2. "Rich Lee" context: It provides a detailed background on Rich Lee, including his work on 3-D previsualizations for films, which is relevant to the claim. However, it does not directly link his work to Francis Lawrence, making it slightly less relevant than the "Constantine" context. 3. "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1" context: This context is relevant as it is a film directed by Francis Lawrence. It may contain information about the crew who worked on the film, potentially including Rich Lee. 4. "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2" context: Similar to the previous context, this film is also directed by Francis Lawrence and may contain information about Rich Lee's involvement. The other contexts are less relevant as they either mention Francis Lawrence's work on projects unrelated to Rich Lee's 3-D previsualizations or do not mention Francis Lawrence at all.
idx: [5, 3, 1, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Constantine (film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both Francis Lawrence as the director and "Constantine" as a film that Rich Lee worked on, providing 3-D previsualizations. It directly connects the director with the work of Rich Lee, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Rich Lee" context: This context provides background information on Rich Lee and mentions his work on "Constantine", linking him to the film directed by Francis Lawrence. It is informative and supports the connection between Rich Lee's work and Francis Lawrence's film, although it does not directly answer the claim. 3. "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a movie directed by Francis Lawrence but does not mention Rich Lee or his work on 3-D previsualizations, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts. 4. "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2" context: Similar to the previous context, this one also mentions a movie directed by Francis Lawrence but lacks any mention of Rich Lee or his 3-D work, placing it lower in relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

It provides historical and functional information about the Astrodome, making it highly relevant and informative. 2. Context 4 discusses the term "Eighth Wonder of the World" and its application to various structures, which is directly relevant to the claim. 3. Context 5 details the first season of the Houston Astros in the Astrodome, which contributes to its historical significance. 4. Context 0, while not directly about the claim, mentions the Astrodome and a cultural event (film) associated with it. 5. Context 1 talks about a significant event, the last concert at the Astrodome, adding to its historical importance. 6. Context 2 also discusses a major event, Selena's last concert, which contributes to the Astrodome's legacy. 7. Context 6 mentions the Astrodome in the context of the Houston Texans/Shreveport Steamer, which is less directly related to the claim. 8. Context 7 provides information about a player and the first pro football game in the Astrodome, which is relevant but less so than other contexts. Contexts 3 and 8 are not included in the top 8 as they are the least relevant to the claim.
idx: [9, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Astrodome" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the Houston Astrodome and mentions its nickname "Eighth Wonder of the World," directly addressing the claim. It provides historical and functional information about the Astrodome, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Eighth Wonder of the World" context: This context is relevant because it explains the concept of the "Eighth Wonder of the World," which is essential to understanding why the Astrodome might be called that. It is likely to contain criteria that could subjectively qualify the Astrodome for this title. 3. "For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it refers to an event that took place at the Astrodome, indicating its significance and potential reasons for its nickname. However, it may not directly contain the subjective criteria for the title. 4. "Live! The Last Concert" context: This context is relevant due to its description of a significant event at the Astrodome, which could contribute to its reputation and the claim in question. It provides details about the Astrodome's role in cultural events.
idx: [9, 4, 1, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Astrodome" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to the Houston Astrodome and provides a detailed history of the stadium, including its nickname "Eighth Wonder of the World." It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Eighth Wonder of the World" context: This context explains the concept of the "Eighth Wonder of the World," which is directly related to the claim. It provides a general definition that could help understand why the Astrodome was given this nickname. 3. "Live! The Last Concert" context: While this context is less directly related to the claim, it provides information about a significant event at the Astrodome, which contributes to its historical importance and could be a factor in its nickname. The context about George Strait's live album is informative but less directly related to the claim compared to the other contexts.

Question:Who was born first, José Echegaray y Eizaguirre or P. J. O'Rourke?
golden idx: [0, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between José Echegaray y Eizaguirre and P. J. O'Rourke, we need to look at the contexts that provide their birth dates. Context 0 gives P. J. O'Rourke's birth date as November 14, 1947. Context 8 gives José Echegaray y Eizaguirre's birth date as April 19, 1832. Clearly, José Echegaray y Eizaguirre was born first. The other contexts are not directly relevant to the claim since they do not provide information about the birth dates of the individuals in question. However, they might contain additional information about P. J. O'Rourke, which could be useful for a more comprehensive understanding of the claim. Therefore, contexts related to P. J. O'Rourke will be ranked next, followed by the remaining contexts which are less relevant.
idx: [8,0,6,7,9,1,2,4]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between José Echegaray y Eizaguirre and P. J. O'Rourke, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the birth dates of these individuals. 1. "José Echegaray" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth and death dates of José Echegaray y Eizaguirre, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. "P. J. O'Rourke" context: This context is equally important because it gives the birth date of P. J. O'Rourke, allowing us to compare the two dates to determine who was born first. 3. "Patricio Echegaray" context: Although this context mentions a different Echegaray, it is not relevant to the claim since it does not pertain to José Echegaray y Eizaguirre. 4. "Paddy O'Rourke (Meath footballer)" context: Similar to the previous context, this one is about a different O'Rourke and does not provide information about P. J. O'Rourke's birth date. The remaining contexts are about works associated with P. J. O'Rourke and do not provide information about his birth date, making them less relevant to the claim.
idx: [8, 0, 2, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "José Echegaray" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth and death dates of José Echegaray y Eizaguirre, directly addressing the claim about who was born first. 2. "P. J. O'Rourke" context: This context is also highly relevant because it gives the birth date of P. J. O'Rourke, which is necessary to answer the claim. 3. "Patricio Echegaray" context: While this context mentions another individual with the surname Echegaray, it is not directly relevant to the claim since it does not pertain to José Echegaray y Eizaguirre or his birth date. 4. "Paddy O'Rourke (Meath footballer)" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a different person with the surname O'Rourke who is not related to the claim.

golden idx: [5, 6]
# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, the informativeness of the context, and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim is about the 1994 FA Women's Cup Final held at Glanford Park and the opponent of Doncaster Belles in that match.
1. Context idx 6: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the 1994 FA Women's Cup Final, the teams involved, and the location, Glanford Park. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 7: This context is about Doncaster Rovers Belles L.F.C., which is relevant to the claim as it involves the team in question, but it does not mention the specific 1994 final.
3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a different FA Women's Cup Final involving Doncaster Belles, which makes it somewhat relevant, but less so than the context that mentions the specific year in question.
4. Context idx 9: Similar to idx 4, this context is about a different year's final with Doncaster Belles, providing some relevance.
5. Context idx 0: This context mentions a player who played with Doncaster Belles, which provides a tangential connection to the claim.
6. Context idx 5: This context is about Glanford Park, the location of the 1994 final, which is relevant to the claim.

10. Context idx 8: This context is about the 2017 FA Women's Cup Final, which is the least relevant to the claim.
# idx: [6, 7, 4, 9, 0, 5, 1, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with index 6 is the most relevant as it directly mentions the 1994 FA Women's Cup Final, the teams involved, and the location, which is exactly what the question is asking for. 2. Context with index 5 is relevant because it provides information about Glanford Park, the venue of the 1994 final, which is directly related to the claim. 3. Context with index 7 is somewhat relevant as it talks about the Doncaster Belles, one of the teams in the 1994 final, but it does not mention the specific event in question. 4. Context with index 0 is less relevant than the previous contexts as it mentions a player associated with Doncaster Belles but does not provide information about the 1994 final. The remaining contexts are about different FA Women's Cup Finals and do not directly answer the claim.
idx: [6, 5, 7, 0]

step-by-step think:1. Context with index 6 is the most relevant as it directly mentions the 1994 FA Women's Cup Final, the teams involved, and the location, which is directly related to the claim. It is highly informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2.

It is somewhat relevant and may indirectly support the answer to the claim. 3. Context with index 5 mentions Glanford Park, the venue of the final, which is relevant to the claim. However, it does not mention the event or the teams, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to the first two contexts. The context with index 0 is the least relevant as it does not mention the 1994 FA Women's Cup Final, the teams involved, or the venue, and therefore is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the ones that mention Michael Strahan, as the question is about the team he played for. Context 3 directly mentions Michael Strahan and states he played for the New York Giants, which is the answer to the claim. Therefore, it is the most relevant and informative. Context 8 mentions Curt Menefee and Michael Strahan as co-hosts on "Fox NFL Sunday", making it the second most relevant. The remaining contexts are ranked based on their relevance to the NFL and football, as they are more likely to contain information related to the claim than those about other sports or topics.
idx: [3, 8, 1, 7, 2, 6, 5, 4]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the team with which Michael Strahan spent his entire 15-year career. Context 3 directly answers this by mentioning that Michael Strahan spent his entire career with the New York Giants. Context 8 is relevant as it mentions Curt Menefee, the host of the show where Michael Strahan is a co-host, but it does not mention Strahan's career details. Context 1 is about Ray Nitschke and his career with the Green Bay Packers, which is not relevant to the claim. Context 7 discusses Merlin Olsen's career with the Los Angeles Rams, which is also not relevant to the claim about Michael Strahan. Contexts 2, 4, 5, and 6 are about different athletes and do not provide information relevant to the claim about Michael Strahan's NFL career.
idx: [3, 8, 1, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim involves Curt Menefee, the host of the Fox network's NFL show, and Michael Strahan, who is mentioned as a co-host and former NFL player. The question specifically asks for the team with which Michael Strahan spent his entire 15-year career.

1. Context 3 ("Michael Strahan"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Michael Strahan and provides detailed information about his career, including the fact that he spent his entire 15-year career with the New York Giants. It is informative and directly answers the claim.

2. Context 8 ("Curt Menefee"): This context is relevant because it mentions Curt Menefee and identifies him as the host of the Fox network's NFL show, "Fox NFL Sunday," where Michael Strahan is one of the co-hosts. However, it does not provide information about Michael Strahan's football career or the team he played for.

3. Context 7 ("Merlin Olsen"): This context is less relevant as it discusses Merlin Olsen and his football career with the Los Angeles Rams. It does not provide information about Michael Strahan or the team he played for, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

4. Context 1 ("Ray Nitschke"): This context is the least relevant to the claim as it focuses on Ray Nitschke and his career with the Green Bay Packers. It does not mention Michael Strahan or the team he played for, therefore it is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the contexts are ranked as follows:

golden idx: [1, 4]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the context that directly mentions "Dead but Rising" and provides information about the band Volbeat, which is the band in question. This context is the most relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 1. Context idx 1: "Dead but Rising" is mentioned, but the paragraph does not provide information about the city of formation. 2. Context idx 4: This context mentions Volbeat and their formation in Copenhagen in 2001, which directly answers the claim. 3. Context idx 5: Although it mentions a Danish band formed in 2001, it is about a different band, Kashmir, and is therefore less relevant. 4. Context idx 0: This context is about Lukas Graham, another Danish band, but does not provide information about the city of formation or the year 2001. 5. Context idx 3: This context is about the band Blue Foundation and does not mention the city of formation or the year 2001. 6. Context idx 2: This context is about Claess & Willumsen, a Danish band, but does not mention the city of formation or the year 2001. 7. Context idx 6: This context is about the Danish hip hop group Suspekt and Lukas Graham, but does not mention the city of formation or the year 2001. 8. Context idx 7: This context is about a Danish language football song and does not relate to the claim about the band's formation city. 9. Context idx 8: This context is about a song by Barry Blue and does not relate to the claim. 10. Context idx 9: This context is about a Danish World Cup theme song and does not relate to the claim.
idx: [4,1,5,0,3,2,6,7]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about the song "Dead but Rising" by the Danish band formed in 2001. 1. Context idx 4 ("Volbeat"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Volbeat, the Danish band in question, and confirms their formation in Copenhagen in 2001. It is informative and directly answers the claim. 2. Context idx 1 ("Dead but Rising"): This context is relevant because it mentions the song "Dead but Rising" by Volbeat, providing information about its release but not about the formation of the band or the city. 3. Context idx 5 ("Home Dead (album)"): This context is about a different Danish band, Kashmir, and their 2001 EP. It is less relevant as it does not pertain to Volbeat or the song in question. 4. Context idx 3 ("Life of a Ghost"): This context discusses another Danish band, Blue Foundation, and is even less relevant to the claim about Volbeat and their song "Dead but Rising". The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not pertain to Volbeat or the song "Dead but Rising".
idx: [4, 1, 5, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. "Volbeat" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the band Volbeat and provides information about their formation in Copenhagen in 2001, which directly answers the claim. 2. "Dead but Rising" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the song "Dead but Rising" by Volbeat, but it does not provide information about the city of formation, which is the specific detail asked in the claim. 3. "Home Dead (album)" context: This context is about a different Danish band, Kashmir, and their 2001 EP. It is less relevant because it does not pertain to Volbeat or the song in question, but it is included due to the mention of the year 2001 and the Danish music scene. 4. "Life of a Ghost" context: This context is about the Danish band Blue Foundation and is the least relevant to the claim as it does not mention Volbeat or the song "Dead but Rising."

golden idx: [1, 5]
# step-by-step think: The claim involves identifying a man associated with an award that "Summer of the Monkeys" won, who was also a spokesman for the white sector of America. Context 1 is highly relevant as it mentions Horace Bumstead, a white man who fought for African American educational rights and was viewed as a spokesman. Context 5 is also relevant because it mentions William Allen White, an American newspaper editor and author who became a spokesman for middle America. Context 1 is ranked higher because it directly addresses the role of a spokesman for the white sector, which is more specific to the claim. Context 7, while mentioning a spokesman, is less relevant as it does not connect to the award or the book. Context 3 mentions a person known for portraits of musicians, including Arctic Monkeys, but does not relate to the claim. Context 2 is crucial as it provides information about the book "Summer of the Monkeys" and the awards it won. Context 4 mentions a white sector in a different context (lighthouse range), so it's less relevant. Context 6 is not relevant to the claim. Context 8 mentions a spokesman for the Special Olympics, which is unrelated to the claim. Context 9 is also unrelated as it discusses a record producer's achievements.

It provides information about his role as a newspaper editor, politician, author, and leader of the Progressive movement, and states that he became a spokesman for middle America. 2.

However, it does mention a spokesman, which might be tangentially related to the claim. 4. "Curtis Glencross" context: This context mentions Curtis Glencross as a spokesman for the Special Olympics, which is not directly related to the claim but includes the role of a spokesman, which is a part of the claim. The other contexts are not relevant as they do not mention the award, the book, or any spokesman role related to the white sector of America.

Question:In which county is the English king Harold Godwinson buried?
golden idx: [8, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts for the claim regarding the burial location of English King Harold Godwinson, I will evaluate each context based on its direct mention of Harold Godwinson, any reference to his burial, and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 

1. Context idx 9: This context directly mentions a journey by Edith the Fair from Waltham Abbey, where Harold Godwinson is said to be buried, to the site of the Battle of Hastings. This context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 8: Waltham Abbey Church is mentioned as the parish church of the town of Waltham Abbey, which is a significant clue since it is related to the burial site mentioned in context idx 9. This context is informative and relevant.
3. Context idx 3: This context talks about Edith the Fair, the first wife of King Harold Godwinson. While it does not directly mention the burial, it is closely related to Harold and could contain relevant information.
4. Context idx 4: This context discusses cultural depictions of Harold Godwinson, which might indirectly mention his burial place through historical fiction or plays.
5. Context idx 1: The Battle of Stamford Bridge involved King Harold Godwinson, and while it does not directly mention his burial, it is a significant event in his life that could lead to information about his death and burial.
6. Context idx 7: This context is about a historical novel that covers the time of the Battle of Hastings and Harold Godwinson. It may contain fictionalized details about his burial.
7. Context idx 0: This context mentions Leofwine Godwinson, a brother of King Harold, which is tangentially related but less likely to contain information about Harold's burial.
8. Context idx 2: This context talks about Godwin, Earl of Wessex, Harold's father. It is relevant to Harold's family background but less likely to contain information about his burial.

The remaining contexts are less likely to contain the answer to the claim as they are more distantly related to Harold Godwinson or do not mention him directly.

idx: [9, 8, 3, 4, 1, 7, 0, 2]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about King Harold Godwinson's burial place and their likelihood of containing the answer:

Question:Which game was released first, Icehouse pieces or Kill Doctor Lucky?
golden idx: [5, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine which game was released first, we need to focus on the contexts that provide specific information about the release dates of "Icehouse pieces" and "Kill Doctor Lucky." Context 6 mentions that Icehouse pieces were invented in 1987. Context 5 provides information about "Kill Doctor Lucky," stating it was released in 1996. Therefore, these two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the release dates of the games. The other contexts are related to the band Icehouse and their songs or albums, which are not relevant to the claim. Context 8, which is about Marvel Comics characters, is also not relevant to the claim.

idx: [6, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7]

step-by-step think: To determine which game was released first, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the games mentioned in the question. 1. "Icehouse pieces" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the creation date of the Icehouse pieces game system, which is directly related to the claim. 2. "Kill Doctor Lucky" context: This context is also highly relevant because it gives the release year of the game "Kill Doctor Lucky," which is necessary to answer the claim. 3. "Treehouse (game)" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses a game that uses Icehouse pieces, but it does not provide a release date for the original Icehouse game. 4. "No Promises (Icehouse song)" context: This context is less relevant because it discusses a song by the band Icehouse, which shares a name with the game but is unrelated to the claim. The other contexts are about songs and are not relevant to the games in question.
idx: [6, 5, 1, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. "Icehouse pieces" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the invention year of the Icehouse game system, which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Kill Doctor Lucky" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions the release year of the "Kill Doctor Lucky" game, which is necessary to answer the claim. It is informative and directly addresses the claim. 3. "Treehouse (game)" context: This context is relevant as it discusses a game that uses Icehouse pieces, indicating a connection to the "Icehouse pieces" context and potentially providing additional information on the timeline of the Icehouse game system's usage. However, it is less directly related to the claim than the contexts that provide specific release years.

However, it is included because it discusses a radio station's location within a shopping mall, which is somewhat related to the claim. 4. "Mall of Georgia" context: This context is included as it provides information about the size of another large shopping mall, which could be useful for comparison, but it is not directly related to the claim.

golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim specifically mentions the VMAQT-1 logo and a female spirit in Irish mythology known for heralding death. Therefore, the most relevant context will be the one that directly mentions both the VMAQT-1 and the associated Irish mythological figure. 1. "VMAQT-1" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the VMAQT-1 and identifies the Banshee as its logo, which is the Irish mythological figure in question. It is highly informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2.

It provides detailed information about the Banshee, making it likely to contain the answer. 3.

"Al Basty" context: This context is about a female spirit but not related to Irish mythology; it is less relevant than the contexts directly related to the claim. 5. "Picobrouwerij Alvinne" context: This context mentions a brewery with a logo derived from a female spirit of local folk tales, which is less relevant to the claim but still mentions a logo associated with a spirit. 6. "Likhoradka" context: This context is about a Slavic female spirit, which is not relevant to the claim about Irish mythology. 7. "Pramlocha" context: This context is about a Hindu female spirit, which is not relevant to the claim about Irish mythology. 8.

The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not pertain to Irish mythology or the VMAQT-1.
idx: [6, 3, 1, 0, 2, 4, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the VMAQT-1 logo, which is a female spirit in Irish mythology known as the Banshee. The Banshee is said to herald death. Therefore, the contexts that directly relate to the VMAQT-1 and the Banshee are most relevant.
1. Context idx 6: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the VMAQT-1 and describes its logo as the Banshee, which is the exact answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 3: This context is also highly relevant because it provides detailed information about the Banshee, the female spirit in question, and its role in Irish mythology.
3. Context idx 1: This context talks about the Fomorians, which are a different supernatural race in Irish mythology. It is less relevant than the contexts that directly mention the Banshee but still related to Irish mythology.
4. Context idx 0: This context discusses Al Basty, a female spirit from a different mythology, which is less relevant to the claim about the Banshee in Irish mythology.
5. Context idx 2: This context is about a brewery that uses a female spirit in its logo, which is not directly related to the claim.

It is informative and directly related to the claim. 3. "Fomorians" context: While this context is about Irish mythology, it does not directly relate to the claim about the VMAQT-1 logo or the banshee. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to the first two contexts. 4.

The context that mentions the film "Dead at 17" which stars both Barbara Niven and John Bregar, and is a 2008 film, is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. Other contexts that mention films from around 2008 or actors who have worked with Barbara Niven or John Bregar will be considered next, as they may contain indirect information related to the claim. Contexts that do not mention any of the films, actors, or years relevant to the claim will be ranked lower as they are less likely to contain the answer.
# idx: [5,0,7,4,1,2,3,6]

"Sebastián Mantilla" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Barbara Niven, John Bregar, or a 2008 film they starred in together.
idx: [5, 0, 7, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "Dead at 17" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both Barbara Niven and John Bregar, who are central to the claim. It also specifies that the film was directed by Douglas Jackson, directly answering the question posed in the claim. 2. "Barbara Niven" context: This context is relevant because it confirms Barbara Niven's role in "A Perfect Ending," which is part of the claim. However, it does not provide information about the 2008 film or the director, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to the "Dead at 17" context. 3. "Steve Arbuckle" context: This context mentions John Bregar and provides information about another actor, Steve Arbuckle, but it does not mention Barbara Niven or the 2008 film in question, making it less relevant. 4.

"Fireflight" context: This context clearly states that Fireflight is an American band, which is crucial to answering the claim but ranks lower because the claim is about identifying the English band.
idx: [3, 8, 7, 0, 6, 4, 1, 5]

"Fireflight" context: This context is relevant as it identifies Fireflight as an American band, which helps to distinguish it from Dirty Pretty Things in terms of origin. 5.

It provides detailed information about the band's formation, members, and activities, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

It provides additional information about his role in the band and his nationality, which is pertinent to the claim. 3. "Didz Hammond" context: This context is relevant as it talks about Didz Hammond, another member of Dirty Pretty Things, and his English nationality. It is informative and supports the answer to the claim. 4. "Fireflight" context: This context is the least relevant because it mentions that Fireflight is an American band, which does not answer the claim about which band is from England.

"Viaport Rotterdam" context: This context is highly relevant as it details the ownership changes of Viaport Rotterdam, mentioning multiple owners over the years. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Wilton Mall" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses the ownership of Wilton Mall, mentioning that it was purchased from Wilmorite Properties by Macerich in 2004. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Saratoga Mall" context: While this context mentions a mall in Wilton, it is about Saratoga Mall, not Wilton Mall. However, it could be informative due to the proximity and potential confusion between the two malls. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts that directly mention Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam. 4. "Karcher Mall" context: This context is informative about the Karcher Mall's ownership but is not relevant to the claim about Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam. 5.

step-by-step think: To determine which mall, Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam, has had more owners, I will analyze the provided contexts for mentions of ownership changes. 1. "Viaport Rotterdam" context: This context is highly relevant as it details the ownership history of Viaport Rotterdam, mentioning multiple ownership changes from Wilmorite Properties to The Macerich Company, then to Kohan Retail Investment Group, and finally to Via Properties, which also renamed the mall. 2. "Wilton Mall" context: This context is also relevant as it mentions that Wilton Mall was purchased by Macerich from Wilmorite Properties in 2004. However, it does not mention multiple ownership changes like the Viaport Rotterdam context does. 3. "Saratoga Mall" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different mall that was demolished and does not provide information about the ownership history of either Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam. 4. The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they discuss different malls with no connection to Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam.

"Viaport Rotterdam" context: This context is highly relevant as it details the ownership history of Viaport Rotterdam, mentioning it was owned by Wilmorite Properties, then The Macerich Company, followed by Kohan Retail Investment Group, and finally Via Properties. This indicates four distinct ownership periods. 2. "Wilton Mall" context: This context is also relevant as it mentions that Wilton Mall was owned by Wilmorite Properties and then by Macerich. This indicates two distinct ownership periods. 3. "Saratoga Mall" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not provide information about the current malls in question. 4. "Karcher Mall" context: This context is not relevant to the claim since it does not pertain to either Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam.

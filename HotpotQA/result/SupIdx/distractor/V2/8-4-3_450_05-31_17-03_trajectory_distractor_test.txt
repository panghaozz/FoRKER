1. Context idx 8 is the most relevant because it directly mentions the Battle of Great Bridge, which led to the departure of Royal Governor Lord Dunmore, directly answering the claim.
2. Context idx 7 is the second most relevant as it details the actions of the 1st Virginia Regiment, including the Battle of Great Bridge.
3. Context idx 4 mentions the 1st Virginia State Regiment, which is not the same as the 1st Virginia Regiment but is related and discusses actions during the Revolutionary War.
4. Context idx 0 mentions the 5th Virginia Regiment, which is not directly related to the 1st Virginia Regiment but shares the context of the Revolutionary War.
5. Context idx 2 mentions the 12th Virginia Regiment, which, like the 5th, is not the 1st Virginia Regiment but is involved in similar battles.
6. Context idx 3 details the 3rd Virginia Regiment's actions, which are not directly related to the 1st Virginia Regiment but are part of the same war.
7. Context idx 5 discusses the 7th Virginia Regiment, which shares the context of the Revolutionary War.
8. Context idx 9 talks about the 4th Virginia Regiment, which, while not the 1st Virginia Regiment, is involved in the same conflict.

idx: [8, 7, 4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. "Battle of Great Bridge" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the Battle of Great Bridge and the departure of Royal Governor Lord Dunmore, which is the answer to the claim. 2.

"1st Virginia State Regiment" context: While this context discusses the 1st Virginia State Regiment and its actions, it does not directly mention the Battle of Great Bridge or the departure of the Royal Governor, making it less relevant than the previous contexts. 4. "5th Virginia Regiment" context: This context is informative about the 5th Virginia Regiment but does not mention the Battle of Great Bridge or the departure of the Royal Governor, making it less relevant to the claim. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not directly address the claim or the departure of the Royal Governor.
idx: [8, 7, 4, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. Context index 8 ("Battle of Great Bridge") is the most relevant as it directly mentions the Battle of Great Bridge and the departure of Royal Governor Lord Dunmore, which is the specific event the question is asking about. 2.

2. Context idx 7: This context is about the telenovela "Graduados", which was broadcast in the correct time frame and is likely to contain the answer.
3. Context idx 1: This context mentions Isabel Macedo as a star but the telenovela is from 2014, which does not match the claim's time frame.
4. Context idx 2: This context mentions Isabel Macedo but the telenovela is from 2006, which is outside the claim's time frame.

Based on the above evaluation, the top 8 ranked contexts based on their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim are:
idx: [3, 7, 1, 2, 4, 9, 0, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "Graduados" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the telenovela "Graduados" broadcast by Telefe within the specified dates and is likely to contain the answer about the character Jimena Benitez played by Isabel Macedo. 2. "Patricia Longo" context: This context is directly related to the claim, mentioning the character Jimena Benitez and the actress Isabel Macedo in the telenovela "Graduados". 3. "Guapas" context: This context mentions Isabel Macedo as a star in another telenovela, but it is from 2014, which is outside the claim's date range. 4. "Amar después de amar" context: This context also mentions Isabel Macedo in a leading role, but the telenovela is from 2017, making it less relevant to the claim.

Context idx 9: This context mentions Isabel Macedo in a different telenovela, "Amar después de amar," which is not relevant to the claim.

Question:What was position of the man who served Prince Andrew from 1990-2001? 
golden idx: [7, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about the position of the man who served Prince Andrew from 1990-2001. 1. Context 9 directly answers the claim by mentioning Captain Robert Neil Blair as the Private Secretary and Treasurer to The Duke of York during the specified years. 2. Context 7 provides information about Prince Andrew, Duke of York, which is relevant but does not directly answer the claim about the position of his servant. 3. Context 5 mentions cocktails invented in honor of Prince Andrew among others, indicating relevance but not directly answering the claim. 4.

Context 2 mentions Prince Andrew in a genealogical context, which is less relevant to the claim. 8.

Contexts 0 and 3 are not relevant as they do not pertain to Prince Andrew or the timeframe of 1990-2001.
idx: [9,7,5,6,8,4,2,1]

step-by-step think: 1. Context from 'Neil Blair': This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Captain Robert Neil Blair as the Private Secretary and Treasurer to The Duke of York during the exact years in question, 1990–2001. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

Question:Are Agee and To Shoot an Elephant both documentaries about war?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider their relevance to the claim about whether "Agee" and "To Shoot an Elephant" are both documentaries about war. 1. "To Shoot an Elephant" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "To Shoot an Elephant" and confirms it is a documentary about the Gaza War. 2. "Agee (film)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions "Agee" and confirms it is a documentary, although it does not specify if it's about war. 3. "Marcel Trillat" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions documentaries about war, but does not directly relate to "Agee" or "To Shoot an Elephant". 4. "Hannibal Brooks" context: This context is less relevant as it is about a war comedy film, not a documentary, and does not relate to the claim. 5. "Khan Kluay" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about an animated film, not a documentary about war. 6. "Elephant Pass railway station" context: This context is not relevant; it mentions a railway station affected by civil war but is unrelated to the documentaries in question. 7. "James Howard Williams" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a person known for his work with elephants during World War II, not a documentary. 8. "North African elephant" context: This context is not relevant; it discusses war elephants in history, not documentaries. 9. "Carlos Rendón Zipagauta" context: This context is not relevant as it discusses a filmmaker's work but not the documentaries in question. 10. "Surus" context: This context is not relevant; it discusses a historical war elephant, not documentaries.
idx: [3, 6, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "To Shoot an Elephant" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that 'To Shoot an Elephant' is indeed a documentary about the Gaza War, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Agee (film)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it confirms that 'Agee' is a documentary, although it is about the writer James Agee and not specifically about war, it still partially addresses the claim. 3. "Marcel Trillat" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions documentaries about wars, such as the Algerian War and the Gulf War, which could potentially lead to confusion with the documentaries in question. 4. "North African elephant" context: This context is tangentially related due to the mention of war elephants used in the Punic Wars, but it does not directly address the claim about the documentaries. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not discuss documentaries about war.
idx: [3, 6, 4, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "To Shoot an Elephant" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to the claim, mentioning "To Shoot an Elephant" as a documentary about the Gaza War, which is a war-related subject. 2. "Agee (film)" context: This context is relevant because it mentions "Agee" as a documentary film, but it does not specify that it's about war, rather it's about the writer James Agee. However, since the claim is about whether both are documentaries about war, its relevance is slightly lower. 3. "Marcel Trillat" context: This context mentions documentaries about wars, such as the Algerian War and the Gulf War, which makes it somewhat relevant to the claim. However, it does not directly relate to either "Agee" or "To Shoot an Elephant," so its score is lower. 4. "North African elephant" context: Although this context mentions war elephants used by Carthage in the Punic Wars, it is not about a documentary film and is therefore not relevant to the claim about whether "Agee" and "To Shoot an Elephant" are both documentaries about war.

"Flatwood" context: This context mentions a shallow water table in relation to soil series, but it is not specific to Keith County, Nebraska.
idx: [6, 7, 4, 8, 0, 9, 3, 5]

"Ogallala Aquifer" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Ogallala Aquifer as a shallow water table aquifer and states that it is named after the town of Ogallala, Nebraska, which is the county seat of Keith County. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts. 4.

However, it is less directly related to the claim than the other contexts.

step-by-step think:1. "Ogallala Aquifer" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Ogallala Aquifer, which is a shallow water table aquifer and is located near Ogallala, Nebraska, the county seat of Keith County. It provides extensive information about the aquifer, including its location and significance. 2.

"Kingsley Dam" context: While this context is informative about a location in Keith County, it does not mention the aquifer or its relation to the county seat, making it less relevant to the claim.

Question:Who was born first Mahbub ul Haq or Ibn Arabi?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Mahbub ul Haq and Ibn Arabi, the contexts that directly mention their birth dates are most relevant. 1. "Ibn Arabi" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth date of Ibn Arabi, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. "Mahbub ul Haq" context: Similarly, this context is also highly relevant because it gives the specific birth date of Mahbub ul Haq. 3. "Journal of Human Development and Capabilities" context: This context mentions Mahbub ul Haq and is somewhat relevant, but it does not provide his birth date. 4. "Human Development Index" context: This context is related to Mahbub ul Haq's work and is informative but less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that provide birth dates. 5. "Akbariyya" context: This context discusses Ibn Arabi's teachings and is relevant to his life but does not provide his birth date. 6. "Fazle Hasan Abed" context: This context mentions an award named after Mahbub ul Haq, indicating some relevance, but it is not directly related to the claim. 7. "Inge Kaul" context: This context is indirectly related through the association with Mahbub ul Haq's work but does not provide information on his birth date. 8. "Idrees Ul Haq" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not provide information about either individual mentioned in the claim.
idx: [6, 4, 1, 9, 3, 2, 8, 0]

step-by-step think: The claim asks who was born first between Mahbub ul Haq and Ibn Arabi. To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer.
1. "Ibn Arabi" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth and death dates of Ibn Arabi, directly answering part of the claim. It is likely to contain the answer to who was born first.
2. "Mahbub ul Haq" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides the birth and death dates of Mahbub ul Haq, which is necessary to compare with Ibn Arabi's dates to answer the claim.
3. "Akbariyya" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the teachings of Ibn Arabi and mentions his nickname and lifespan, which can help infer the time period he was born in.
4. "Human Development Index" context: This context mentions Mahbub ul Haq in relation to the development of the HDI, which is less directly related to the claim but still provides information about Mahbub ul Haq's contributions and relevance.
The other contexts are informative but less directly related to the birth dates of the individuals in question, making them lower in relevance for this specific claim.

idx: [6, 4, 3, 9]

step-by-step think:1. "Ibn Arabi" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth and death dates of Ibn Arabi, which are crucial to determining who was born first. 2. "Mahbub ul Haq" context: This context is also highly relevant because it gives the specific birth and death dates of Mahbub ul Haq, allowing for a direct comparison with Ibn Arabi's dates. 3. "Akbariyya" context: While this context is about the branch of Sufi metaphysics based on Ibn Arabi's teachings, it also mentions his nickname and lifespan, which adds some relevance to the claim. 4. "Human Development Index" context: This context mentions Mahbub ul Haq in relation to the development of the HDI but does not provide information relevant to the claim about birth dates.

golden idx: [2, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is seeking information about tales associated with the goddess Frigg. Contexts that directly mention Frigg and her tales, or those closely related to her, should be ranked higher.

8. "Norse mythology" context: This context provides a broad overview of Norse mythology, which includes tales of various deities, including potentially Frigg.

"Hlín" context: This context is relevant as it discusses Hlín, who is associated with Frigg and may be another name for her. It could contain tales involving Frigg. 4. "Eir" context: This context is relevant as it theorizes Eir as a form of Frigg and discusses her role in Norse mythology. It may contain tales involving Frigg. 5. "Nanna (Norse deity)" context: This context is less directly related to Frigg but mentions Nanna giving gifts to Frigg, which could be part of a tale. 6. "Sága and Sökkvabekkr" context: This context is relevant as it suggests Sága may be another name for Frigg and discusses a location that may be connected to her.

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for tales associated with the goddess Frigg. 1. "Fensalir" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the location where the goddess Frigg dwells and is directly related to Norse mythology. It is likely to contain tales or information about the goddess. 2. "Fulla" context: This context is also relevant because it describes Fulla, a goddess associated with Frigg, and mentions that Frigg confides in her, indicating a close relationship that could be explored in tales. 3. "Hlín" context: This context mentions Hlín as a goddess associated with Frigg and suggests that Hlín might be another name for Frigg, which could imply that tales involving Hlín are actually about Frigg. 4. "Eir" context: While this context mentions Eir as a goddess possibly associated with Frigg, it focuses more on Eir's role in medical skill and less on the narrative tales of Frigg.

10. Context idx 8: This context is about William Street, named after William Pery, but it does not provide information relevant to the claim about the Yeomen of the Guard.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer, the top 8 ranked contexts are:

idx: [1, 7, 9, 3]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the position held by the lord under whom William Pery served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1865 to 1868. 1. "Henry Cadogan, 4th Earl Cadogan" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Henry Cadogan serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard between 1866 and 1868, which overlaps with the time frame in the claim.

step-by-step think: The claim is about the location where the 1956 Night Series Cup games were played, specifically asking for the inner suburb of Melbourne that is 3km south of Melbourne's central business district. To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the 1956 Night Series Cup and the mention of the specific location in relation to Melbourne's CBD.

2. Context idx 3: This context is about **Albert Park, Victoria**, and it states that it is an inner suburb of Melbourne, 3 km south of Melbourne's central business district. It directly answers the claim, making it highly relevant.
3. Context idx 1: The **1957 Night Series Cup** context mentions games played at the Lake Oval, Albert Park, which is relevant to the claim but less so than the direct mention of the 1956 cup.
4. Context idx 0: The **1961 Night Series Cup** context also mentions games played at the Lake Oval, Albert Park. It is relevant as it discusses the location but is for a different year.
5. Context idx 2: The **1967 Golden Fleece Cup** context mentions the location but is less relevant than the contexts directly related to the 1956 cup.
6. Context idx 6: The **1960 Night Series Cup** context is relevant as it mentions the location, but again, it is for a different year.
7. Context idx 8: The **1958 Night Series Cup** context mentions the location and is somewhat relevant to the claim.
8. Context idx 7: The **1965 Golden Fleece Cup** context mentions the location but is less directly related to the claim than the others.

The remaining contexts (idx 5 and 9) are less relevant because they do not mention the 1956 Night Series Cup or the specific location in relation to Melbourne's CBD.
idx: [4, 3, 1, 0, 2, 6, 8, 7]

step-by-step think: 1.

It confirms the location's proximity to Melbourne's central business district, which is essential for answering the claim. 3. Context idx 1: This context talks about the 1957 Night Series Cup, which followed the 1956 Cup. It mentions games played at Lake Oval, Albert Park, providing information about the location relevant to the claim but is less directly related to the 1956 event compared to context idx 4.

golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the first instance of a game held three times in East Asia.

Context 6 also refers to the Summer Olympic Games, but it does not specify the locations or the number of times held in East Asia, making it less relevant than Context 0.

Context 3 ("Fruit Bowl"): This context is less relevant as it discusses a college football bowl game held in San Francisco, which is not in East Asia, but it mentions the event was held three times, which partially relates to the claim.
idx: [0, 6, 7, 3]

step-by-step think: 1.

It provides information on the first time the event was held for men and women, which is related to the claim but less directly than the Olympic contexts. 4. "Fruit Bowl" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a college football bowl game held in San Francisco, California, and does not pertain to the Olympic Games or events in East Asia.

It also provides information that the film was written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, which connects to Blinding Edge Pictures. 2.

Night Shyamalan, produced "Unbreakable" in 2000, directly answering the claim. 3.

It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Battle of Manila (1574)" context: This context is relevant to the claim as it mentions a Battle of Manila, but the date is much earlier (1574) and does not pertain to the claim's timeframe. 4. "Battle of Calabria" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it pertains to a different battle entirely. 5. "Battle of Yao (Japan)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it pertains to a different battle in Japan. 6.

"Battle of Manila (1945)" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the specific dates of the Battle of Manila, which are February 3, 1945, to March 3, 1945.

It is directly related to the claim and contains the answer. 3. "Battle of Manila (1574)" context: This context is about an earlier Battle of Manila, but it is not the one in question for the claim. However, it is still relevant because it mentions a Battle of Manila, just not the correct one. 4. The other contexts are about different battles that are not related to the claim, so they are not as relevant. The Battle of Calabria, Battle of Yao, Battle of Klushino, Battle of Aspromonte, and Battle of the Burbia River do not pertain to the claim and are therefore ranked lower.

"Battle of Manila (1945)" context: This context is relevant because it provides the date of another Battle of Manila, but since the claim is about the first occurrence, the 1574 battle is more pertinent. 4. "Battle of Calabria" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not pertain to either the Battle of Manila or the Battle of Guam.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider the relevance to the claim about a 2016 film starring Xavier Samuel and an actress from "Vampire Academy". Context 6 mentions a 2016 film with Xavier Samuel, which is directly relevant. Context 2 mentions Lucy Fry, who played Vasilisa Dragomir, and context 7 confirms her role in a 2016 film with Samuel. Context 8 also mentions a 2016 film with Samuel but not the actress from "Vampire Academy". Context 0 mentions Samuel but is from 2014, so it's less relevant. Context 3 is from 2013, context 4 from 2011, and context 1 and 9 are about the "Vampire Academy" series but not the film in question. Context 5 is relevant but less informative than context 6 or 7.
idx: [6, 2, 7, 8, 0, 3, 4, 1]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, the informativeness, and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim asks for a 2016 film starring Xavier Samuel and an actress from "Vampire Academy". 1. Context idx 6 ("Mr. Church") is highly relevant as it mentions a 2016 film with Xavier Samuel and Lucy Fry, who played Vasilisa Dragomir in "Vampire Academy". 2. Context idx 2 ("Lucy Fry") is relevant as it confirms Lucy Fry's role in "Vampire Academy" and mentions her involvement in other projects, indicating her active career around 2016. 3. Context idx 8 ("Love & Friendship") is relevant because it mentions a 2016 film starring Xavier Samuel. 4.

The other contexts are less relevant as they either mention different films or do not link Xavier Samuel and Lucy Fry together in a 2016 film.

step-by-step think:1. "Mr. Church" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both Xavier Samuel and Lucy Fry, who portrayed Vasilisa Dragomir in "Vampire Academy". It directly connects to the claim by listing the cast of the 2016 film "Mr. Church". 2. "Lucy Fry" context: This context provides background information on Lucy Fry, including her role as Vasilisa Dragomir in "Vampire Academy". It is relevant because it confirms Lucy Fry's involvement in the film connected to the claim. 3. "Love & Friendship" context: This context mentions Xavier Samuel as part of the cast in another 2016 film, "Love & Friendship". It is relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts that directly mention both actors in question.

"Official Ireland" context: This context is relevant because it defines "Official Ireland" and mentions the Catholic Church as one of the powerful figures, which is likely related to the claim. However, it does not provide the specific percentage, making it slightly less likely to contain the answer compared to the first context. 3. "Lord Howe Island" context: While this context mentions a group comprising several islands and talks about population distribution, it is not directly related to the claim about "Official Ireland" or the specific percentage of the population. It is less relevant and less likely to contain the answer. 4. "Booty Luv" context: This context mentions success in Ireland but is unrelated to the claim about "Official Ireland" or the population percentage. It is the least relevant and least likely to contain the answer.

Question:What Division was the college footbal team that fired their head coach on November 24, 2006?
golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim about a college football team firing their head coach on November 24, 2006. The context must be directly related to college football and the specific date mentioned in the claim to score highly.

1. Context idx 7 ("Larry Coker") is the most relevant as it directly mentions Larry Coker being fired from the University of Miami football team on the exact date in question, November 24, 2006.
2. Context idx 4 ("2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team") is relevant as it discusses the firing of a head coach from a college football team, but the date is not specified.
3. Context idx 6 ("2006 Miami Hurricanes football team") is somewhat relevant as it mentions the team for which Larry Coker was the head coach, but it does not mention the firing.
4. Context idx 3 ("2009 Virginia Cavaliers football team") is less relevant as it discusses a different team and a different year, but it is still about college football.
5. Context idx 2 ("Brian Knorr") mentions a college football coach being fired, but the date is not the one in question.
6. Context idx 0 ("Reggie Witherspoon (basketball)") and idx 1 ("Buzz Peterson") are not relevant as they are about basketball coaches, not football.
7. Context idx 5 ("Maggie Dixon Award") and idx 9 ("Holly Bruder") are not relevant as they discuss women's basketball and softball, respectively.
8. Context idx 8 ("Richard Jacob") is not relevant as it discusses a professional basketball team and a college's Sport Management program.

Based on the above evaluation, the contexts are ranked by relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

idx: [7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 0, 1, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the Division of the college football team whose head coach was fired on November 24, 2006. To rank the contexts, I will consider how directly each context relates to the claim, how informative it is, and the likelihood that it contains the answer to the claim.
1. "Larry Coker" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Larry Coker being fired from the University of Miami on the exact date in question. It is likely to contain the answer because it discusses his tenure at a specific university, which can be linked to a Division.

3. "2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team" context: This context is less relevant because it discusses the firing of a different head coach at a different university, but it is still informative as it pertains to college football head coaches being fired.
4. "Brian Knorr" context: This context is informative and mentions a head coach being fired in November, but the year does not match the claim, making it less relevant.
5. "2009 Virginia Cavaliers football team" context: This context is about a different team and a different year, making it less relevant to the claim.
6. "Buzz Peterson" context: This context is about college basketball, not football, and the firing did not occur in the year mentioned in the claim.
7. "Reggie Witherspoon (basketball)" context: This context is also about college basketball and is not relevant to the claim about college football.

It also provides information about his tenure at the university, which is directly related to the Division the football team belongs to. 2. "2006 Miami Hurricanes football team" context: This context is relevant because it specifies the team Larry Coker coached, the Miami Hurricanes, during the 2006 season. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim as it discusses the team's Division during that season. 3. "2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different team and a different head coach being fired. It is informative but less likely to contain the answer to the claim about the Miami Hurricanes' Division. 4.

Question:What produces the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron?
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking about the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron. 1. "Aldosterone" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions aldosterone, which is the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron. It provides detailed information about aldosterone's role and production. 2. "Angiotensin" context: This context is relevant because it describes how angiotensin stimulates the release of aldosterone, which is directly related to the claim. 3. "Sylvia Agnes Sophia Tait" context: This context is informative as it discusses the discovery and identification of aldosterone, which is the hormone in question. 4. "Low pressure receptors" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it talks about the regulation of aldosterone secretion, which is related to sodium retention. 5. "Distal renal tubular acidosis" context: This context is less directly related to the claim but still relevant as it discusses a condition affecting the distal nephron where aldosterone could play a role. 6. "Sodium-chloride symporter" context: This context is relevant to the claim as it discusses the reabsorption of sodium in the distal convoluted tubule, which is influenced by aldosterone. 7. "Loop of Henle" context: This context is less relevant as it describes the loop of Henle's function, which is not directly related to aldosterone but is part of the nephron. 8. "Ascending limb of loop of Henle" context: This context is also less relevant as it focuses on a specific segment of the loop of Henle, not directly on aldosterone or sodium retention. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim and are therefore not included in the top 8.
idx: [2,3,7,5,1,6,0,4]

step-by-step think: The claim asks about the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron. 1. "Aldosterone" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly discusses aldosterone, which is produced by the adrenal gland and acts on the distal nephron to promote sodium retention. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Angiotensin" context: This context is relevant because it mentions that angiotensin stimulates the release of aldosterone, which promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron. It is slightly less directly related to the claim than the "Aldosterone" context but still likely contains the answer. 3. "Sylvia Agnes Sophia Tait" context: This context is informative as it provides historical background on the discovery of aldosterone, which is related to the claim. However, it is less directly related to the hormone's function compared to the first two contexts. 4. "Low pressure receptors" context: This context mentions aldosterone in relation to blood pressure regulation and sodium retention, making it relevant to the claim. It is less direct than the "Aldosterone" and "Angiotensin" contexts but still contains useful information. The remaining contexts discuss related topics such as the loop of Henle and sodium-chloride symporter, but they do not directly address the hormone responsible for sodium retention in the distal nephron.
idx: [2, 3, 7, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "Aldosterone" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the hormone aldosterone, which is produced by the adrenal gland and promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron. It provides a comprehensive explanation of aldosterone's role and function, making it very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Angiotensin" context: This context is relevant because it mentions that angiotensin stimulates the release of aldosterone, which is the hormone in question. It is informative and supports the understanding of the relationship between angiotensin and aldosterone, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Sylvia Agnes Sophia Tait" context: This context is informative as it provides historical background on the discovery and identification of aldosterone. It is less directly related to the claim's focus on the hormone's function but still relevant to the overall topic. 4. "Low pressure receptors" context: While this context mentions aldosterone, it focuses more on the role of low pressure receptors and their effect on aldosterone secretion rather than the production of aldosterone itself. It is informative but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim compared to the other contexts.

idx: [2, 3, 9, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To determine the ranking of the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about the number of Senate seats contested in the midterm elections and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1.

Context idx 4: This context provides information about Nancy Soderberg, including her filing to run for Congress, which is directly related to the claim but does not mention the number of Senate seats.

step-by-step think: 1. "United States elections, 2018" context: This context is highly relevant as it specifies the number of Senate seats contested in the 2018 midterm elections, which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

However, it is less specific than the first context. 4. "Nancy Soderberg" context: While this context provides detailed information about Nancy Soderberg, it does not directly address the claim regarding the number of Senate seats contested in the midterm elections she filed to run in. It is informative about the candidate but not about the claim.

Earth Island Institute" context: This context mentions a different case decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court, which makes it somewhat relevant but not directly answering the claim. 4. "Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt" context: This context mentions a Supreme Court decision but with a different vote count, making it less relevant. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the cases in question or a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court.

"Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt" context: This context is about a Supreme Court case decided 5-3, which is not relevant to the claim about a 5-4 decision, making it the least likely to contain the answer.

Question:Which jazz singer has a 2003 album entitled The Boy Next Door? 
golden idx: [7, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a jazz singer with a 2003 album titled "The Boy Next Door." Context 7 directly answers the claim by stating "The Boy Next Door is a 2003 album by jazz singer Stacey Kent." Therefore, it ranks highest. Context 9 provides information about Stacey Kent, the jazz singer in question, making it the second most relevant. Context 5 mentions Stacey Kent and the album title, so it ranks third. Context 0 mentions a "Boy Next Door" song by Jamelia, which could cause confusion but is less relevant, so it ranks fourth. Context 1 talks about a novel with a similar name but is not directly related to the claim, ranking fifth. Context 2 is about an album with a similar name by a different artist, so it ranks sixth. Context 3 discusses Rick Astley's desire to move away from his "boy next door" image, which is tangentially related, ranking seventh. Context 4 defines the "boy next door" archetype, which is the least relevant to the claim but still holds some contextual relevance, ranking eighth.
idx: [7, 9, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with 'idx': 7, 'title': 'The Boy Next Door (album)', directly addresses the claim by mentioning the album and the jazz singer Stacey Kent, making it highly relevant and informative. 2. Context with 'idx': 9, 'title': 'Stacey Kent', is about the jazz singer herself, providing information that confirms her identity as the artist of the album in question. 3. Context with 'idx': 5, 'title': "'Tis Autumn", mentions the album and the singer, reinforcing the connection between Stacey Kent and the album. 4. Context with 'idx': 0, 'title': 'Superstar – The Hits', includes a mention of "Boy Next Door" but in an unrelated context, making it less relevant than the others. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the jazz singer or the album and therefore score lower in relevance and likelihood of containing the answer.
idx: [7, 9, 5, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. "The Boy Next Door (album)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the album "The Boy Next Door" and identifies Stacey Kent as the jazz singer who released it in 2003. It is very informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "'Tis Autumn" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions Stacey Kent and the album "The Boy Next Door," confirming her as the artist of the album in question. It provides additional information about the album's content. 3. "Stacey Kent" context: This context is relevant as it provides information about Stacey Kent being an American jazz singer, which is related to the claim. However, it does not mention the album directly but is likely to contain more information about her work and possibly about the album. 4. "Superstar – The Hits" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different artist and album, and does not mention Stacey Kent or her album "The Boy Next Door."

These two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. The other contexts mention various individuals and locations related to basketball but do not provide information about Anthony Avent's high school or its location relative to the claim. Therefore, they are ranked lower in relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.
idx: [5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the high school Anthony Avent attended, which is located in a city approximately 8 miles west of another location. 1.

"José Mujica" context: This context mentions José Mujica as the 40th President, but of Uruguay, not the United States. It is less relevant as it does not pertain to the claim about Reagan or Zeboski. 5.

"Bernhard Vogel (politician)" context: This context mentions the number 40 in relation to the Bundesrat, which is less relevant to the claim. 7.

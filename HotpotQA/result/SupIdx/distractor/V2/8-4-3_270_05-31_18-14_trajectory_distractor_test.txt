Question:To which aircraft carrier was the VMF-213 Marine Fighting Squadron assigned to durning World War II?
golden idx: [7, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about VMF-213's assignment during World War II. 1. Context idx 8 directly mentions VMF-213 and its assignment to the USS Essex (CV-9), making it the most relevant and informative. 2. Context idx 7 discusses the USS Essex (CV-9), which is directly related to VMF-213's assignment. 3. Context idx 5 mentions VMF-452 and its association with an aircraft carrier, which could be indirectly relevant. 4. Context idx 2 talks about VMF-512 being carrier-based, which might provide some useful comparison. 5. Context idx 1 mentions VMF-511 and its activities during WWII, which are less directly related but still relevant. 6. Context idx 4 discusses VMF-222's activities and could offer background information. 7. Context idx 6 talks about VMF-215, which might provide insight into the operations of Marine Fighting Squadrons. 8. Context idx 3 mentions VMF-236's activities, which are the least directly related to the claim but still within the context of WWII Marine squadrons.
idx: [8, 7, 5, 2, 1, 4, 6, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 8: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions VMF-213's assignment to the USS Essex (CV-9) during World War II, which is the specific information the claim is asking for. 2. Context idx 7: This context provides detailed information about the USS Essex (CV-9), the aircraft carrier to which VMF-213 was assigned. It is relevant and informative regarding the carrier's role during the war. 3. Context idx 5: While this context talks about VMF-452 and its assignment to the USS Franklin (CV-13), it is less relevant to the claim about VMF-213 but still provides useful information about Marine squadrons' assignments to carriers. 4. Context idx 1: This context discusses VMF-511's activities during World War II, which is less directly related to the claim but still provides context about Marine squadrons during the period.
idx: [8, 7, 5, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. Context from 'VMF-213': This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the VMF-213 squadron and its assignment to the USS Essex (CV-9) during World War II, which is the specific information the question is asking for. 2. Context from 'USS Essex (CV-9)': This context is relevant because it provides detailed information about the USS Essex, the aircraft carrier to which VMF-213 was assigned. It is likely to contain further details that pertain to the claim. 3. Context from 'VMF-452': While this context mentions another Marine Fighting Squadron and an aircraft carrier, it is less relevant because it does not pertain to VMF-213 but to VMF-452 and the USS Franklin (CV-13). However, it is still somewhat relevant to the topic of Marine Fighting Squadrons during World War II. 4. Context from 'VMF-511': This context is the least relevant as it does not mention the USS Essex or the specific squadron in question (VMF-213), focusing instead on VMF-511 and its activities during the war.

Question:Can Stenocereus and Pachypodium both include tree like plants?
golden idx: [4, 8]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about whether Stenocereus and Pachypodium both include tree-like plants, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the genera in question and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Stenocereus" context: This context is directly relevant as it describes the Stenocereus genus and mentions that it includes tree-like cacti, which is part of the claim. 2. "Pachypodium" context: Similarly, this context is highly relevant because it talks about the Pachypodium genus and indicates that it includes trees and shrubs, which addresses the claim. 3. "Pachypodium lealii" context: This context is about a specific species within the Pachypodium genus and describes it as a tree, which supports the claim. 4. "Durvillaea willana" context: Although this context describes a kelp species with a tree-like form, it is less directly relevant because it does not pertain to the genera in question but still mentions a tree-like structure. 5. "Coprosma repens" context: This context talks about a species that can be a small tree, which is somewhat relevant to the claim. 6. "Parkia timoriana" context: This context is about a species of flowering plant that includes the word 'tree' in its common names, but it is not about the genera in question, so it's less relevant. 7. "Our Casuarina Tree" context: This is a poem that metaphorically describes a tree, which is not directly relevant to the botanical claim about Stenocereus and Pachypodium. 8. "Davey Tree Expert Company" context: This context is about a company related to tree care and not about the plant genera in question, making it the least relevant.
idx: [4, 8, 5, 1, 7, 0, 3, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim asks whether both Stenocereus and Pachypodium can include tree-like plants. 1. "Stenocereus" context: This context is highly relevant as it describes Stenocereus as a genus of tree-like cacti, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Pachypodium" context: This context is equally relevant because it describes Pachypodium as a genus of succulent spine-bearing trees and shrubs, addressing the other half of the claim. 3. "Pachypodium lealii" context: This context is informative as it provides details about a specific species within the Pachypodium genus, which supports the claim that Pachypodium includes tree-like plants. 4. "Coprosma repens" context: Although this context talks about a tree-like species, it is not directly related to the claim since it does not pertain to either Stenocereus or Pachypodium. However, it is more relevant than the remaining contexts because it still discusses a tree-like plant. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not discuss tree-like plants in relation to Stenocereus or Pachypodium.
idx: [4, 8, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Stenocereus" context: This context is highly relevant as it describes Stenocereus as a genus of tree-like cacti, directly addressing the claim about tree-like plants. 2. "Pachypodium" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Pachypodium as a genus of trees and shrubs, which supports the claim. 3. "Pachypodium lealii" context: While this context is about a specific species within the Pachypodium genus and mentions it as a tree, it is slightly less directly related to the claim than the general description of the genus. 4. "Coprosma repens" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different genus that is not part of the claim.

golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for a movie directed by Pitof that had an action-adventure tie-in video game released in 2004. Context 0 directly mentions "Catwoman," a film directed by Pitof in 2004, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 2 is about the "Catwoman" video game, which is an action-adventure tie-in to the 2004 film, thus also highly relevant. Contexts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 mention various video games and films, but none of these are directed by Pitof or related to the 2004 "Catwoman" film, making them less relevant. However, context 1 mentions a tie-in video game, which is slightly more relevant than the others, but still not directly answering the claim. The rest do not mention Pitof or a 2004 tie-in game, making them the least relevant.
idx: [0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Catwoman (film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 2004 film "Catwoman" directed by Pitof, which aligns directly with the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

It provides specific details about the game and its connection to the film. 3. "Tron: Evolution" context: While this context talks about an action-adventure tie-in video game, it is for a different film and therefore is less relevant to the claim. 4. "Shrek Forever After (video game)" context: This context is about an action-adventure video game based on the "Shrek" film series. It is informative but not directly relevant to the claim about Pitof's movie. The other contexts are not relevant as they do not pertain to Pitof or the specific year 2004.
idx: [0, 2, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "Catwoman (film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the film "Catwoman" directed by Pitof in 2004, which aligns with the claim. It provides detailed information about the film, including the director's name, production details, and cast, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Catwoman (video game)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses the action-adventure tie-in video game based on the 2004 "Catwoman" film. It confirms the existence of the video game and its connection to the film, which is directly related to the claim. 3. "Tron: Evolution" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different video game and film, which does not match the claim regarding Pitof or the year 2004. 4. "Shrek Forever After (video game)" context: This context is the least relevant because it discusses a video game and film that are unrelated to the claim about Pitof's movie and the corresponding video game from 2004.

golden idx: [2, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the location of the studio where "First Knight" was being filmed on 16 January 1995 in relation to Windsor. Context 2 mentions that Pinewood Studios, the usual location for Bond films, was reserved for "First Knight", and an old Rolls-Royce factory at Leavesden Aerodrome was used instead. This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the filming location of "First Knight". Context 6 states that Pinewood Studios is located approximately 20 miles west of central London and 7 miles from Windsor, which is also highly relevant as it provides the specific distance from Windsor. Context 8 mentions Julia Ormond, an actress in "First Knight", but does not provide information about the filming location or its distance from Windsor, making it less relevant. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention "First Knight", its filming location, or its relation to Windsor.
idx: [2,6,8,0,1,3,4,5]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 6: This context provides the exact distance of Pinewood Studios from Windsor, which is highly relevant to the claim about the filming location of "First Knight". 2.

step-by-step think: 1. "Pinewood Studios" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the location of Pinewood Studios, which is directly related to the claim about the filming location of "First Knight" and its distance from Windsor. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

It indirectly supports the answer by mentioning why Pinewood Studios was not available for another film. 3. "Julia Ormond" context: This context mentions Julia Ormond, an actress in "First Knight," but does not provide information about the filming location or its distance from Windsor. It is less relevant and less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "BBC World News" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses the BBC World News channel and its history, which does not relate to the filming of "First Knight" or its location.

Question:Which Genus has more species Eucryphia or Lepidozamia ?
golden idx: [0, 1]
step-by-step think: The context titled "Eucryphia" directly relates to the claim as it provides specific information about the genus Eucryphia, mentioning that there are seven species. This context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. The context titled "Lepidozamia," on the other hand, also directly relates to the claim by providing specific information about the genus Lepidozamia, stating that there are two species. This context is equally relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. Since the question asks which genus has more species, both contexts are equally important for answering the question. However, since "Eucryphia" has more species than "Lepidozamia," the context with the title "Eucryphia" should be ranked higher.
idx: [0, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for a comparison between the number of species in the Eucryphia genus and the Lepidozamia genus. Context 0 provides information about the Eucryphia genus, including the number of species, which is seven. This context is highly relevant and likely contains part of the answer to the claim.

Since the claim is directly asking for a comparison of the number of species in each genus, both contexts are highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. However, context 0 is slightly more informative as it provides additional details about the species' distribution and characteristics.

Question:What type of magazine is Eugene Habecker the chairman of?
golden idx: [2, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about Eugene Habecker's chairmanship of a magazine and the likelihood of the context containing the answer. 1. "Eugene Habecker" context: This context directly mentions Eugene Habecker and his role as chairman of Christianity Today, which is the exact answer to the claim. 2. "Christianity Today" context: This context provides information about Christianity Today magazine, which is relevant to the claim since Eugene Habecker is the chairman of this magazine. 3. "Chasing Daylight (book)" context: This context mentions Eugene O'Kelly, who is an ex-chairman of a different organization, and while it is not directly related to the claim, it mentions leadership roles which might be confused with the claim. 4. "Eugene Melnyk" context: This context talks about a different Eugene who is a chairman, but not of a magazine, which could be slightly relevant but not likely to contain the answer. 5. "Edward E. Cox" context: This context discusses a person named Eugene and mentions chairmanship, but it is not related to the claim about magazines. 6. "Eugene R. Black Sr." context: This context mentions another Eugene who held a significant leadership position, but again, not related to the claim about magazines. 7. "Eugene Cross Park" context: This context is the least relevant as it talks about a park named after a person named Eugene and does not mention any magazines. 8. "Type I Rifle" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a rifle and does not mention Eugene Habecker or magazines.
idx: [7,2,3,1,0,6,4,8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Christianity Today" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Christianity Today," the magazine for which Eugene Habecker is the chairman. It provides detailed information about the magazine's background and its standing in the evangelical community. 2. "Eugene Habecker" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Eugene Habecker's role as the chairman of Christianity Today, directly linking him to the magazine in question. 3. "Eugene Melnyk" context: While this context mentions Eugene Melnyk's role as a chairman, it is not related to the magazine industry but to a sports team, making it less relevant. 4. "Eugene Cross Park" context: This context is informative and mentions a chairman, but it is related to a park and not to the magazine industry, thus it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 5. "Chasing Daylight (book)" context: This context is about a different Eugene (Eugene O'Kelly) and his book, which is not relevant to the claim about Eugene Habecker and the magazine he chairs. 6. "Eugene R. Black Sr." context: This context is about another individual with the name Eugene who was a chairman, but not related to the magazine industry. 7. "Edward E. Cox" context: This context is about a historical figure named Eugene who was a U.S. Representative and not related to the magazine industry. 8. "Type I Rifle" context: This context is completely unrelated to the claim as it discusses a rifle and has no connection to Eugene Habecker or magazines.
idx: [2, 7, 1, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Eugene Habecker" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Eugene Habecker and his role as chairman of Christianity Today, which is the type of magazine in question. It is informative and most likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Christianity Today" context: This context is relevant because it provides detailed information about Christianity Today magazine, including its evangelical Christian identity, which is directly related to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Eugene Melnyk" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses Eugene Melnyk, who is a different individual and his association with a sports franchise and business, not a magazine. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Eugene Cross Park" context: This context is the least relevant as it pertains to a park named after a different Eugene and does not mention magazines or Eugene Habecker. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

golden idx: [4, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the actor from "Flyboys" who was also nominated for an Academy Award for "127 Hours". The most relevant context will be the one that mentions both "Flyboys" and "127 Hours", as well as the actor's nomination. 
1. Context idx 7 ("Flyboys (film)") is the most relevant because it directly mentions the film "Flyboys" and the actor James Franco, who was in "127 Hours".
2. Context idx 4 ("James Franco") is highly relevant as it confirms James Franco's nomination for an Academy Award for "127 Hours".
3. Context idx 1 ("127 Hours") is relevant as it talks about the film and James Franco, but does not mention "Flyboys".
4. Context idx 0 ("List of accolades received by 127 Hours") is informative about the film's accolades and mentions James Franco, but lacks information about "Flyboys".
5. Context idx 5 ("Treat Williams") mentions "127 Hours" and another actor, Treat Williams, but does not link him to "Flyboys".
6. Context idx 6 ("Danny Boyle") provides information on the director of "127 Hours" and could be tangentially relevant due to the film connection.
7. Context idx 3 ("127 Hours (soundtrack)") is related to the film's soundtrack and less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
8. Context idx 2 ("Silicon Imaging") is the least relevant as it discusses technical aspects of the camera used in "127 Hours" and does not mention the actors or their nominations.
The remaining contexts do not mention "Flyboys" or "127 Hours" and are therefore not relevant to the claim.

idx: [7, 4, 1, 0, 5, 6, 3, 2]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the actor in "Flyboys" who was also nominated for an Academy Award for "127 Hours". 1.

step-by-step think:1. "James Franco" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions James Franco's nomination for an Academy Award for "127 Hours," directly addressing the claim.

It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "127 Hours" context: While this context is about the film "127 Hours" and mentions James Franco's role, it does not directly link him to "Flyboys," making it slightly less relevant than the previous contexts. However, it is still informative and related to the claim.

It may contain background information useful to the claim. 3. "Trinity Hall Boat Club" context: This context is about a boat club at a college of the University of Cambridge, which is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Wolfson College, Cambridge" context: This context discusses another college of the University of Cambridge, which is less relevant to Ian Harland's education prior to Peterhouse. 5. "UC Berkeley College of Natural Resources" context: This context is about a college in the UC system, which is not relevant to the claim about Ian Harland's education in Cambridge. 6.

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Ian Harland's education prior to attending Peterhouse, Cambridge, including The Dragon School and Haileybury. It is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 9: This context provides information about Peterhouse, Cambridge, which is the college Ian Harland attended. It is relevant because it mentions that Peterhouse is the oldest college at the University of Cambridge, but it does not provide information about his education prior to this. 3. Context idx 0: This context talks about Trinity Hall Boat Club, which is associated with a college at the University of Cambridge. It is less relevant as it does not mention Ian Harland or his education. 4. Context idx 6: This context discusses Wolfson College, Cambridge, which is another college at the University of Cambridge. It is informative but not directly relevant to Ian Harland's education before Peterhouse, Cambridge.
idx: [5, 9, 0, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Ian Harland's education before attending Peterhouse, Cambridge, which is the oldest college at the University of Cambridge. It provides a direct answer to the question, making it the most informative and likely to contain the answer. 2. Context idx 9: This context is about Peterhouse, Cambridge, and while it is relevant because it is the college Ian Harland attended, it does not provide information about his education prior to this, which is what the question asks for. Therefore, it is less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 0 and idx 6: Both contexts are about colleges at the University of Cambridge but do not mention Ian Harland or his educational background. They are informative about their respective subjects but are not likely to contain the answer to the claim. Between the two, idx 0 is slightly more relevant as it pertains to one of the oldest college boat clubs, which could be tangentially related to the historical aspect of the claim.

"Morgan's Ferry" context: This context mentions a film starring Johnny Galecki, but the year is 2001, not 1997, making it less relevant than the first two. 4. "The Law & Harry McGraw" context: This context is about an American mystery crime drama series, which is relevant to the genre but not the specific claim. 5.

idx: [1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 0, 4, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5 "Suicide Kings": This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Suicide Kings" as a 1997 American mystery crime film and confirms Johnny Galecki's involvement in it. 2. Context idx 1 "Johnny Galecki": This context lists the films Johnny Galecki appeared in, including "Suicide Kings" (1997), which directly answers the claim. 3.

Context idx 4 "Penny (The Big Bang Theory)": This context is relevant as it mentions Johnny Galecki's role in "The Big Bang Theory," which could be tangentially related to his film career, but it does not directly answer the claim about the 1997 film.

Question:Which came to market first, "Hey Pa! There's a Goat on the Roof" or "Poleconomy"
golden idx: [1, 5]
step-by-step think: To determine which product came to market first, "Hey Pa! There's a Goat on the Roof" or "Poleconomy," I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 

1. Context idx 5: Directly mentions "Hey Pa! There's a Goat on the Roof" and provides the year it was issued, which is crucial for answering the claim.
2. Context idx 1: Directly mentions "Poleconomy" and provides the year it was first published, which is essential for determining which came first.
3. Context idx 4: Mentions "Rove goat," which could be misleading due to the word "goat" but is not relevant to the board game mentioned in the claim.
4. Context idx 0: Talks about a company that specializes in roof windows, which might seem relevant due to the word "roof" but does not provide information about the board game.
5. Context idx 2: Discusses the Ford flathead V8 engine, which is not relevant to the claim about board games.
6. Context idx 3: Describes a song by Santana, which is not relevant to the claim.
7. Context idx 6: Talks about Vetigel, a veterinary product, which is not relevant to the claim.
8. Context idx 7: Describes Friendship Hall, a historic home, which is not relevant to the claim.
9. Context idx 8: Discusses Pashmina, a type of cashmere wool, which is not relevant to the claim.
10. Context idx 9: Describes Chatta Bazaar, a market in Hyderabad, which is not relevant to the claim.

The contexts that are most relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim are those that mention the products in question and provide a publication or issue year. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim.

idx: [5, 1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: To determine which game came to market first, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the board games "Hey Pa! There's a Goat on the Roof" and "Poleconomy." 1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Hey Pa! There's a Goat on the Roof" and provides the specific year it was issued, 1966. 2. Context idx 1: This context is also highly relevant because it directly mentions "Poleconomy" and provides the specific year it was first published, 1980. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. 3. Context idx 4: This context mentions a breed of goat and could be considered slightly relevant due to the mention of a goat, which is related to the title of one of the board games. However, it does not provide information about the board game itself. 4. Context idx 7: This context is the least relevant of the top four because it does not directly relate to the board games or the claim but is included by default as the fourth context due to the process of elimination.
idx: [5, 1, 4, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Hey Pa! There's a Goat on the Roof" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to one of the board games mentioned in the claim and provides a specific publication year, which is crucial for determining which game came to market first. 2. "Poleconomy" context: This context is also highly relevant because it pertains to the other board game mentioned in the claim and provides its publication year. Comparing the years given in these two contexts will answer the claim. 3. "Rove goat" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a breed of goat and does not provide information about the board game mentioned in the claim. However, it is included because the title might be misleadingly similar to "Hey Pa! There's a Goat on the Roof". 4. "Friendship Hall" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a historic home and its associated family, which has no apparent connection to the board games in question.

golden idx: [0, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking about the army in which the namesake of the ship launched as the München in 1930 fought during the American Revolutionary War. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions the namesake of the München and his involvement in the American Revolutionary War. 
1. Context idx 0: This context mentions the ship being renamed after the famous German officer of the American Revolutionary War, which directly relates to the claim. 
2. Context idx 8: This context provides detailed information about Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, the namesake of the ship, and his role in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. 
3. Context idx 4: This context talks about the Continental Army, which is relevant since Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben served in this army. 
4. Context idx 6: This context is about HMS Vulture, which served during the American Revolutionary War and is known for an event involving the Continental Army. 
5. Context idx 1: This context is about HMS Swan, which served during the American Revolutionary War but does not directly relate to the namesake of the München. 
6. Context idx 3: This context is about Robert Plampin, who served in the American Revolutionary War but is not directly related to the claim. 
7. Context idx 5: This context is about MV Empire Windrush, which was launched as the München but does not provide information about the American Revolutionary War. 
8. Context idx 7: This context is about Tobago, a ship that came into British hands during the French Revolutionary Wars, which is less relevant to the claim. 
9. Context idx 2: This context is about USS Zeilin, which was launched much later than the American Revolutionary War and is not relevant to the claim. 
10. Context idx 9: This context is about USS Proton, which is unrelated to the claim as it pertains to World War II and the Korean War.
idx: [0, 8, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 8: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, the namesake of the ship München, and details his service in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 0: This context is relevant because it connects the ship München with its later name, General von Steuben, and mentions the American Revolutionary War. However, it does not provide specific information about von Steuben's army service. 3. Context idx 4: This context discusses the United States Army and its roots in the Continental Army, which is relevant to the claim since von Steuben served in the Continental Army. 4. Context idx 6: This context is less directly relevant but still mentions the American Revolutionary War and the Continental Army, which von Steuben was a part of.
idx: [8, 0, 4, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who is the namesake of the ship launched as the München. It provides detailed information about his role in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, making it very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "SS General von Steuben" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the ship named after the German officer who served in the American Revolutionary War, which is directly related to the claim. It is less informative regarding the military service of von Steuben compared to the first context but still likely to contain the answer. 3. "United States Army" context: This context is informative about the United States Army and its history, including its roots in the Continental Army, which von Steuben was a part of. It is relevant and may contain the answer to the claim, but it is not as directly related to von Steuben as the first two contexts.

Question:The mass killing that took place at Oakland, California on April 2, 2012 was less deadly than the one that took place on October 1, 2015 in which state?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to identify the contexts that discuss mass killings in specific locations and dates. The claim compares two events: one in Oakland, California on April 2, 2012, and another on October 1, 2015, without specifying the state. Therefore, we need to find contexts that mention these events or similar incidents to determine which was deadlier. 

1. Context idx 4 ("Oikos University shooting") is highly relevant as it directly discusses the mass killing in Oakland, California on April 2, 2012.
2. Context idx 6 ("Umpqua Community College shooting") is also highly relevant as it details the mass shooting on October 1, 2015, in Oregon, which is the comparison point for the claim.
3. Context idx 0 ("April 2007 Mosul massacre") and idx 2 ("Račak massacre") mention mass killings but are not related to the claim's locations or dates.
4. Context idx 1 ("Early-April 1957 tornado outbreak sequence") discusses a tornado outbreak, not a mass killing, and is therefore not relevant.
5. Context idx 3 ("Los Cabos International Film Festival") is irrelevant as it discusses a film festival, not a mass killing.
6. Context idx 5 ("Gymnastics at the 2002 Asian Games") is irrelevant to the claim.
7. Context idx 7 ("Robinson Ekspeditionen 2008") is about a television show and is not relevant.
8. Context idx 8 ("Tezno massacre") discusses a mass killing but not in the relevant location or time frame.
9. Context idx 9 ("1972 American League Championship Series") is about a sports event and is not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the ranking is as follows:
idx: [4, 6, 0, 2, 1, 8, 3, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for a comparison of the deadliness of two mass killings, one in Oakland, California on April 2, 2012, and the other on October 1, 2015, in an unspecified state. To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim and the likelihood that they contain the answer to the question of which state had the more deadly incident in 2015.

1. Context idx 6 ("Umpqua Community College shooting"): This context is highly relevant as it details the mass shooting that occurred on October 1, 2015, which is directly related to the claim. It provides specific information about the number of fatalities and injuries, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim.

2. Context idx 4 ("Oikos University shooting"): This context is also highly relevant because it describes the mass shooting in Oakland, California on April 2, 2012. It provides the number of fatalities, which is necessary for the comparison required by the claim.

3. Context idx 0 ("April 2007 Mosul massacre"): While this context describes a mass killing, it is not relevant to the claim as it occurred in Mosul, Iraq, and not in the United States.

4. Context idx 2 ("Račak massacre"): This context is about a mass killing in Kosovo and, therefore, is not relevant to the claim, which is focused on mass killings in the United States.

5. Context idx 1 ("Early-April 1957 tornado outbreak sequence"): This context is about a tornado outbreak and not a mass killing, making it irrelevant to the claim.

6. Context idx 8 ("Tezno massacre"): This context describes a mass killing in Yugoslavia after World War II and is not relevant to the claim about mass killings in the United States in 2012 and 2015.

7. Context idx 3 ("Los Cabos International Film Festival"): This context is about a film festival and has no relevance to the claim about mass killings.

8. Context idx 5 ("Gymnastics at the 2002 Asian Games"): This context is about gymnastics events and is not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the top four contexts are idx 6, idx 4, idx 0, and idx 2. However, since idx 0 and idx 2 are not relevant to the claim as they do not pertain to mass killings in the United States, they will not be included in the final ranking. Instead, I will include the next most relevant contexts, which are idx 1 and idx 8, despite their lack of direct relevance, as they at least pertain to mass casualties.

idx: [6, 4, 1, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Umpqua Community College shooting" context: This context is highly relevant as it details the shooting that occurred on October 1, 2015, in Oregon, which is directly related to the claim. It provides specific information about the fatalities and the event, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Oikos University shooting" context: This context is also directly relevant as it describes the shooting at Oikos University in Oakland, California, on April 2, 2012. It provides details on the number of fatalities, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Early-April 1957 tornado outbreak sequence" context: Although this context is about a deadly event, it is not directly related to the claim about mass shootings. However, it is informative and provides details on a significant event that occurred on April 2, which is the same date mentioned in the claim. 4. "Tezno massacre" context: This context is about a mass killing, but it is not related to the claim as it occurred in a different time period and location (World War II in Yugoslavia).

"Playground Twist" context: Similar to the previous context, this one is about Siouxsie and the Banshees and is not relevant to the claim about Slade. 6. "The Rats (American band)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different band and does not provide information about Slade's prominence. 7.

It is informative and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "All Join Hands" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the song "All Join Hands" by Slade, but it focuses on the song's release in 1984 rather than the band's rise to prominence. It is somewhat informative but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Crackers: The Christmas Party Album" context: This context is related to the band Slade and mentions the album that includes "All Join Hands." It provides information about the band's activities in the mid-1980s, which is after their rise to prominence. It is informative but less directly relevant to the claim. 4.

step-by-step think:1. Context index 2 "Slade": This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the claim about the rock band Slade's rise to prominence. It provides a detailed account of their success in the 1970s, which is the specific information needed to answer the question. 2.

Question:Where is the company that owns thanKing Horse pub restaurant chain based ?
golden idx: [1, 3]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim is about the location of the company that owns the thanKing Horse pub restaurant chain. 

1. Context idx 3 ("Greene King"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Greene King, which is a pub retailer and brewer based in the UK. Since the claim is about a pub restaurant chain, this context is likely to contain the answer.

2. Context idx 1 ("Hungry Horse"): This context is directly related to the claim as it mentions Hungry Horse, a pub-restaurant chain owned by Greene King Brewery. It provides the location as England, Wales, and Scotland, which is informative and likely contains the answer.

3. Context idx 6 ("The Chessels"): This context mentions an area known for a pub, which could be related to the claim. However, it does not directly mention the thanKing Horse chain, so it's less relevant than idx 3 and 1.

4. Context idx 0 ("The Works (restaurant)"): This context is about a Canadian restaurant chain. It's not directly related to the claim but is included because it's about a restaurant chain's headquarters.

5. Context idx 4 ("Fazoli's"): This context talks about an Italian-American restaurant chain. It's informative but not directly relevant to the claim about a pub restaurant chain.

6. Context idx 5 ("Klenger Burger"): This context is about an Indonesian restaurant chain. It's less relevant because it's about a different type of cuisine and location.

7. Context idx 7 ("Chefette"): This context is about a restaurant chain based in Barbados. It's less likely to contain the answer because the location is not related to the claim.

8. Context idx 9 ("Todai (restaurant)"): This context is about a restaurant chain with international locations. It's the least relevant because it does not provide information about the ownership or location of the thanKing Horse chain.

Contexts idx 2 ("Piccadilly Pub") and idx 8 ("VIP's") are not included in the top 8 because they are less relevant than the others mentioned above.

idx: [3, 1, 6, 0, 4, 5, 7, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine the ranking of the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood that it contains the answer. 1. "Greene King" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Greene King, which is a pub retailer and brewer in the UK and owns pubs, restaurants, and hotels. It is likely to contain the answer since it specifies the location of Greene King's base. 2. "Hungry Horse" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions that Hungry Horse is owned by Greene King Brewery and provides information about the chain's establishment and offerings. 3. "The Works (restaurant)" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions a Canadian restaurant chain, which is not related to the claim about the thanKing Horse pub restaurant chain. 4. "Fazoli's" context: This context is informative but not directly relevant to the claim as it discusses an Italian-American restaurant chain based in Kentucky. 5. "Klenger Burger" context: This context is about an Indonesian restaurant chain and is not relevant to the claim. 6. "Chefette" context: This context is about a restaurant chain based in Barbados and is not relevant to the claim. 7. "Todai (restaurant)" context: This context is about a restaurant chain based in the United States and is not relevant to the claim. 8. "The Chessels" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses an area in Bristol and a former pub, which has no direct connection to the claim.
idx: [3,1,0,4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Greene King" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Greene King, which is the UK's largest pub retailer and brewer, and states that it is based in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England. Since Greene King owns pubs, restaurants, and hotels, it is very likely that it contains the answer to the claim about the location of the company that owns the thanKing Horse pub restaurant chain. 2. "Hungry Horse" context: This context is also relevant because it specifies that Hungry Horse, a chain of pub-restaurants, is owned by Greene King Brewery. It provides a direct connection to Greene King, supporting the relevance to the claim. 3. "The Works (restaurant)" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a Canadian restaurant chain, which is not related to the thanKing Horse pub restaurant chain or Greene King. 4. "Fazoli's" context: This context is the least relevant because it talks about an Italian-American restaurant chain based in Kentucky, which has no apparent connection to the thanKing Horse pub restaurant chain or Greene King.

Question:What is the uppermost age range for the sort of fiction written by Alexander Gordon Smith?
golden idx: [0, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim regarding Alexander Gordon Smith's fiction age range, I will analyze each context. 1. "Alexander Gordon Smith" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the author and specifies that he writes children and Young Adult fiction. 2. "Escape from Furnace" context: This context is relevant because it discusses a series written by Alexander Gordon Smith and provides insight into the themes and age of the protagonist, which aligns with the uppermost age range for YA fiction. 3. "The Inventors" context: This context is relevant as it describes another work by Alexander Gordon Smith, indicating the target audience age through the characters and plot. 4. "Young adult fiction" context: This context is informative about the YA genre, which is the category of Smith's work, and discusses the age range for YA fiction, which is likely to overlap with the age range for Smith's fiction. 5. "Junior school" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses the age range for primary education, which is below the target audience of Smith's fiction. 6. "Sugardaddyforme.com" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses an online dating site and its demographic, which is unrelated to Smith's fiction. 7. "George Gordon (bishop)" context: This context is not relevant as it discusses historical figures unrelated to the author or his work. 8. "Grant Smith (footballer)" context: This context is not relevant as it is about a footballer who shares a similar name but is unrelated to the author or his work. 9. "James Ogilvie" context: This context is not relevant as it discusses a historical prelate and is unrelated to the author or his work. 10. "Irish prose fiction" context: This context is not relevant as it discusses the history of Irish fiction in general and does not pertain to Smith's work.
idx: [7,4,6,0,2,1,5,3]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 0: "Young adult fiction" - This context is highly relevant as it defines the age range for young adult fiction, which is the category of literature Alexander Gordon Smith writes for. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: "Alexander Gordon Smith" - This context mentions that Smith is an author of children and Young Adult fiction, directly linking him to the YA category, making it relevant and likely to contain the answer. 3. Context idx 4: "Escape from Furnace" - This context is about a series written by Smith and provides insight into the themes and age of the protagonist, which can give clues about the target age range. 4. Context idx 6: "The Inventors" - This context talks about another series by Smith, indicating the type of audience the books are intended for, which is relevant to the claim.
idx: [0, 7, 4, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Alexander Gordon Smith" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Alexander Gordon Smith and identifies him as an author of children and Young Adult fiction, which is the category in question for the age range. 2. "Young adult fiction" context: This context is relevant because it defines the age range for young adult fiction, which is the genre that Alexander Gordon Smith writes for. It provides a subjective range of ages 12–18 and mentions that some define it as written for those aged 15 to the early 20s. 3. "Escape from Furnace" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it describes a series written by Alexander Gordon Smith and gives insight into the themes and age of the protagonist, which may reflect the intended audience age range. However, it does not explicitly mention the age range. 4. "The Inventors" context: This context is informative about another work by Alexander Gordon Smith but is less relevant to the specific claim about the uppermost age range for his fiction, as it does not discuss the age range at all.

Context idx 3: This context is about the album for the film adaptation of "The Revenger's Tragedy", which is related but does not mention the actress or her birthday. 5. Context idx 2: This context is about a song for the movie "Revengers Tragedy", which is related but does not mention the actress or her birthday. 6. Context idx 6: This context references "The Revenger's Tragedy" in the title of a play, which shows some relevance but is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 7.

"Diana Quick" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Diana Quick and provides her birthdate, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Revengers Tragedy" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Diana Quick as the actress who played the Duchess, linking her to the claim. 3. "Emily Jewell" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions Emily Jewell as an actress who appeared in "The Duchess", which could be confused with "The Revengers Tragedy". 4. "Revengers Tragedy (album)" context: This context is relevant to the film but does not mention the cast or the Duchess, making it less likely to contain the answer. 5. "Revengers Tragedy (song)" context: Similar to the album, this context is related to the film's soundtrack and does not provide information about the cast. 6. "The Revengers' Comedies" context: This context references "The Revenger's Tragedy" but is about a different play, making it less relevant. 7. "Appius and Virginia" context: This context is about a different play by John Webster and does not relate to the claim. 8. "The Duchess of Padua" context: This context is about a different play and does not mention "The Revengers Tragedy" or the actress in question.

"Revengers Tragedy" context: This context is relevant as it confirms Diana Quick's role as the Duchess in the film, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not provide her birthday. 3. "Emily Jewell" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions an actress who played the Duchess in a different production and does not provide information about "The Revengers Tragedy" or Diana Quick. 4. "Revengers Tragedy (album)" context: This context is the least relevant as it is about the soundtrack album for the film and does not mention the cast or their birthdays.

Question:Which film starring Patrick Tatten is based on a book written by Steve Lopez?
golden idx: [3, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider their relevance to the claim about a film starring Patrick Tatten based on a book by Steve Lopez. 1. Context 3: "The Soloist" is the most relevant as it mentions both the film and the book by Steve Lopez. 2. Context 9: "Patrick Tatten" is highly relevant because it lists the films he's known for, including "The Soloist." 3. Context 8: "Third and Indiana" is a book by Steve Lopez, which could be a potential source for a film. 4. Context 5: "Njan Steve Lopez" is a film that could be confused with the claim but is less likely since the book author doesn't match. 5. Context 6: "Farhaan Faasil" is related to "Njan Steve Lopez," which has a slight connection to the claim. 6. Context 4: "Alencier Ley Lopez" is less relevant as it mentions different films and a different Lopez. 7. Context 0: "True Love (book)" is not relevant to Patrick Tatten or Steve Lopez's "The Soloist." 8. Context 7: "The Three Lives of Thomasina" is the least relevant as it doesn't connect to the claim.

Context idx 5: This context mentions a film titled "Njan Steve Lopez," which could be misleading due to the name similarity, but it does not relate to the claim as it is not based on a book by Steve Lopez nor does it star Patrick Tatten.
idx: [3, 9, 8, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "The Soloist" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both "The Soloist" film and the book by Steve Lopez, which is directly related to the claim. It also states that Patrick Tatten starred in the film, making it very likely to contain the answer. 2. "Patrick Tatten" context: This context is relevant because it confirms Patrick Tatten's involvement in "The Soloist," which is the film in question. However, it does not mention the book by Steve Lopez, making it slightly less relevant than the first context. 3. "Third and Indiana" context: This context is relevant to the extent that it mentions a book written by Steve Lopez, but it does not relate to the film starring Patrick Tatten or the claim's focus on a film based on a book by Steve Lopez. 4. "Njan Steve Lopez" context: This context is the least relevant as it mentions a different film with a similar name but does not connect to Patrick Tatten or the book by Steve Lopez.

"Wonder en is gheen Wonder" context: This context is less directly related but mentions Skeptical Inquirer as a reference, which might offer comparative insights. 8. "Susan Gerbic" context: This context is the least directly related to the claim but mentions Skeptical Inquirer and could provide additional, albeit indirect, information.
idx: [0,7,1,3,4,2,5,8]

step-by-step think: To address the claim about whether Skeptical Inquirer and The Progressive Populist are both tabloid-style magazines, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 1. "The Progressive Populist" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly describes The Progressive Populist as a magazine in tabloid newspaper format, which is a key part of the claim. 2. "Skeptical Inquirer" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides detailed information about the Skeptical Inquirer, including its subtitle and publishing history, which helps determine its style. 3. "CSICon" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, which publishes the Skeptical Inquirer, but it does not directly address the magazine's format. 4. "James Alcock" context: This context is relevant as it mentions James Alcock's association with the Skeptical Inquirer, which could provide insight into the magazine's style through his contributions. The remaining contexts are less directly related to the claim as they do not provide specific information about the magazines' formats or styles.
idx: [7, 0, 2, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "The Progressive Populist" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that The Progressive Populist is indeed a magazine in tabloid format, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Skeptical Inquirer" context: This context is relevant because it describes the Skeptical Inquirer magazine and its publisher, which is necessary to determine if it fits the tabloid-style category. However, it does not explicitly state the magazine's format, making it slightly less relevant than the first context. 3. "CSICon" context: This context is related to the Skeptical Inquirer magazine as it is published by the same committee that hosts CSICon. It is indirectly relevant to the claim but less so than the direct mentions of the magazines themselves. 4. "James Alcock" context: While this context mentions the Skeptical Inquirer, it focuses more on James Alcock's contributions and honors rather than the magazine's format, making it the least relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [2, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the 1984 film "Marlene," which is a documentary about an actress. The most relevant context would be the one that directly relates to Marlene Dietrich, the subject of the documentary. 1. "Marlene (1984 film)" context: This context is directly about the film in question and mentions Marlene Dietrich, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Marlene Dietrich" context: This context provides detailed information about Marlene Dietrich, including her birth year, which is the answer to the claim. 3. "Madhuri Dixit filmography" context: This context mentions a debut in a 1984 film, which could potentially confuse the answer but is less relevant than the contexts directly related to Marlene Dietrich. 4. "Lisa Wilcox" context: This context also mentions a film debut in 1984, which is tangentially related to the claim but not about Marlene Dietrich. 5. "Daniela Castillo" context: This context mentions a birth year of 1984, which is relevant to the claim's date but not about the actress in question. 6. "Julie Ordon" context: Similar to the previous, this context mentions a birth year of 1984 but is about a different actress. 7. "Evelina Simonaho" context: Again, this context mentions a birth year of 1984 but is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 8. "Sara Botsford" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention the film or the birth year in question but is included due to the limit of eight contexts.
idx: [2, 9, 4, 7, 3, 1, 0, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Marlene Dietrich" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Marlene Dietrich and provides specific information about her birth date, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Marlene (1984 film)" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the documentary film "Marlene," which is the subject of the claim. However, it does not provide the birth year of Marlene Dietrich, which is the specific answer sought. 3. "Lisa Wilcox" context: This context mentions an actress and a film from 1984, which may seem relevant at first glance, but it does not pertain to Marlene Dietrich or the documentary "Marlene." 4. "Madhuri Dixit filmography" context: This context is about another actress and her filmography starting in 1984, which is not relevant to the claim about Marlene Dietrich.
idx: [9,2,7,4]

step-by-step think:1. "Marlene Dietrich" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Marlene Dietrich directly and provides specific information about her birth year, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Marlene (1984 film)" context: This context is about the documentary film itself and mentions Marlene Dietrich, making it relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Madhuri Dixit filmography" context: Although this context mentions a film from 1984, it is about a different actress and is therefore less relevant to the claim about Marlene Dietrich. 4. "Lisa Wilcox" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a different actress who made her film debut in 1984 but is not related to the documentary "Marlene" or Marlene Dietrich.

Context idx 3 (Wilton, Maine): Another former mill town, but in Maine, USA, which is less relevant due to the distance. 7. Context idx 6 (Savage, Maryland): Mentions Savage as a former mill town and a historic place, but its relevance is lower due to its location in Maryland, USA. 8. Context idx 5 (Stank Hall): While it mentions a historic building and a barn, it does not indicate a former mill town or proximity to Rivington Hall Barn, making it the least relevant.
idx: [7, 8, 9, 0, 4, 3, 6, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts for the claim, I will consider the proximity to Rivington Hall Barn and the mention of being a former mill town. 1.

"Breed standard (dogs)" context: This context discusses breed standards in general, which might be informative but is less directly relevant to the claim. 6. "Dog Tales (1958 film)" context: This context mentions a Basset Hound but in an animated film context, making it less relevant. 7. "Barnyard Dawg" context: This context is about a fictional Basset Hound character, making it the least relevant to the claim. 8. "Fred Basset" context: Similar to the "Barnyard Dawg" context, this is about a comic strip character and is not directly relevant to the claim. The remaining contexts ("List of U.S. state dogs" and "Bulldog") do not mention either breed in the context of being a giant dog breed and are therefore not included in the top 8.
idx: [2, 4, 7, 9, 3, 1, 0, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts for the claim, I will consider the direct mention of the dog breeds in question and the information provided about their size category. 1. "Leonberger" context: This context is highly relevant as it explicitly states that the Leonberger is a giant dog breed, directly answering the claim. 2. "Giant dog breed" context: This context provides general information about what constitutes a giant dog breed, which is relevant to understanding the classification of the Leonberger and Basset Hound. 3.

Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it provides the specific release year of "Making Today a Perfect Day," which is 2015. 2. Context idx 6: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions "Frozen Fever" as a sequel to "Frozen," indicating that "Frozen" was produced earlier.

Question:Which magazine is published more often, Shonen Jump or Rolling Stone?
golden idx: [7, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine which magazine is published more often, we need to look for contexts that provide information about the publication frequency of "Shonen Jump" and "Rolling Stone". Contexts that mention "Weekly Shonen Jump" suggest a weekly publication frequency, while the context mentioning "Rolling Stone" indicates a biweekly publication. Therefore, contexts that include details about the publication frequency of "Shonen Jump" are most relevant. 1. Context idx 4: This context talks about "Weekly Shonen Jump" and its transition from print to digital, indicating a weekly publication. 2. Context idx 8: This context mentions "Shonen Jump" and its publication history, which is relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 7: This context provides information on "Rolling Stone", including its biweekly publication frequency. 4. Context idx 0: Mentions "Weekly Shonen Jump" but focuses on a specific manga artist. 5. Context idx 1: Talks about "Weekly Shonen Jump" and its serialization of a particular series. 6. Context idx 2: Mentions "Weekly Shonen Jump" and its serialization dates for "Cross Manage". 7. Context idx 3: Provides information on "Black Clover" serialized in "Weekly Shonen Jump". 8. Context idx 6: Discusses "Nisekoi" serialized in "Weekly Shonen Jump". The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not provide direct information about the publication frequency or are about "Monthly Shonen Jump", which is different from the claim.
idx: [4,8,7,0,1,2,3,6]

step-by-step think: To determine which magazine is published more often, we need to compare the publication frequencies of "Shonen Jump" and "Rolling Stone". 1. Context idx 4: This context provides detailed information about "Weekly Shonen Jump" as a digital manga anthology and its publication history, which is highly relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context talks about "Shonen Jump" being retooled from a weekly to a monthly publication, which directly addresses the claim's concern about publication frequency. 3. Context idx 7: This context describes "Rolling Stone" as a biweekly magazine, which is essential for comparing publication frequencies. 4. Context idx 1: Although this context is about "Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo" chapters in "Weekly Shonen Jump", it is less directly related to the claim than the contexts that discuss the magazines' publication frequencies. The other contexts are about specific manga series or artists and do not provide direct information about the publication frequency of "Shonen Jump" or "Rolling Stone".
idx: [4, 8, 7, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Weekly Shonen Jump (American magazine)" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides detailed information about the publication frequency of "Weekly Shonen Jump", which is a key part of the claim. It mentions that it started as a weekly digital publication, which is directly related to the claim about publishing frequency. 2. "Rolling Stone" context: This context is relevant because it describes "Rolling Stone" as a biweekly magazine, which directly addresses the claim's question about publication frequency. 3. "Shonen Jump (magazine)" context: This context is also relevant as it talks about "Shonen Jump" being retooled from a weekly to a monthly publication, which provides a contrast to the "Weekly Shonen Jump" and is necessary to answer the claim. The context about "List of Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo chapters" is less relevant because it does not discuss the publication frequency of the magazine itself.

"Am Rong" context: This context directly provides the birth year of Am Rong as 1929, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. "Ava DuVernay" context: This context provides the birth date of Ava DuVernay as August 24, 1972, which is essential for comparing the birth dates. 3.

However, it is related to Ava DuVernay through her film work. 4. "Spencer Averick" context: This context mentions Ava DuVernay but does not provide her birth date. It is relevant due to the association with DuVernay. 5. "Howard Barish" context: Similar to the previous context, it mentions Ava DuVernay but does not provide her birth date. It is relevant due to the association with DuVernay. 6. "Takeshi Fukunaga" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Ava DuVernay's distribution company, but it does not provide information on her birth date. 7.

Question:Are both Duke Energy and Affiliated Managers Group based in Massachusetts?
golden idx: [7, 8]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to find contexts that mention the headquarters or base locations of Duke Energy and Affiliated Managers Group. 1. "Affiliated Managers Group" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly states that Affiliated Managers Group is headquartered in Massachusetts, which is part of the claim. 2. "Duke Energy" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions that Duke Energy is headquartered in North Carolina, not Massachusetts. 3. "Darrell Crate" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Darrell Crate's association with Affiliated Managers Group and his current firm in Massachusetts, which could imply the location of AMG. 4. "Sean Healey" context: This context mentions Sean Healey as the chairman and CEO of Affiliated Managers Group, which could be informative regarding the company's base. 5. "Crescent Communities" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it traces the history of Duke Energy's land management and development, which could indirectly inform about its base. 6. "Duke Energy Florida" context: This context is relevant to Duke Energy's operations in Florida but less likely to contain the answer about the headquarters. 7.

step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to identify the contexts that provide information about the headquarters of Duke Energy and Affiliated Managers Group. 1. "Affiliated Managers Group" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Affiliated Managers Group is headquartered in Massachusetts. It directly answers part of the claim. 2.

golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is about two positions filled in "The Voice of Ireland" by members of a British-Irish girl group based in London, England. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions "The Voice of Ireland" and the involvement of the girl group. 1. "The Voice of Ireland (series 4)" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions "The Voice of Ireland" and states that Una Healy from The Saturdays and Rachel Stevens from S Club 7 filled the remaining two positions. It is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "The Saturdays" context: This context provides information about the girl group The Saturdays, including its members and formation. It is relevant and likely to contain background information that supports the answer. 3. "Una Healy" context: Although not provided in the given contexts, any context mentioning Una Healy would be relevant as she is a member of The Saturdays who filled one of the positions in "The Voice of Ireland". 4. "Headlines!" context: This context talks about The Saturdays' debut EP and includes information about their music, which is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 5. "Notorious (The Saturdays song)" context: This context discusses a specific song by The Saturdays and provides details about their music style, which is less directly relevant to the claim. 6. "Forever Is Over" context: This context is about a single by The Saturdays and is informative about their work but not directly related to the claim. 7. "Higher (The Saturdays song)" context: This context discusses another song by The Saturdays and their interaction with Flo Rida, which is less relevant to the claim. 8. "On Your Radar" context: This context provides information about The Saturdays' third studio album, which is informative but not directly related to the claim about "The Voice of Ireland". The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim as they do not mention "The Voice of Ireland" or the involvement of The Saturdays in the show.

This context is informative and directly answers the claim. 2. Context 6 ("The Saturdays") provides background information about the girl group The Saturdays, which is relevant to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer since it confirms the group is based in London, England. 3. Context 4 ("Notorious (The Saturdays song)") is less relevant than the first two contexts as it focuses on a specific song by The Saturdays. However, it still pertains to the group in question and thus is somewhat likely to contain the answer. Context 3 ("Headlines!") is about The Saturdays' EP and does not mention The Voice of Ireland or the members' involvement in it, making it the least relevant to the claim.

Question:What studio album did Kanye West record with Roc-A-Fella Records and soul singer Dwele?
golden idx: [5, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about Kanye West's studio album recorded with Roc-A-Fella Records and soul singer Dwele. The most relevant contexts will mention both the album and Dwele's contribution. 

1. Context idx 4 ("Graduation (album)"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Graduation" as Kanye West's third studio album with Roc-A-Fella Records and specifically notes Dwele's contribution, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 2 ("Flashing Lights (Kanye West song)"): This context is relevant because it mentions the song "Flashing Lights" from the "Graduation" album, which features Dwele. It is likely to contain the answer as it directly relates to the collaboration with Dwele.
3. Context idx 7 ("Power (Kanye West song)"): This context is relevant as it mentions the song "Power" from the "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" album, which includes vocals by Dwele. It is less directly related to the claim than the "Graduation" album but still likely to contain the answer.
4. Context idx 6 ("The People (Common song)"): This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions a song produced by Kanye West that features Dwele. However, it does not mention a studio album by Kanye West, so it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
5. Context idx 0 ("Hip Hop Since 1978"): This context is informative about Kanye West's relationship with Roc-A-Fella Records and his first album, but it does not mention Dwele or the specific album in question, making it less likely to contain the answer.
6. Context idx 1 ("Late Registration"): This context mentions Kanye West's second studio album with Roc-A-Fella Records but does not mention Dwele, making it less relevant to the claim.
7. Context idx 5 ("My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"): This context mentions Kanye West's fifth studio album with Roc-A-Fella Records but does not mention Dwele or his contribution, making it less relevant to the claim.
8. Context idx 9 ("The College Dropout"): This context is about Kanye West's debut studio album with Roc-A-Fella Records but does not mention Dwele, making it less relevant to the claim.

The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim as they do not mention both Kanye West's studio albums with Roc-A-Fella Records and Dwele's contributions.

Sims" case in question but could still be considered for background information. 5. "Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different "Reynolds" case, but it is related to the "Reynolds" name and could provide some background. 6. "Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe Sprl" context: This context is related to "Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd" and might offer some insight into the legal principles that could be relevant to understanding the "Reynolds" cases. 7.

Comparing the years given in both contexts, it is clear which case was decided first. 3. "Charles Morgan Jr." context: This context mentions the "Reynolds v. Sims" case and the attorney involved, which adds some relevance but is not as directly related to the claim as the contexts that provide the years of the decisions. 4. "Reynolds v. United States" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a different case with a similar name but from a different year (1878) and does not help in determining which of the two cases in the claim was decided first.

8. Context idx 4: This context is about Kamran Rasheed, a Pakistani American cricketer, which is the least relevant to the claim but still mentions Pakistani cricket.

The remaining contexts (idx 2 and 6) are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the Akmal brothers or their representation of a country in cricket.

Question:Both Sorbaria and Goldenrod are a genus of more than 50 flowering plants?
golden idx: [2, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the genus of both Sorbaria and Goldenrod, specifically whether they consist of more than 50 flowering plants. To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer.

1. Context idx 6: This context is directly relevant as it mentions that Goldenrod (Solidago) is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim regarding the number of species in the Goldenrod genus.
2. Context idx 2: This context mentions Sorbaria as a genus of around 9 species of flowering plants. It is directly relevant to the claim and likely contains the answer regarding the number of species in the Sorbaria genus.
3. Context idx 0: This context talks about a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, which is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim about the number of species in the genus.
4. Context idx 1: Similar to idx 0, this context discusses a specific species within the Goldenrod genus and is somewhat relevant.
5. Context idx 3: This context also discusses a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, similar to idx 0 and 1.
6. Context idx 5: Again, this context is about a specific species within the Goldenrod genus.
7. Context idx 7: This context is about a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, like the others mentioned above.
8. Context idx 8: This context is about a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, similar to the other contexts mentioned.

The remaining contexts (idx 4 and 9) are less relevant because they either discuss a monotypic genus or a specific species within the Goldenrod genus that does not contribute to the claim about the number of species in the genus.

idx: [6, 2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Goldenrod" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Goldenrod (Solidago) is a genus with about 100 to 120 species, which directly addresses the claim regarding the number of species in the genus. 2. "Sorbaria" context: This context is also relevant because it provides the exact number of species in the Sorbaria genus, which is necessary to verify the claim. 3. "Solidago elongata" context: While this context provides information on a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, it is less directly relevant to the claim about the number of species in the genus. 4. "Solidago rugosa" context: This context gives details on the distribution of a specific Goldenrod species, which might indirectly help confirm the claim by showing the genus's diversity but is not directly about the number of species. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they focus on specific species or regions rather than the genus as a whole.
idx: [6, 2, 0, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Goldenrod" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides specific information about the genus Solidago, commonly known as goldenrods, and states that it consists of about 100 to 120 species. This directly addresses the claim regarding the number of species in the genus Goldenrod. 2. "Sorbaria" context: This context is also relevant because it gives precise information about the genus Sorbaria, stating that it comprises around 9 species. This helps to verify the claim about the number of species in the genus Sorbaria. 3. "Solidago elongata" context: While this context provides detailed information about a specific species within the genus Solidago, it is less directly relevant to the claim about the number of species in the genus as a whole. However, it is still informative and related to the topic. 4. "Solidago rugosa" context: Similar to the "Solidago elongata" context, this one provides information about a specific species within the genus Solidago. It is informative but less directly relevant to the overall claim about the number of species in the genus.

golden idx: [7, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for a comparison of the dates of two battles, the Battle of Peleliu and the Battle of Belleau Wood. Therefore, the contexts that directly mention the dates of these battles are most relevant. 1. "Battle of Belleau Wood" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the specific dates of the Battle of Belleau Wood, which is one of the battles in question. 2. "Battle of Peleliu" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions the specific dates of the Battle of Peleliu, the other battle in question. 3. "Clifton B. Cates" context: This context mentions Clifton B. Cates' involvement in the Battle of Belleau Wood, making it somewhat relevant, but it does not provide the specific date of the battle. 4.

"Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial" context: This context is relevant because it is related to the location of the Battle of Belleau Wood, but it does not provide the date of the battle. 6. "Elmo M. Haney" context: This context mentions Haney's participation in the Battle of Belleau Wood, adding some relevance. 7. "USS Belleau Wood" context: This context is less relevant as it only mentions the naming of a ship after the Battle of Belleau Wood. 8.

Question:What was the name of the 19th century foundry which was located in a village directly across the Hudson River from Westpoint in Putnam County, New York?
golden idx: [2, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about the 19th-century foundry in Putnam County, New York. 1. "Robert Parker Parrott" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Robert Parker Parrott, who became the superintendent of the West Point Iron and Cannon Foundry in Cold Spring, New York, which is likely the foundry in question. It provides detailed information about his association with the foundry and is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2.

However, it does not directly mention the foundry, making it slightly less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. "Hudson Highlands State Park" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it describes the location of the park in Putnam County and its proximity to Cold Spring, but it does not mention the foundry directly. 5. "Hudson River Valley Greenway" context: This context is relevant due to its mention of Putnam County and its location along the Hudson River, but like the previous context, it does not directly mention the foundry. 6. "Bull Hill" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on the history of a mountain in Putnam County and does not mention the foundry. 7. "Jones Point, New York" context: This context is less relevant because it focuses on a hamlet in Rockland County, which is not directly related to the claim about the foundry in Putnam County. 8. "Breakneck Brook" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a brook in Putnam County without any direct connection to the foundry. 9. "Cortland Condit House" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a historic house in Illinois, not New York. 10. "New York State Route 121" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it focuses on a state highway and does not mention the foundry.

Question:What fictional character created by Tom Clancy was turned into a film in 2002?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for a fictional character created by Tom Clancy that was turned into a film in 2002. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions a character from a Tom Clancy creation that was adapted into a film during that year. 

1. 'The Sum of All Fears' context: This is the most relevant context as it directly mentions that the novel was part of the Jack Ryan universe and was turned into a film in 2002. 
2. 'Jack Ryan (character)' context: This context is highly relevant because it mentions Jack Ryan, a character created by Tom Clancy who appears in his novels and their respective film adaptations.
3. 'Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)' context: This context is relevant as it talks about Sam Fisher, a character from a series endorsed by Tom Clancy, but it does not mention a film adaptation in 2002.
4. 'Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow' context: This context is informative about the Splinter Cell series and the character Sam Fisher, but it discusses a video game, not a film.
5. 'Tom Clancy's Net Force Explorers: Cold Case' context: This context is less relevant as it talks about a young adult novel series but does not mention any film adaptation.
6. 'Tom Clancy's Net Force Explorers: Gameprey' context: Similar to the previous context, this one also talks about the Net Force Explorers series without mentioning a film.

Since there are only six contexts provided and the task requires ranking the top eight, the last two spots will remain empty.

Question:Wheat salad is composed typically of what red fruit?
golden idx: [1, 3]
step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts for the claim that "Wheat salad is composed typically of what red fruit?", I will evaluate each context based on its relevance to wheat salad and the likelihood of containing information about a red fruit typically included in it. 1. "Wheat salad" context: This context directly addresses wheat salad and mentions tomatoes, which are a red fruit, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 2. "Tomato" context: Since tomatoes are a common red fruit used in salads, this context is very relevant and likely to contain the answer. 3. "Salad bar" context: This context is relevant as it mentions salad components, including red bell peppers and tomatoes, which could be the red fruit in question. 4. "Fruit salad" context: While this context is about fruit salads, it may contain useful information about common fruits used in salads, including red fruits. 5. "Candle salad" context: This context is less directly relevant as it describes a specific type of fruit salad, but it does mention cherries, which are red fruits. 6. "Bean salad" context: This context is less relevant but mentions a variety of salads, which could potentially include information about red fruits. 7. "Jello salad" context: This context is not directly related to wheat salad but mentions fruit ingredients in gelatin salads, which might include red fruits. 8. "Crataegus pinnatifida" context: Although this context is about a specific red fruit, it is less likely to be relevant to wheat salad. The remaining contexts ("Wheat allergy," "Pandanus conoideus") are not directly relevant to the claim about wheat salad composition and red fruits.
idx: [3, 1, 0, 7, 2, 9, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for a red fruit that is typically part of a wheat salad. 1. "Wheat salad" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions wheat salad and lists its typical ingredients, including the red fruit in question, tomatoes. 2. "Tomato" context: This context is highly relevant because it provides detailed information about tomatoes, which are the red fruit typically found in wheat salad. 3. "Salad bar" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions salad components, including tomatoes, which could be part of a wheat salad. 4. "Fruit salad" context: This context is less relevant because it discusses fruit salad in general, which is different from wheat salad, but it still mentions fruit, which could include the red fruit in question. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not directly address wheat salad or the specific red fruit typically included in it.
idx: [3, 1, 0, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Wheat salad" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly describes the composition of wheat salad, mentioning tomatoes, which are typically red, as an ingredient. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Tomato" context: This context is about the tomato, which is identified as a red fruit in the claim. It provides detailed information about tomatoes, making it relevant and likely to contain the answer. 3. "Salad bar" context: While this context mentions tomatoes as part of a salad bar, it is less directly related to wheat salad specifically. However, it still contains relevant information that could answer the claim. 4. "Fruit salad" context: This context is about fruit salad, which is different from wheat salad. It is less relevant to the claim and less likely to contain the specific answer about wheat salad's typical red fruit component.

Question:What year did the biographical-comedy-crime film directed by Steven Soderbergh about the highest-level corporate executive whistleblower come out?
golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the release year of a biographical-comedy-crime film directed by Steven Soderbergh about a corporate executive whistleblower. Context 6 titled 'The Informant!' directly addresses the claim as it is the only context that mentions a biographical-comedy-crime film directed by Soderbergh about a whistleblower, which is Mark Whitacre, and states the release year as 2009. This context is the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. Context 0 also mentions Mark Whitacre and his role as a whistleblower, which is relevant to the claim but does not mention the film; however, it provides background information that could be useful. Contexts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 mention other works by Steven Soderbergh but do not relate to the claim about the whistleblower film. Among these, contexts that mention films closer to the year in question or have a similar genre (biographical or crime) may be slightly more relevant. Therefore, 'Out of Sight' (context 9) and 'Gray's Anatomy (film)' (context 7) are ranked next as they are films and are closer in genre or period. The remaining contexts are ranked based on their relevance to filmmaking and the likelihood of containing information related to the claim.
idx: [6, 0, 9, 7, 1, 2, 3, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "The Informant!" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the film "The Informant!" and provides the release year, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Mark Whitacre" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the real person, Mark Whitacre, who is the subject of the film "The Informant!" It provides background information that is related to the claim. 3. "Logan Lucky" context: This context mentions Steven Soderbergh as the director and provides details about another film he directed. It is less relevant than the first two but still provides useful information about Soderbergh's work. 4. "Contagion (film)" context: This context also mentions a film directed by Steven Soderbergh and is informative about his style, but it is less directly related to the claim than the contexts ranked higher.
idx: [6, 0, 1, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. "The Informant!" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the title of the film, the director Steven Soderbergh, and provides the exact year of release, 2009, which answers the claim. 2. "Mark Whitacre" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the real person, Mark Whitacre, who is the subject of the film "The Informant!" and his role as a whistleblower, which is central to the film's plot. However, it does not provide the release year of the film. 3. "Contagion (film)" context: While this context is about another film directed by Steven Soderbergh, it is not relevant to the claim about the biographical-comedy-crime film regarding a whistleblower. It does not contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Logan Lucky" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a different film by Steven Soderbergh that is unrelated to the claim about the whistleblower film.

Question:Are Phlebodium and Pieris both species of ferns?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to identify contexts that discuss whether Phlebodium and Pieris are species of ferns. Context 6 directly mentions "Phlebodium" as a genus of ferns, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 5 also discusses "Phlebodium aureum," a specific species within the genus, providing additional relevant information. Context 2 talks about leptosporangiate ferns, which is a broader category that could include Phlebodium, thus it's somewhat relevant. Context 8 mentions tree ferns, which is related to the topic of ferns but does not specifically address Phlebodium or Pieris. Context 4 mentions "Pieris" as a plant genus, but it refers to shrubs, not ferns, which is informative but may confuse the query. Context 9 discusses "Pieris floribunda," a shrub, again informative but not a fern. Contexts 0, 1, 3, and 7 discuss "Pieris" in the context of butterflies, which is not relevant to the claim about ferns.

step-by-step think:1. "Phlebodium" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Phlebodium is a genus of ferns, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Pieris (plant)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it clarifies that Pieris is a genus of shrubs, not ferns, thus providing the answer to the other half of the claim. 3. "Phlebodium aureum" context: While this context is about a specific species within the Phlebodium genus and provides detailed information, it is less directly relevant to the claim than the general information about the genus. 4. "Tree fern" context: This context discusses tree ferns broadly and mentions various genera, but does not directly address the claim about Phlebodium and Pieris. It is informative but less relevant. 5. "Leptosporangiate fern" context: This context provides information on a large group of ferns, which might include Phlebodium, but it does not specifically confirm the claim. 6. "Pieris floribunda" context: This context gives details about a specific species within the Pieris genus, which is relevant but less so than the context about the genus as a whole. 7. "Sinopieris" context: This context is about a genus of butterflies that was once included in Pieris, which is not relevant to the claim about ferns. 8. "Pieris canidia" context: This context is about a butterfly species in the family Pieridae and is not relevant to the claim about ferns.
idx: [6, 4, 5, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Phlebodium" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Phlebodium is a genus of ferns, directly addressing half of the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Phlebodium aureum" context: Although this context focuses on a specific species within the Phlebodium genus, it supports the information that Phlebodium is indeed a fern, adding to the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 3. "Pieris (plant)" context: This context is relevant as it addresses the second half of the claim regarding Pieris. However, it states that Pieris is a genus of shrubs in the family Ericaceae, not a fern, providing a clear answer to the claim. 4. "Tree fern" context: This context is informative about tree ferns but does not directly address the claim about Phlebodium and Pieris being ferns.

Question:Bartlett's Bridge was built by the engineer who worked for the county seat of which Massachusetts county?
golden idx: [1, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim about Bartlett's Bridge and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Bartlett's Bridge" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Bartlett's Bridge and provides information about its construction and the engineer who designed it, Charles A. Allen, who worked for the city of Worcester. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Worcester, Massachusetts" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Worcester, which is connected to the engineer Charles A. Allen who designed Bartlett's Bridge. It provides background information about Worcester and its status as the county seat of Worcester County, which is likely to be useful in answering the claim. 3. "Henry Covered Bridge (Ohio)" context: This context mentions a bridge near Bartlett, Ohio, which could be confused with Bartlett's Bridge. However, it is less relevant because it does not mention the engineer or the Massachusetts county. 4. "Shinn Covered Bridge" context: This context is about a bridge in the same state as Bartlett's Bridge, but it does not mention the engineer or the county seat, making it less relevant. 5. "Eisenhower Bridge (Milton, Iowa)" context: This context is about bridge construction and mentions an engineer, but it is not directly related to the claim about Bartlett's Bridge or the county seat in Massachusetts. 6. "Sutliff Bridge" context: This context is about a bridge and its engineer, but it is in Iowa and not related to the claim about Massachusetts. 7.

The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not mention bridges, engineers, or county seats related to the claim.

step-by-step think: 1. "Bartlett's Bridge" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Bartlett's Bridge and the engineer Charles A. Allen, who worked for the city of Worcester. Since Worcester is the county seat of Worcester County, this context is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Worcester, Massachusetts" context: This context is directly relevant because it identifies Worcester as the county seat of Worcester County, which is the answer to the claim. 3. "Gardnerville Branch Jail" context: While this context discusses a county seat, it is about Gardnerville, Nevada, and not related to the claim about Massachusetts. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Cerro Gordo County Courthouse (Iowa)" context: This context is about the county seat of Cerro Gordo County in Iowa, which is not relevant to the claim about a county seat in Massachusetts. It is informative but unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. The remaining contexts are about bridges and locations that are not relevant to the claim about Bartlett's Bridge and the county seat in Massachusetts.
idx: [6, 1, 0, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 6: This context is highly relevant as it provides detailed information about Bartlett's Bridge, including the engineer Charles A. Allen who designed it and his affiliation with the city of Worcester, which is the county seat of Worcester County. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 1: This context is relevant because it mentions Worcester, Massachusetts, which is the county seat of Worcester County. It provides background information about the city and its status as a county seat, which is directly related to the claim. 3.

However, it is included as the third context because it discusses the concept of a county seat, which is part of the claim, but it is less likely to contain the answer compared to the first two contexts. Context idx 0 is not relevant as it pertains to a location in Nevada, which is unrelated to the claim about Massachusetts.

Context 6 is the second most relevant because it confirms Chris McKay's role in directing "The Lego Batman Movie," which is the subject of the claim. 3. The remaining contexts mention other individuals' directorial debuts and their respective producers, but since they are not related to Chris McKay or "The Lego Batman Movie," they are not directly relevant to the claim. However, they are ranked based on the detail of information provided about the film and its production. 4. Context 4 provides detailed information about Brandon Dickerson's directorial debut and his producers, making it the next most informative. 5. Context 1 follows as it gives specific details about the film "Afflicted" and its directors. 6.

It also lists the producers of the movie, directly answering the claim. 2. "Chris McKay" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about Chris McKay's career and mentions his directorial debut with "The Lego Batman Movie," but it does not list the producers. 3.

golden idx: [2, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about Ivory Lee Brown's nephew and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context 6: This context is directly about Ivory Lee Brown and mentions that he is the uncle of Adrian Peterson, which is highly relevant to the claim. 2. Context 2: This context talks about Adrian Peterson, who is the nephew of Ivory Lee Brown, and mentions his achievement in the Heisman Trophy balloting, which is likely to contain the answer. 3. Context 7: The "Heisman curse" context may not directly answer the claim, but it is informative about the Heisman Trophy's history and implications, which could be indirectly relevant. 4. Context 1: Kurt Burris's context is relevant to the Heisman Trophy but less likely to contain the specific answer about Ivory Lee Brown's nephew. 5. Context 3: Casey Weldon's context is similar in relevance to Kurt Burris's, as it pertains to the Heisman Trophy but not directly to the claim. 6. Context 4: Darnell Autry's context is informative about the Heisman Trophy balloting but less directly related to the claim. 7. Context 5: The 1964 Illinois Fighting Illini football team context discusses Heisman Trophy balloting but is less likely to contain the answer. 8. Context 0: Reds Bagnell's context is the least relevant as it does not mention Ivory Lee Brown or his nephew, but it is still related to the Heisman Trophy. The remaining contexts (8 and 9) are not included as they are less relevant than the top 8.
idx: [6,2,7,1,3,4,5,0]

step-by-step think: The claim is about a "first" credited to Ivory Lee Brown's nephew in Heisman Trophy balloting. To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer:
1. Context idx 2 ("Adrian Peterson"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Adrian Peterson, who is the nephew of Ivory Lee Brown. It states that Peterson was the first freshman to finish as the runner-up in the Heisman Trophy balloting, which directly answers the claim.
2. Context idx 6 ("Ivory Lee Brown"): This context is relevant because it establishes the relationship between Ivory Lee Brown and Adrian Peterson, confirming that Peterson is indeed Brown's nephew.
3. Context idx 7 ("Heisman curse"): While this context discusses the Heisman Trophy, it does not directly address the claim about the "first" for which Peterson was credited.
4. Context idx 1 ("Kurt Burris"): This context is informative about the Heisman Trophy balloting history but does not directly relate to the claim about Peterson's "first."
5. Context idx 3 ("Casey Weldon"), idx 4 ("Darnell Autry"), idx 5 ("1964 Illinois Fighting Illini football team"), and idx 0 ("Reds Bagnell"): These contexts mention other individuals' achievements in the Heisman Trophy balloting but are not relevant to the claim about Peterson.

idx: [2, 6, 7, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Adrian Peterson" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Adrian Peterson, who is the nephew of Ivory Lee Brown. It provides detailed information about Peterson's achievements, including his record as a freshman and his runner-up position in the Heisman Trophy balloting, which is the specific "first" mentioned in the claim. 2. "Ivory Lee Brown" context: This context is relevant because it establishes the relationship between Ivory Lee Brown and Adrian Peterson, confirming that Peterson is indeed Brown's nephew. However, it does not mention the Heisman Trophy balloting directly. 3. "Kurt Burris" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses Kurt Burris's achievements related to the Heisman Trophy but does not mention Ivory Lee Brown or his nephew. It is included as the third context because it is related to the Heisman Trophy, which is the subject of the claim. 4. "Heisman curse" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses the Heisman curse and does not mention Ivory Lee Brown or his nephew, nor does it provide information about the specific "first" in the Heisman Trophy balloting.

Question:Haruki Murakami said that writing "Dance Dance Dance" had been a healing act after his unexpected fame following the publication of a novel published in which year ?
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: The claim is specifically about Haruki Murakami's statement regarding the novel "Dance Dance Dance" and its relation to his fame following the publication of another novel. The context that directly addresses this claim is the one that mentions "Dance Dance Dance" and the novel that brought him fame, which is "Norwegian Wood". Therefore, the context that contains information about "Dance Dance Dance" and "Norwegian Wood" will be ranked highest. 

1. Context idx 2: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions "Dance Dance Dance" and includes Murakami's statement about the novel being a healing act after the fame of "Norwegian Wood". It also specifies that "Norwegian Wood" was the novel that brought him unexpected fame, which is the key point of the claim.
2. Context idx 3: This context is relevant because it mentions "Norwegian Wood", the novel that brought Murakami fame, which is directly related to the claim.
3. Context idx 0: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions another novel by Murakami, "Pinball, 1973", and provides context about his earlier works, which could be informative in understanding his career trajectory.
4. Context idx 4: This context mentions "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle", another work by Murakami, and could provide additional insight into his writing style and themes, although it is less directly related to the claim.
5. Context idx 5: This context is about a video game and mentions "Dance Dance Revolution", which shares a keyword with the novel in question but is otherwise unrelated to the claim.
6. Context idx 6: Similar to idx 5, this context is about a video game that is not relevant to the claim.
7. Context idx 1: This context is about a "Dance Dance Revolution" video game with Disney songs, which is not relevant to the claim.
8. Context idx 9: This context is also about a "Dance Dance Revolution" video game, specifically with Mario, and does not relate to the claim.

The remaining contexts (idx 7 and idx 8) are not included in the top 8 as they are even less relevant to the claim than the others.

idx: [2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 6, 1, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the year of publication of a novel by Haruki Murakami that led to his unexpected fame, which he mentioned when discussing "Dance Dance Dance." 1. Context idx 2: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Dance Dance Dance" and directly addresses the claim, stating that Murakami wrote it after the fame from "Norwegian Wood." It also provides the publication year of "Dance Dance Dance," which is closely related to the timing of the fame mentioned in the claim. 2. Context idx 3: This context is relevant because it provides the publication year of "Norwegian Wood," the novel that brought Murakami unexpected fame. 3. Context idx 0: This context is less relevant as it talks about "Pinball, 1973," which is not the novel in question but is part of the same series as "A Wild Sheep Chase," which is connected to "Dance Dance Dance." 4. Context idx 4: This context mentions "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle," another novel by Murakami, but it does not directly relate to the claim about his fame or the novel "Dance Dance Dance." The other contexts (idx 5, 6, 1, 9) are about video games and are not relevant to the claim about Murakami's novels.
idx: [2, 3, 0, 4]

"Norwegian Wood (novel)" context: This context is relevant because it provides the publication year of "Norwegian Wood," which is the novel mentioned in the claim. However, it does not discuss the healing act or the connection to "Dance Dance Dance." 3. "Pinball, 1973" context: This context is less relevant as it does not mention "Dance Dance Dance" or the healing act. It is about a different novel by Murakami but is part of the same series that includes "A Wild Sheep Chase," which is connected to "Dance Dance Dance." 4. "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention "Dance Dance Dance," "Norwegian Wood," or the healing act. It is about a different novel published later and does not contribute to answering the claim.

golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: The context titled "Samoa" is highly relevant as it directly mentions Samoa, which has eleven administrative divisions, and is likely to contain the answer. The context titled "Gerald Reive" is also relevant as it mentions the Falkland Islands' victory over Samoa in the 2010 Commonwealth Games. The context titled "George Paice (bowls)" is similar to "Gerald Reive" and provides additional details about the victory over Samoa. The context titled "Falkland Islands at the 2010 Commonwealth Games" is relevant as it provides information about the Falkland Islands' participation in the 2010 Commonwealth Games. The context titled "2010 Commonwealth Games" provides background information about the event but does not directly address the claim. The context titled "Archery at the Commonwealth Games" is less relevant as it focuses on archery and does not mention the Falkland Islands or Samoa. The context titled "Falkland Islands official football team" is not relevant as it does not mention the 2010 Commonwealth Games or Samoa. The context titled "Falkland Islands at the 2014 Commonwealth Games" is not relevant as it focuses on the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

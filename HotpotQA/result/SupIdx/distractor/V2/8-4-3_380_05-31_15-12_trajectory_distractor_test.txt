Question:Who was born first, José Echegaray y Eizaguirre or P. J. O'Rourke?
golden idx: [0, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between José Echegaray y Eizaguirre and P. J. O'Rourke, we need to look at the contexts that provide their birth dates. Context 8 is the most relevant as it provides the birth date of José Echegaray y Eizaguirre (19 April 1832). Context 0 is the second most relevant, providing the birth date of P. J. O'Rourke (November 14, 1947). The other contexts are not directly relevant to the claim since they do not provide information on the birth dates of the individuals in question. However, context 6 and context 7 mention P. J. O'Rourke and could be considered next in relevance. Contexts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 do not pertain to the individuals in question and are therefore ranked lower.
idx: [8, 0, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "José Echegaray" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth and death dates of José Echegaray y Eizaguirre, which is crucial to determining who was born first. 2. "P. J. O'Rourke" context: This context is also highly relevant because it gives the exact birth date of P. J. O'Rourke, allowing for a direct comparison with José Echegaray's birth date. 3. "Give War a Chance" context: This context is related to P. J. O'Rourke but does not provide information about his birth date, making it less relevant than the previous contexts. 4. "National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody" context: This context is related to P. J. O'Rourke's work but, like the previous context, does not provide information about his birth date. It is therefore less relevant to the claim. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not pertain to the individuals in question.
idx: [8, 0, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "José Echegaray" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides specific birth and death dates for José Echegaray y Eizaguirre, directly addressing the claim about who was born first. 2. "P. J. O'Rourke" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the birth date of P. J. O'Rourke, which is necessary to answer the claim. 3. "National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody" context: While this context is about a work associated with P. J. O'Rourke, it does not provide information on his birth date, making it less relevant than the previous contexts. However, it is more relevant than the "Give War a Chance" context because it mentions P. J. O'Rourke's role in the creation of the book, which is more closely related to him as an individual. 4. "Give War a Chance" context: This context is the least relevant as it only mentions a book by P. J. O'Rourke without providing any personal details that would help answer the claim.

The most relevant context would be the one that directly mentions the 1994 FA Women's Cup Final and the teams that played.

Context 7 is also relevant as it mentions Doncaster Belles, one of the teams in the final. Context 5 mentions Glanford Park, the venue of the final, making it somewhat relevant. Context 4 mentions a final involving Doncaster Belles but from a different year, so it is less relevant than the previous contexts but still useful.

idx: [6, 7, 5, 4, 1, 9, 0, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. "1994 FA Women's Cup Final" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions the specific event in question, including the teams that played, the location, and the date. It is highly informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2.

While it does not directly mention the 1994 final, it is still relevant to the claim. 3. "Glanford Park" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the venue of the 1994 final. However, it does not provide information about the event itself or the teams that played. 4. "2002 FA Women's Cup Final" context: This context mentions the Doncaster Belles in a different FA Women's Cup Final, which indicates a pattern of participation in such events, but it is less relevant than the contexts that directly relate to the 1994 final.
idx: [6, 7, 5, 4]

step-by-step think:1. Context with idx 6: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the 1994 FA Women's Cup Final, the teams involved, and the location, which is Glanford Park. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context with idx 7: This context provides information about the Doncaster Rovers Belles L.F.C., which is relevant to the claim but does not directly address the specific match in question. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to context idx 6. 3. Context with idx 5: This context mentions Glanford Park, the location of the final, which makes it relevant. However, it does not mention the teams or the event in question, making it less likely to contain the answer than contexts idx 6 and 7. 4. Context with idx 4: This context is about a different FA Women's Cup Final held in 2002, which is not relevant to the 1994 final. Therefore, it is the least likely to contain the answer to the claim.

golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for an act associated with Innocent Records that achieved Platinum sales and shares its name with a primary color in the RGB color model. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions Innocent Records and the act's name, which should be a primary color. 1. Context idx 6: This context directly mentions Innocent Records and includes the act "Blue" which achieved Platinum sales. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 0: This context is about the color Blue, which is a primary color in the RGB color model and is the name of the act mentioned in the claim. It is relevant and informative. 3. Context idx 5: This context talks about the RGB color model, which is relevant to the claim as it specifies the color model where the primary color should come from. 4. Context idx 7: This context discusses the RGB color space, which is related to the RGB color model mentioned in the claim. 5. Context idx 1: This context mentions RGBA color space, which is a variation of the RGB color model and could be informative regarding the primary colors. 6.

Context idx 4: This context discusses HCL color space, which is a translation of RGB color space and could be indirectly relevant. 8. Context idx 9: This context talks about color space in general, which is less directly related to the claim but still provides background information on color models.
idx: [6,0,5,7,1,2,4,9]

step-by-step think:1. "Innocent Records" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Innocent Records and specifically names acts that achieved Platinum sales, including Blue, which shares its name with a primary color in the RGB color model. It directly answers the claim. 2. "Blue" context: This context is about the color blue itself and its properties within the RGB color model. While informative about the color, it does not address the music act Blue or its achievements. However, it is relevant due to the mention of Blue as a primary color in the RGB model. 3. "RGB color model" context: This context explains the RGB color model, which is relevant to the claim since it specifies the model where blue is a primary color. However, it does not mention Innocent Records or the act Blue. 4. "RGB color space" context: Similar to the RGB color model context, this one is relevant to the understanding of the RGB color space but does not provide information about the act Blue or its achievements. It is less directly related to the claim than the "Innocent Records" and "Blue" contexts.
idx: [6, 0, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 6 mentions Innocent Records and specifically notes that the act "Blue" achieved Platinum sales, which directly answers the claim. It is highly relevant and informative. 2. Context idx 0 is about the color "Blue," which is a primary color in the RGB color model and shares its name with the act mentioned in context idx 6. This context is relevant as it connects the name of the act to the RGB color model. 3. Context idx 5 discusses the RGB color model, which is relevant to the claim but does not mention the act "Blue" or its sales achievements. It is informative regarding the RGB model but less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to idx 6 and 0.

Context idx 6: "Cold Spring, New York" is relevant because it mentions Cold Spring, a village in the town of Philipstown, and talks about the Cold Spring Historic District. 3. Context idx 7: "Greater Newport Rural Historic District" is less relevant as it is located in Virginia, not New York. 4. Context idx 9: "Glimmerglass Historic District" is in New York but not near Philipstown; it is less likely to contain the answer. 5.

Although it does not directly mention the national historic district in question, its proximity to the location in the claim makes it potentially useful. 3. "Glimmerglass Historic District" context: This context is less relevant than the first two, as it is located near Cooperstown, which is not in Philipstown. However, it is still in New York and mentions a national historic district, which could be useful for comparison or additional context. 4. "Elmwood Historic District–East" context: This context is relevant to the extent that it describes a national historic district in New York, but it is located in Buffalo, which is far from Philipstown.

The "Elmwood Historic District–East" context is not included in the top 3 as it is located in Buffalo, which is not near Philipstown, New York, and therefore is not relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [1, 4]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the city where the Danish band that released "Dead but Rising" was formed in 2001. Context 4 directly answers this by stating that Volbeat, the band that released "Dead but Rising," was formed in Copenhagen in 2001. This context is the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. Context 1 mentions the song "Dead but Rising" but does not provide information about the formation of the band or the city, making it less relevant than context 4. Context 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not mention "Dead but Rising" or Volbeat's formation and are therefore not relevant to the claim.
idx: [4, 1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 4 ("Volbeat"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Volbeat is a Danish band formed in Copenhagen in 2001, which directly answers the claim about the city where the band was formed. 2. Context idx 1 ("Dead but Rising"): This context is relevant because it mentions the song "Dead but Rising" by Volbeat, though it does not mention the city of formation, it is closely related to the claim. 3. Context idx 5 ("Home Dead (album)"): This context is less relevant as it mentions a different Danish band and an album from 2001, but does not provide information about Volbeat or the city of formation. 4. Context idx 3 ("Life of a Ghost"): This context is also less relevant as it discusses another Danish band and their work, but again, it does not provide information about Volbeat's city of formation.
idx: [4, 1, 5, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. "Volbeat" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the band Volbeat and provides information about their formation in Copenhagen in 2001, which directly answers the claim. 2. "Dead but Rising" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the song "Dead but Rising" by Volbeat, but it does not provide information about the city of formation, which is the specific detail asked in the claim. 3. "Home Dead (album)" context: This context is about a different Danish band and an album released in 2001. It is less relevant because it does not pertain to Volbeat or the song "Dead but Rising", but it mentions the year 2001, which is related to the timeframe of the claim. 4. "Life of a Ghost" context: This context is about another Danish band and does not mention Volbeat or the song "Dead but Rising". It is the least relevant to the claim.

"Hätteberget" context: This context is not relevant as it discusses a lighthouse and mentions a white sector in a different context. 8. "Holden-Keating Gang" context: This context is not relevant as it discusses a criminal gang and uses the term spokesman in a different context. 9. "Curtis Glencross" context: This context is not relevant as it discusses a hockey player who was a spokesman for the Special Olympics. 10. "Vance Powell" context: This context is not relevant as it discusses a record producer and engineer with no connection to the claim.
idx: [5, 1, 0, 6, 2, 4, 3, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking about the man associated with the award that "Summer of the Monkeys" won, specifically inquiring if he was a spokesman for the white sector of America. 1. "William Allen White" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions William Allen White, who is associated with the award named after him, which "Summer of the Monkeys" won. It also states that White became a spokesman for middle America. 2. "Summer of the Monkeys" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it mentions the book "Summer of the Monkeys" and the award it won, which is the William Allen White Book Award. 3. "Horace Bumstead" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it discusses Horace Bumstead's role as a spokesman for African American education, which could be confused with the claim's reference to a spokesman for the white sector. However, it does not directly answer the claim. 4. "Holden-Keating Gang" context: This context is less relevant but is included because it mentions a spokesman for the FBI describing someone as a menace to every American, which indirectly relates to the concept of a spokesman for a sector of America.
idx: [5,1,0,7]

step-by-step think: 1. "William Allen White" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions William Allen White and describes his role as a spokesman, which is directly related to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Summer of the Monkeys" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the book "Summer of the Monkeys" and the award associated with William Allen White. It provides information about the award which is central to the claim. 3. "Horace Bumstead" context: While this context mentions a white spokesman for African American education, it is less relevant because it does not connect to the book "Summer of the Monkeys" or the specific award mentioned in the claim. 4. "Holden-Keating Gang" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a criminal gang and an FBI spokesman, which are unrelated to the claim about the award and "Summer of the Monkeys."

Context idx 1: It talks about the Jeep Liberty (KK) and the transition back to the name "Cherokee", which is somewhat relevant. 8. Context idx 3: This context is about the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which, while related, is a different model from the original Cherokee but still holds some relevance.
idx: [9,0,7,2,4,6,1,3]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the original sale period of the Jeep Cherokee as a variant of another Jeep model. 1. "Jeep Cherokee (SJ)" context: This context is highly relevant as it specifies the Jeep Cherokee SJ series was produced from 1974 through 1983, directly answering the claim. 2. "Jeep Cherokee" context: This context mentions that the Jeep Cherokee was originally sold as a variant of the Jeep Wagoneer and has been in continuous use since 1974, which is highly relevant to the claim. 3. "Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the Jeep Wagoneer, the model of which the Cherokee was a variant, and its production period from 1963 to 1991. 4. "Jeep Cherokee (XJ)" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it talks about the evolution of the Cherokee model starting from 1983, which is after the period in question but provides background on the continuity of the Cherokee line.
idx: [7, 9, 0, 2]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 9: This context provides a comprehensive overview of the Jeep Cherokee's history, mentioning its evolution and continuous use since 1974, which directly addresses the claim. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: This context is about the SJ series Jeep Cherokee, produced from 1974 through 1983, which is relevant to the claim. However, it is slightly less informative than context idx 9 regarding the continuous use of the nameplate. 3. Context idx 2: This context discusses the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) model, which was produced from 1983 to 2001. It is relevant as it shares the name of the original SJ model, but it does not address the claim about the original variant's production years as directly as the other contexts.

step-by-step think: To determine which writer has the highest number of skills, we need to look for contexts that provide comprehensive information about the achievements, awards, and overall contributions of Langston Hughes and Ian McEwan. Contexts that mention their works, influence, and recognition in the literary world will be most relevant.

8. Context idx 7: "Black Nativity" showcases Hughes' skills as a playwright and his impact on theatre, making it relevant to the claim.

The remaining contexts are less directly related to the claim or do not provide specific information about the writers' skills. Therefore, they are not included in the top 8 ranked contexts.

idx: [9, 6, 5, 2, 3, 1, 4, 7]

step-by-step think: The claim asks which writer, Langston Hughes or Ian McEwan, has the highest number of skills. To determine this, we need to evaluate the contexts for mentions of their skills, achievements, and recognitions that could indicate their level of skill.
1. "Ian McEwan" context: This context mentions Ian McEwan's recognition as one of the greatest British writers and his ranking in British culture, which suggests a high level of skill.
2. "Langston Hughes" context: This context provides information about Langston Hughes' multifaceted career, indicating a diverse set of skills.
3. "Langston Hughes Medal" context: The mention of an award named after Langston Hughes suggests his influence and skill level, but it does not directly compare his skills to Ian McEwan's.
4. "Langston Hughes Society" context: This context highlights the dedication of a society to Langston Hughes' work, suggesting his importance and skill, but again, it does not offer a direct comparison.
5. "I, Too (Langston Hughes poem)" context: This context discusses a specific work by Langston Hughes and its impact, indicating his skill as a poet.
6. "Le Conversazioni" context: This context mentions Ian McEwan among other notable writers, suggesting his prominence but not specifically his skill level.

"Langston Hughes" context: This context is also directly relevant as it provides information about Langston Hughes' career and influence, which are important factors in assessing his skill as a writer. 3.

However, it does indicate the impact and recognition of Hughes' work. 4.

Question:How large is the shopping mall where KGOT radio station has its studios ?
golden idx: [7, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the size of the shopping mall where the KGOT radio station is located. Context 8 directly mentions KGOT and its location in the Dimond Center, making it the most relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 7 describes the Dimond Center, providing specific details about its size, which is directly relevant to the claim. Context 3 mentions Tower City Center shopping mall, which includes a transit station and might be confused with a radio station, but it's less relevant since it's not related to KGOT. Contexts 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 mention various shopping malls, but none of them are related to KGOT or its location. They provide general information about different malls and are therefore less relevant to the claim. The ranking should prioritize the contexts that mention KGOT and the Dimond Center, followed by those that provide detailed information about shopping malls, as they might indirectly help in deducing the size by comparison if more direct information wasn't available.
idx: [8, 7, 3, 1, 0, 2, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the size of the shopping mall where KGOT radio station has its studios. 1. "Dimond Center" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Dimond Center, which is the location of the KGOT radio station's studios, and provides the exact size of the mall. It is the most informative and directly answers the claim. 2. "KGOT" context: This context is relevant because it confirms that KGOT's studios are located in the Dimond Center, which is the subject of the claim. However, it does not provide the size of the mall. 3. "Kentucky Oaks Mall" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different mall and includes a radio station, but it is not related to KGOT or the Dimond Center. 4. "Park City Center" context: This context is also less relevant because it describes another mall that is not related to the claim. The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not pertain to the Dimond Center or KGOT radio station.
idx: [7, 8, 5, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Dimond Center" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Dimond Center, where KGOT radio station has its studios. It provides specific information about the size of the mall, which directly answers the claim. 2. "KGOT" context: This context is relevant because it confirms that KGOT radio station is located in the Dimond Center, supporting the information provided in the first context. However, it does not provide the size of the mall, which is the main focus of the claim. 3. "Park City Center" context: While this context provides detailed information about the Park City Center, it is not relevant to the claim since it does not mention KGOT radio station or the Dimond Center. 4. "Kentucky Oaks Mall" context: This context is informative about the Kentucky Oaks Mall, but it is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention KGOT radio station or the Dimond Center.

It may not directly answer the claim but is informative. 4.

Context 3 mentions the film "Fugitive in Trieste" in which Jacques Sernas starred, but does not provide information about his nationality. 3. Context 1 mentions another film starring Jacques Sernas and provides context about his career, which could be informative regarding his nationality. 4. Context 2 also mentions a film starring Jacques Sernas and could provide additional context about his background. The remaining contexts mention films involving Jacques Sernas but are less likely to contain information about his nationality.
idx: [0, 3, 1, 2]

step-by-step think: 1. "Jacques Sernas" context: This context is directly relevant to the claim as it mentions Jacques Sernas and provides specific information about his nationality, stating he was a Lithuanian-born French actor. It is highly informative and directly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Fugitive in Trieste" context: While this context mentions the film in which Jacques Sernas acted, it does not provide information about his nationality. It is relevant to the claim but less likely to contain the answer compared to the context that directly mentions his nationality. 3. "Finishing School (1953 film)" context: This context mentions another film starring Jacques Sernas and provides some details about the production. It is somewhat relevant but does not contain information about his nationality. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim than the context that directly addresses his nationality.

Question:The VMAQT-1 logo is a female spirit in Irish mythology who heralds the death of what?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim specifically mentions the VMAQT-1 logo and a female spirit in Irish mythology known for heralding death. The most directly relevant context is idx 6, which explicitly mentions the VMAQT-1 and identifies the Banshee as its logo. The next most relevant is idx 3, which provides detailed information about the Banshee, the figure in question. Following these, idx 1 is somewhat relevant as it discusses Irish mythology but not the Banshee specifically. The remaining contexts mention various female spirits from different mythologies and cultures, which are less relevant to the claim. Therefore, idx 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 would follow in order of decreasing relevance based on the specific details they provide about female spirits and their connection to the claim's focus on Irish mythology and the concept of heralding death.
idx: [6, 3, 1, 0, 2, 4, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 6: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the VMAQT-1 logo and identifies it as the Banshee, which is the answer to the claim. It also provides additional information about the squadron and its motto, which is related to the concept of foretelling death. 2. Context idx 3: This context is about the Banshee and explains its role in Irish mythology, which is directly related to the claim. It provides a detailed description of the Banshee, making it highly informative and likely to contain the answer. 3. Context idx 1: The Fomorians context is related to Irish mythology but does not directly address the claim about the Banshee or the VMAQT-1 logo. It is less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. Context idx 2: The context about Picobrouwerij Alvinne mentions a female spirit associated with the brewery's logo, which is somewhat relevant since the claim involves a logo and a female spirit. However, it is not directly about the Banshee or VMAQT-1.
idx: [6, 3, 1, 2]

step-by-step think: 1. "VMAQT-1" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the VMAQT-1 logo and describes it as the Banshee, which is the female spirit in question. It also provides the motto of the squadron, which is related to the concept of foretelling death, making it very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Banshee" context: This context is also highly relevant because it defines what a banshee is in Irish mythology, directly addressing the claim's focus on the female spirit that heralds death. It is informative and supports the information provided in the VMAQT-1 context. 3. "Picobrouwerij Alvinne" context: While this context mentions a female spirit associated with a brewery's logo, it is less directly related to the claim than the first two contexts. However, it is still somewhat relevant because it involves a logo and a female spirit from folklore. 4. "Fomorians" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a different aspect of Irish mythology that does not pertain to the Banshee or the concept of heralding death, making it unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:The actress that played the leading role in the independent film "A Perfect Ending" also stars with John Bregar in a 2008 film directed by who?
golden idx: [0, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the context that directly mentions both the film "A Perfect Ending" and the actress Barbara Niven, as she is the lead actress in the film. This context is most relevant to the claim. Next, I look for contexts that mention John Bregar and a 2008 film, as these are also key parts of the claim. The context that mentions a film from 2008 with both Barbara Niven and John Bregar is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. I then consider the remaining contexts for their relevance to the claim, prioritizing those that mention either the film "A Perfect Ending," Barbara Niven, John Bregar, or films from 2008. Contexts that do not mention any of these elements are ranked lower as they are less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

idx: [5,0,7,4,2,3,6,1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Dead at 17" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both Barbara Niven and John Bregar, who starred in the 2008 film directed by Douglas Jackson. It directly answers the claim. 2. "Barbara Niven" context: This context is relevant because it confirms Barbara Niven's role in "A Perfect Ending" and establishes her as the actress in question. However, it does not mention the 2008 film with John Bregar. 3. "Steve Arbuckle" context: This context mentions John Bregar and his acting career, which is somewhat relevant but does not provide information about the 2008 film or the director in question. 4. "Sebastián Mantilla" context: This context is about a director and his works, which could be relevant to the claim, but it does not mention the 2008 film or the actors in question. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to the contexts that mention the film or the actors directly.
idx: [5, 0, 7, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. Context from 'Dead at 17': This context is highly relevant as it mentions both Barbara Niven and John Bregar, who are central to the claim. It also specifies that the film was directed by Douglas Jackson, directly answering the question posed in the claim. 2. Context from 'Barbara Niven': This context is relevant because it confirms Barbara Niven's role in "A Perfect Ending," which is part of the claim. However, it does not provide information about the 2008 film or the director, making it less relevant than the first context. 3. Context from 'Steve Arbuckle': This context mentions John Bregar and provides background on another actor, Steve Arbuckle. It is less relevant because it does not mention "A Perfect Ending" or the 2008 film in question. 4. Context from 'Sebastián Mantilla': This context is the least relevant as it does not mention the actors or films in question and is focused on a different director and his works.

Question:Which band is from England, Fireflight or Dirty Pretty Things?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim asks which band is from England, Fireflight or Dirty Pretty Things. To answer this, we need to identify the contexts that mention the origin of these bands. 

1. "Dirty Pretty Things (band)" context: This context directly states that Dirty Pretty Things were an English band, which is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 
2. "Carl Barât" context: This context mentions that Carl Barât, a member of Dirty Pretty Things, is a British musician, which supports the information about the band's origin.
3. "Bang Bang You're Dead (song)" context: The song is by Dirty Pretty Things and charted in the UK, suggesting the band's activity in England, which is somewhat relevant.
4. "Didz Hammond" context: This context talks about Didz Hammond, an English bassist for Dirty Pretty Things, further confirming the band's English origin.
5. "Anthony Rossomando" context: Although Anthony Rossomando is American, his association with Dirty Pretty Things supports the band's relevance to the claim.
6. "Johanna Bennett" context: Johanna Bennett is an English musician associated with Dirty Pretty Things, which is tangentially relevant.
7. "Deadwood (song)" context: Another song by Dirty Pretty Things, indicating the band's activity but less directly answering the claim.
8. "Wondering (Dirty Pretty Things song)" context: Similar to the other song contexts, it is related but not directly answering the claim about the band's origin.
9. "Fireflight" context: This context clearly states that Fireflight is an American band, which directly answers the claim by process of elimination.
10. "Mirage (Digitalism album)" context: This context is about a German electronic music duo and is not relevant to the claim.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the contexts are ranked with the most relevant and informative contexts first.

idx: [3, 8, 0, 7, 4, 1, 6, 9]

step-by-step think: To determine which band is from England, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Dirty Pretty Things (band)" context: This context is highly relevant as it explicitly states that Dirty Pretty Things were an English band, directly answering the claim. 2. "Carl Barât" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about Carl Barât, who is a key member of Dirty Pretty Things, and mentions his association with the band, reinforcing the answer to the claim. 3. "Didz Hammond" context: This context is informative as it discusses Didz Hammond's role in Dirty Pretty Things, contributing to the understanding of the band's English origin. 4. "Bang Bang You're Dead (song)" context: This context mentions a song by Dirty Pretty Things, which indirectly supports the band's origin by association but is less direct than the previous contexts.
idx: [3, 8, 7, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. "Dirty Pretty Things (band)" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Dirty Pretty Things is an English band, directly answering the claim. It provides detailed information about the band's formation, members, and activities, making it highly likely to contain the answer. 2. "Carl Barât" context: This context is also relevant because it discusses Carl Barât, who is a key member of Dirty Pretty Things. It provides additional information about his role in the band and his nationality, supporting the answer to the claim. 3. "Didz Hammond" context: This context is relevant as it talks about Didz Hammond, another member of Dirty Pretty Things, and his role in the band. It adds further detail to the band's background, which is useful for answering the claim. The "Bang Bang You're Dead (song)" context is less relevant because it focuses on a single song rather than the band's origin, which is central to the claim.

Question:The Bart the Fink episode of The Simpsons aired in February of 1996, and involves the host of which kiddie show?
golden idx: [1, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the "Bart the Fink" episode of The Simpsons, which aired in February 1996 and involves the host of a kiddie show. To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer. 

1. Context idx 9 ("Bart the Fink"): This context is directly about the "Bart the Fink" episode, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 1 ("Krusty the Clown"): This context is about Krusty the Clown, who is a kiddie show host in The Simpsons, making it relevant and likely to contain the answer.
3. Context idx 2 ("The Itchy & Scratchy Show"): This context is related to "The Krusty the Clown Show" and could provide additional information about the kiddie show mentioned in the claim.
4. Context idx 0 ("Bart to the Future"): While this context is about an episode of The Simpsons, it is not directly related to "Bart the Fink" or a kiddie show host.
5. Context idx 4 ("The Telltale Head"): This context is about an episode of The Simpsons but does not seem to be related to the claim about a kiddie show host.
6. Context idx 5 ("Bart Gets Hit by a Car"): This context is about an episode of The Simpsons and does not mention a kiddie show host.
7. Context idx 3 ("Good Night (The Simpsons short)"): This context is about the first Simpsons short but does not relate to the claim.
8. Context idx 8 ("Postcards from the Wedge"): This context is about an episode of The Simpsons but does not mention a kiddie show host.

The remaining contexts (idx 6 and 7) are not related to The Simpsons and are therefore not likely to contain the answer to the claim.

idx: [9, 1, 2, 0, 4, 5, 3, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 9 ("Bart the Fink"): This context is highly relevant as it directly discusses the "Bart the Fink" episode, including its air date and plot, which involves Krusty the Clown, the host of the kiddie show in question. 2. Context idx 1 ("Krusty the Clown"): This context is also highly relevant because it provides detailed information about Krusty the Clown, who is the host of the kiddie show that is central to the claim. 3. Context idx 2 ("The Itchy & Scratchy Show"): This context is relevant as it describes "The Itchy & Scratchy Show," which is a part of "The Krusty the Clown Show," thus indirectly related to the claim. 4. Context idx 4 ("The Telltale Head"): This context is less relevant as it discusses an episode from the first season and does not directly relate to the claim about "Bart the Fink." However, it does mention Bart's interaction with the show, which could be tangentially related. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim and are therefore ranked lower.
idx: [9, 1, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Bart the Fink" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to the claim, mentioning the specific episode "Bart the Fink" and providing a detailed summary of the episode's plot, which includes Krusty the Clown's role. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Krusty the Clown" context: This context is also relevant because it provides information about Krusty the Clown, who is the host of the kiddie show mentioned in the claim. It offers background information on Krusty's character and his show, which is pertinent to the claim. 3. "The Itchy & Scratchy Show" context: While this context is about the show within a show that Krusty hosts, it is less directly related to the claim than the previous two contexts. However, it still provides useful information about the show that is part of Krusty's TV show, making it somewhat relevant.

Question:Which mall, Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam, has had more owners?
golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine which mall, Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam, has had more owners, I will focus on contexts that specifically mention ownership history. 1. "Viaport Rotterdam" context: This context is highly relevant as it details the ownership changes of Viaport Rotterdam, mentioning multiple owners over the years. 2. "Wilton Mall" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions that Wilton Mall was purchased by Macerich from Wilmorite Properties in 2004, indicating a change in ownership. 3. "Saratoga Mall" context: While this context mentions a mall in Wilton, it does not provide ownership history and is less relevant to the claim. 4. "Hubert Wilton" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses an individual named Hubert Wilton rather than the mall. 5. "Birchwood Mall" context: This context is about Birchwood Mall and does not provide information on the ownership history of either Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam. 6. "Eastland Mall (Charlotte, North Carolina)" context: This context is about Eastland Mall and does not relate to the claim. 7. "Karcher Mall" context: This context is about Karcher Mall and does not relate to the claim. 8. "Original Outlet Mall" context: This context is about Original Outlet Mall and does not relate to the claim. 9. "Pierre Bossier Mall" context: This context is about Pierre Bossier Mall and does not relate to the claim. 10. "ViaPort Florida" context: This context is about ViaPort Florida and does not relate to the claim.
idx: [0, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: To determine which mall, Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam, has had more owners, I will analyze the contexts provided for each mall. 1. "Viaport Rotterdam" context: This context is highly relevant as it details the ownership history of Viaport Rotterdam, mentioning multiple ownership changes from Wilmorite Properties to The Macerich Company, then to Kohan Retail Investment Group, and finally to Via Properties. It is informative and directly addresses the claim. 2. "Wilton Mall" context: This context is also relevant as it provides information on the ownership of Wilton Mall, stating that it is currently owned by Macerich and was previously owned by Wilmorite Properties. It is less informative than the Viaport Rotterdam context in terms of the number of owners. 3. "Saratoga Mall" context: While this context mentions a mall in the same region (Wilton), it does not provide information about the ownership history of either Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam. It is less relevant to the claim. 4. The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not pertain to either Wilton Mall or Viaport Rotterdam.
idx: [0, 6, 5, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Viaport Rotterdam" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides a detailed ownership history of Viaport Rotterdam, which is directly related to the claim. It mentions multiple owners over the years, which is crucial for determining the number of owners. 2. "Wilton Mall" context: This context is also relevant because it provides ownership information about Wilton Mall. It mentions that the mall was purchased from Wilmorite Properties by Macerich in 2004, which is essential for comparing the number of owners between the two malls. 3. "Saratoga Mall" context: While this context is about a mall in the same region, it is less relevant because it does not provide direct information about the ownership history of either Viaport Rotterdam or Wilton Mall. However, it is included because it mentions the demolition of a mall that could be confused with Wilton Mall, thus providing some indirect context. 4. "Birchwood Mall" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not pertain to either of the malls in question and therefore is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

The context must mention a connection to the Timberwolves and a close friendship with an American former basketball player. 1.

It is somewhat relevant because it discusses another player's signing with the Timberwolves, but it does not mention Garnett or his close friends. 4.

"Glasgow North East by-election, 2009" context: This context is less relevant as it pertains to a by-election in Glasgow North East, which is a different constituency. It is informative but not likely to contain the answer to the claim about the representative for Congleton. 4. "Jean-Marie Boisvert" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a Canadian politician from a different time period and political party, with no connection to the Congleton constituency or the UK House of Commons.

Question:Season 2 of Rick and Morty began with the episode directed by whom?
golden idx: [5, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the director of the first episode of Season 2 of "Rick and Morty". 1.

Context idx 6: This context is about Season 2 in general and mentions the premiere episode "A Rickle in Time", which is relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 0: This context mentions an episode from Season 2, indicating some relevance, but it is not the first episode. 4. Context idx 2: This context is about an episode from the show but not from Season 2, so it has less relevance. 5. Context idx 3: Similar to idx 2, this context is about the show but not the specific season or episode in question. 6. Context idx 4: This context is also about an episode of "Rick and Morty" but not the first episode of Season 2. 7. Context idx 7: This context is about the show but not the specific season or episode in question. 8. Context idx 8: This context is about the pilot episode, which is related to the show but not relevant to the claim about Season 2. The remaining contexts (idx 1 and 9) are not related to "Rick and Morty" and therefore are not ranked.
idx: [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 5: This context is the most relevant as it directly answers the claim by mentioning that "A Rickle in Time" is the first episode of the second season and was directed by Wes Archer. 2. Context idx 6: This context is relevant as it mentions the premiere of the second season with "A Rickle in Time", providing a direct link to the claim, but it does not mention the director. 3. Context idx 0: This context is about the sixth episode of the second season, which is less relevant to the claim about the first episode's director. 4. Context idx 7: This context is about the fifth episode of the first season, which is not relevant to the claim about the second season's first episode director.
idx: [5, 6, 0, 7]

step-by-step think: 1.

It is highly informative and directly answers the claim. 2. Context with idx 6: This context is relevant as it talks about the second season of "Rick and Morty" and mentions the premiere episode "A Rickle in Time". However, it does not mention the director, making it slightly less relevant than the first context. 3.

Question:What team did the recipient of the 2007 Brownlow Medal play for?
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the team of the 2007 Brownlow Medal recipient. Context 2 directly answers this by stating that Jimmy Bartel of the Geelong Football Club won the medal in 2007. Context 0 provides information about Jimmy Bartel, including his association with the Geelong Football Club, which is relevant to the claim. The other contexts are about different years of the Brownlow Medal and do not directly answer the claim but provide background information about the award and its recipients. Therefore, they are ranked based on their relevance to the award itself and the likelihood of containing information related to the claim.
idx: [2, 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 3]

step-by-step think: To determine the top 4 ranked contexts, I will consider the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim about the 2007 Brownlow Medal recipient's team. 1. Context idx 2: This context is directly relevant as it mentions the 2007 Brownlow Medal and states that Jimmy Bartel won the medal while playing for the Geelong Football Club. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 0: This context is about Jimmy Bartel and confirms his association with the Geelong Football Club, which is directly relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 1: This context discusses the 2011 Brownlow Medal, which is not directly relevant to the 2007 Brownlow Medal, but it is informative about the award's history. 4. Context idx 6: This context talks about the 2014 Brownlow Medal, which is less relevant than the contexts directly related to Jimmy Bartel and the 2007 Brownlow Medal, but still provides useful information about the award. The remaining contexts are about different years and do not directly answer the claim.
idx: [2, 0, 1, 6]

step-by-step think:1. Context with 'idx': 2 is the most relevant as it directly mentions the 2007 Brownlow Medal and states that Jimmy Bartel won the medal, which is the answer to the claim. 2. Context with 'idx': 0 is the second most relevant because it provides information about Jimmy Bartel, including his association with the Geelong Football Club, which is relevant to the claim. 3. Context with 'idx': 1, while it discusses the Brownlow Medal, it pertains to the year 2011 and not 2007, making it less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. Context with 'idx': 6 is about the 2014 Brownlow Medal and does not provide information about the 2007 medal or Jimmy Bartel, making it the least relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [0, 1]
step-by-step think: The claim asks whether both the Battle of Stones River and the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River were fought in the 19th century. Context 1 (idx: 1) directly addresses the Battle of Stones River, providing the exact dates it occurred, which were in the 19th century. Context 0 (idx: 0) addresses the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, giving the specific dates of the battle, which were in the 20th century. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. The remaining contexts do not directly address the claim but may contain information about the 19th century, which is tangentially relevant. Context 9 (idx: 9) mentions the Battle of Stones River within the context of an individual's actions during the battle, making it the next most relevant. Context 2 (idx: 2) talks about events in the 19th century, which is relevant to the timeframe of the claim. Context 4 (idx: 4) and Context 5 (idx: 5) also provide information about the 19th century but are less directly related to the claim than Context 2. Context 3 (idx: 3) and Context 8 (idx: 8) mention the 19th century but are even less directly related to the claim.

It is informative and contains the answer to the other half of the claim.
3. "Joseph L. Follett" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Joseph L. Follett's actions during the Battle of Stones River, which occurred in the 19th century. It supports the information provided in the first context but is less directly related to the claim.
4. "Military history of Mexico" context: This context is relevant to the claim as it discusses events in the 19th century, including the Mexican–American War. However, it does not directly address the battles in question but provides background information on the military history of the period.
The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not directly address the battles in question or the 19th century timeframe of the claim.

idx: [1, 0, 9, 8]

step-by-step think: The claim asks whether both the Battle of Stones River and the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River were fought in the 19th century. 1. "Battle of Stones River" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact dates of the Battle of Stones River, confirming it took place in the 19th century.

Bush" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions George H. W. Bush's tenure as Vice President and President, directly answering the claim. 2.

idx: [0,5,6,8,3,4,2,1]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how directly each context relates to the claim about Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush holding the same position in office. The most relevant contexts will mention both individuals and the positions they held. 1. "George H. W. Bush" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions George H. W. Bush's tenure as the 41st President and the 43rd Vice President, directly answering the claim. 2.

Context idx 8 directly mentions "The Bears and I" and its release date by Buena Vista Distribution, making it highly relevant. 2. Context idx 3 discusses the film "Oceans," but the release date mentioned is not 1974, so it's informative but less relevant to the specific claim. 3.

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the release date of two films, "The Bears and I" and "Oceans," specifically inquiring which one was released on July 31, 1974, by Buena Vista Distribution. To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the films and the distribution company mentioned in the claim.

"Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures" context: This context discusses the distributor in question, Buena Vista Distribution, and its history, which is relevant to the claim. However, it does not provide specific information about the release dates of the films in question, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim than the first two contexts.

Context 9 mentions the research team but does not specify the foundational book. The remaining contexts (0, 1, 3, 4) are not relevant to the claim as they discuss unrelated books or subjects.

step-by-step think: To address the claim about Mick Carter being the landlord of a public house and its address, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "The Queen Victoria" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions The Queen Victoria, the public house Mick Carter is the landlord of, and provides its fictional address. 2. "Mick Carter" context: This context is directly about Mick Carter and mentions him becoming the landlord of The Queen Victoria, which is crucial to the claim. 3. "Linda Carter" context: This context is relevant because it discusses Linda Carter, Mick's partner, and her role as landlady of The Queen Victoria, which is associated with the claim. 4. "Nancy Carter" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions Nancy Carter, Mick's daughter, and her connection to The Queen Victoria through her family. 5. "Whitney Dean" context: This context is less directly related but mentions Mick Carter and his relationship to Whitney, which could be tangentially related to the claim. 6. "Square and Compass, Worth Matravers" context: This context is about a different public house and is not directly related to the claim. 7. "Fat Cat Brewery" context: This context is about a brewery and public house but does not relate to Mick Carter or The Queen Victoria. 8. "The Gatehouse, Monmouth" context: This context is about another public house and is not relevant to the claim about Mick Carter. 9. "Shakespeare Public House, Bristol" context: This context is about a historic public house in Bristol and is not relevant to the claim. 10. "Adam & Eve, Birmingham" context: This context is about a former public house in Birmingham and is not relevant to the claim.
idx: [3,6,8,0,9,1,2,4]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about Mick Carter being the landlord of a public house and the likelihood of them containing the specific address:
1. Context idx 6: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Mick Carter becoming the landlord of The Queen Victoria public house, which is directly related to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer since it discusses his role in detail.
2. Context idx 3: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the specific address of The Queen Victoria, which is the public house in question. It directly answers the claim.
3. Context idx 8: This context mentions Linda Carter becoming landlady of The Queen Victoria and moving there with her family, which includes Mick Carter. It is relevant and may contain the answer, but it is less direct than the previous contexts.
4. Context idx 0: This context is relevant as it discusses Nancy Carter, the daughter of Mick Carter, and her connection to The Queen Victoria. However, it does not directly address the claim's focus on Mick Carter's address.
The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not pertain to Mick Carter or The Queen Victoria public house.

idx: [6, 3, 8, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "The Queen Victoria" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the specific address of The Queen Victoria, which is the public house Mick Carter is the landlord of. It directly answers the claim. 2. "Mick Carter" context: This context mentions Mick Carter becoming the landlord of The Queen Victoria and is relevant to the claim. However, it does not provide the specific address. 3. "Linda Carter" context: This context is relevant as it discusses Linda Carter's role as landlady and her move to The Queen Victoria, which is related to the claim but less directly than the context of The Queen Victoria itself. 4. "Nancy Carter" context: This context is the least relevant to the claim as it focuses on Nancy Carter's character and storylines without mentioning the address of The Queen Victoria.

Question:What television thriller anthology did the winner of one Golden Globe, two tony Awards and six Primetime Emmy Awards appear on?
golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the context that mentions a television thriller anthology series because the question specifically asks for it. Then, I will look for contexts that mention an individual with the exact number of awards specified in the claim. The context that matches both the type of show and the number of awards will be ranked highest. 

1. Context 0 ("Darkroom (TV series)"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions a television thriller anthology series and lists various actors. However, none of the actors mentioned have the exact combination of awards as specified in the claim.
2. Context 6 ("Brian Dennehy"): This context mentions an actor with one Golden Globe, two Tony Awards, and six Primetime Emmy Award nominations. It is highly relevant because the number of awards matches the claim, and Brian Dennehy appeared on "Darkroom," which is a television thriller anthology.
3. Context 3 ("John Lithgow"): This context mentions an actor with two Tony Awards and six Emmy Awards, which partially matches the claim. However, it does not specify the series, making it less likely to contain the answer.
4. Context 1 ("Al Pacino"): This context mentions an actor with two Tony Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards, which does not fully match the claim. Additionally, there is no mention of a television thriller anthology series.
5. Context 7 ("Laura Linney"): This context mentions an actress with four Primetime Emmy Awards, which does not match the claim. There is also no mention of a television thriller anthology series.
6. Context 4 ("Al Pacino on stage and screen"): This context is similar to context 1 and does not provide additional information relevant to the claim.
7. Context 8 ("Elisabeth Moss"): This context mentions an actress with six Emmy Awards nominations and a Golden Globe win, which does not match the claim. There is also no mention of a television thriller anthology series.
8. Context 9 ("Blythe Danner"): This context mentions an actress with two Primetime Emmy Awards, which does not match the claim. There is also no mention of a television thriller anthology series.
9. Context 2 ("Betty Suarez"): This context is about a character from a comedy-drama series, not a thriller anthology series, and does not match the claim.
10. Context 5 ("List of awards and nominations received by Lost"): This context is about a drama series and its awards, not a thriller anthology series, and does not match the claim.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the top 8 ranked contexts are:
idx: [6, 0, 3, 1, 7, 4, 8, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a television thriller anthology series that featured an actor who won one Golden Globe, two Tony Awards, and received six Primetime Emmy Award nominations. 
1. "Darkroom (TV series)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Darkroom," a television thriller anthology series, and lists Brian Dennehy as one of the performers. Since Brian Dennehy fits the description of the awards in the claim, this context is likely to contain the answer.
2. "Brian Dennehy" context: This context is about Brian Dennehy, who matches the description of the awards mentioned in the claim. However, it does not mention his appearance on a television thriller anthology, making it slightly less relevant than the "Darkroom" context.
3. "John Lithgow" context: John Lithgow has won two Tony Awards and six Emmy Awards, which partially matches the claim, but there is no mention of a television thriller anthology series, making it less relevant.
4. "Blythe Danner" context: Blythe Danner has won two Primetime Emmy Awards and a Tony Award, and she has appeared on television series, but the context does not mention a thriller anthology series, making it relevant but not as much as the "Darkroom" or "Brian Dennehy" contexts.
5. "Al Pacino" context: Al Pacino has won two Tony Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards, but there is no mention of his involvement in a television thriller anthology series, making it less relevant to the claim.
6. "Laura Linney" context: Laura Linney has won two Golden Globe Awards and four Primetime Emmy Awards, but again, there is no mention of a television thriller anthology series.
7. "Al Pacino on stage and screen" context: This is similar to the "Al Pacino" context and does not add any new information relevant to the claim.
8. "Elisabeth Moss" context: Elisabeth Moss has won a Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy Awards, but the context does not mention a thriller anthology series.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, the top four contexts are:
idx: [0, 6, 3, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. "Brian Dennehy" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Brian Dennehy, who fits the description of the claim with one Golden Globe, two Tony Awards, and six Primetime Emmy Award nominations. It is likely to contain the answer since it details his achievements and roles, including television appearances. 2. "Darkroom (TV series)" context: This context is relevant because it lists a television thriller anthology series and includes Brian Dennehy among the performers, directly linking to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "John Lithgow" context: This context is less relevant than the previous two because, while John Lithgow has a similar award profile to the claim, the text does not mention his appearance on a television thriller anthology series. However, it is still informative regarding his awards and could potentially contain the answer. The "Blythe Danner" context is not included in the top 3 as it does not mention her appearing on a television thriller anthology series, making it less relevant to the claim.

Question:What Cayman Islands registered Mandarin and Cantonese-language television broadcaster launched Phoenix Hong Kong Channel on 28 March 2011?
golden idx: [8, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about the Cayman Islands registered broadcaster that launched Phoenix Hong Kong Channel and the likelihood of the context containing the answer. 1. "Phoenix Television" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Phoenix Television as a Cayman Islands registered broadcaster and lists its channels, including Phoenix Hong Kong Channel. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Phoenix Hong Kong Channel" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it provides specific information about the launch of Phoenix Hong Kong Channel, its language offerings, and its broadcast methods. 3. "Walkers (law firm)" context: This context mentions a law firm based in the Cayman Islands with a branch in Hong Kong, which could be tangentially related to the claim but is less likely to contain the direct answer. 4. "Carey Olsen" context: Similar to the Walkers context, this mentions an offshore law firm with offices in the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong, making it somewhat relevant. 5. "Cayman Islands national rugby sevens team" context: This context mentions the Cayman Islands in relation to sports and includes a connection to Hong Kong, but it is not directly related to the claim. 6. "Cayman Islands at the 2011 Pan American Games" context: This context is relevant to the Cayman Islands during the time frame of interest but does not mention broadcasting or television. 7. "Cayman Islands Open 2011" context: This context is about a sports event in the Cayman Islands and is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 8. "Anthony Travers" context: This context mentions a figure associated with Cayman Islands finance and law but does not relate to broadcasting. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim and are therefore ranked lower.
idx: [9, 8, 0, 5, 3, 4, 1, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Phoenix Hong Kong Channel" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the launch of Phoenix Hong Kong Channel on the specific date in question, making it very likely to contain the answer. 2. "Phoenix Television" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Phoenix Television as a Cayman Islands registered broadcaster and lists its channels, including Phoenix Hong Kong Channel. 3. "Walkers (law firm)" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions a law firm based in the Cayman Islands with a branch in Hong Kong but does not relate to the television broadcaster or channel. 4. "Carey Olsen" context: Similar to the Walkers context, this mentions an offshore law firm with offices in the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong but is not directly related to the claim about the television broadcaster. 5. "Cayman Islands national rugby sevens team" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses the Cayman Islands rugby team's participation in sports events. 6. "Cayman Islands at the 2011 Pan American Games" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it focuses on the Cayman Islands' participation in the Pan American Games. 7. "Cayman Islands Open 2011" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a squash tournament held in the Cayman Islands. 8. "Anthony Travers" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it focuses on an individual's career and contributions to Cayman Islands law and finance.
idx: [8, 9, 0, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "Phoenix Television" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Phoenix Television as a Cayman Islands registered broadcaster that operates the Phoenix Hong Kong Channel, which is the subject of the claim. It provides comprehensive information about the broadcaster and its channels, making it very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Phoenix Hong Kong Channel" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it discusses the launch of the Phoenix Hong Kong Channel and its operations. It is informative and relevant, but it ranks slightly lower than the Phoenix Television context because it does not explicitly mention the broadcaster's registration details. 3. "Walkers (law firm)" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a law firm based in the Cayman Islands but does not mention the television broadcaster or the channel in question. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Carey Olsen" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses another law firm with operations in various locations, including the Cayman Islands. It does not mention the television broadcaster or the channel and is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:What is the name of the film starring Rose McGowan and features the character Earl McGraw's daughter?
golden idx: [4, 5]
step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts, I first identify which contexts mention both Rose McGowan and the character Earl McGraw or his daughter. Context 4, "Planet Terror," is the most relevant as it stars Rose McGowan and mentions Earl McGraw's daughter, Dakota. Context 5, "Earl and Edgar McGraw," is also highly relevant as it provides information about Earl McGraw's daughter, Dakota, who appears in "Planet Terror." The other contexts mention Rose McGowan but do not reference Earl McGraw or his daughter, making them less relevant to the specific claim. Therefore, I rank the contexts based on their relevance to both elements of the claim: Rose McGowan's involvement and the presence of Earl McGraw's daughter.
idx: [4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. "Planet Terror" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Rose McGowan as a star and also references the character Dakota, who is Earl McGraw's daughter. It is directly related to the claim and provides comprehensive information about the film. 2. "Earl and Edgar McGraw" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the characters Earl and Edgar McGraw and mentions that Earl has a daughter named Dakota, who appears in "Planet Terror". It is informative and connects directly to the characters in question. 3. "The Doom Generation" context: While this context mentions Rose McGowan, it does not reference Earl McGraw or his daughter, making it less relevant than the previous contexts. 4. "Devil in the Flesh (1998 film)" context: This context mentions a film starring Rose McGowan but does not provide any connection to Earl McGraw or his daughter, making it relevant only due to the actress's involvement. 5. "The Pastor's Wife (film)" context: This context is less relevant as it only mentions Rose McGowan and does not provide any information related to Earl McGraw or his daughter. 6. "Dead Awake (2010 film)" context: This context is similar to the previous one, mentioning Rose McGowan but not providing any relevant information about Earl McGraw or his daughter. 7. "Conan the Barbarian (2011 film)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Earl McGraw or his daughter, despite starring Rose McGowan. 8. "Scream (1996 film)" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on the film "Scream" and does not mention Earl McGraw or his daughter, even though Rose McGowan is part of the cast.
idx: [4, 5, 1, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Planet Terror" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the film "Planet Terror" which stars Rose McGowan and includes the character Dakota, who is Earl McGraw's daughter. It provides detailed information about the film and its connection to the "Grindhouse" films, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Earl and Edgar McGraw" context: This context is directly related to the characters Earl and Edgar McGraw and mentions their appearances in the "Grindhouse" project, including "Planet Terror". It also mentions Dakota, Earl's daughter, played by Marley Shelton, linking it to the claim. 3. "The Doom Generation" context: While this context mentions Rose McGowan, it does not relate to the character Earl McGraw or his daughter, making it less relevant than the first two contexts. However, it is still more relevant than the "Devil in the Flesh" context as it does not mention the McGraws at all.

Question:Chimaja Appawas the younger brother of a general of the Maratha Empire in India, who served as what to the fifth Maratha Chhatrapati Shahu from 1720 until his death?
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: The claim specifically asks for the role Chimaji Appa served to Chhatrapati Shahu. Context 2 directly mentions Chimaji Appa, his relationship to Bajirao Peshwa, and his military achievements, but does not specify his role to Shahu. Context 3 mentions Baji Rao I, who served as Peshwa to Shahu, which is closely related to the claim but is about a different person. Context 6 mentions Shahu I, providing background on Shahu which could be relevant to understanding the context of Chimaji Appa's role. Context 0 talks about Balaji Kunjar, a different Maratha Sardar and Minister, which is less directly related but still relevant to the Maratha administration. Context 1 discusses the Maratha Navy and Maynak Bhandari, which is less relevant to the claim. Context 4 provides general information about the Maratha Navy, which is not directly relevant. Context 5 discusses Balaji Vishwanath, the father of Chimaji Appa, which is somewhat relevant. Context 7 talks about Rajaram II, who was related to Shahu but does not provide information about Chimaji Appa's role. Context 8 gives an overview of the Maratha emperors and mentions the Peshwas, which could be indirectly relevant. Context 9 discusses the New Palace in Kolhapur and mentions Shahu, but it is not directly relevant to the claim.
idx: [2, 3, 6, 0, 5, 1, 8, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Chimaji Appa" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Chimaji Appa and provides information about his military achievements and his relation to Bajirao Peshwa. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim about his role to Chhatrapati Shahu. 2. "Baji Rao I" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Baji Rao I, the brother of Chimaji Appa, and his role as Peshwa to Chhatrapati Shahu. It provides context about the family and the era, which is informative. 3. "Shahu I" context: This context talks about Shahu I, the fifth Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire, which is directly related to the claim. It provides background information about Shahu's rule and circumstances, which may be useful for understanding the claim. 4. "Balaji Vishwanath" context: This context is informative as it discusses the father of Chimaji Appa and Baji Rao I, and his role in the Maratha Empire. It provides additional background that could be relevant to the claim. 5. "Maratha emperors" context: This context provides a broader history of the Maratha Empire and the role of Peshwas, which might be less directly related to the claim but still provides useful background information. 6. "Balaji Kunjar" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different person and period, focusing on Peshwa Baji Rao II rather than the time of Chimaji Appa. 7. "Rajaram II of Satara" context: This context is also less relevant because it focuses on a later period and a different figurehead, Rajaram II, rather than the claim about Chimaji Appa. 8. "Maynak Bhandari" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses the Maratha Navy and a different historical figure, which is not directly related to the claim about Chimaji Appa's role.
idx: [2, 3, 6, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the role Chimaji Appa served to the fifth Maratha Chhatrapati Shahu. 1. Context idx 2: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Chimaji Appa and describes his military achievements, but it does not specify the role he served to Chhatrapati Shahu. 2. Context idx 3: This context is about Baji Rao I, who served as Peshwa to Chhatrapati Shahu. It is relevant because it mentions the role of Peshwa, which is the answer to the claim, but it is about Baji Rao I, not Chimaji Appa. 3. Context idx 6: This context provides background on Chhatrapati Shahu, which is somewhat relevant but does not mention Chimaji Appa or the role he served. 4. Context idx 5: This context is about Balaji Vishwanath, Chimaji Appa's father, and mentions his roles and services, which could imply the roles his son might have served, making it indirectly relevant.

However, it is closely related to the claim and could lead to finding the answer. 3. "AFL Rising Star" context: This context provides background information about the AFL Rising Star award, which is relevant to the claim but does not contain the specific answer. 4. "Clayton Oliver" context: Although this context is about a different player who was nominated for the Rising Star award, it is less relevant because it does not pertain to the 2015 winner or his height. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim as they do not mention Jesse Hogan or the 2015 AFL Rising Star award.

step-by-step think:1. "Jesse Hogan" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Jesse Hogan, the player who won the 2015 AFL Rising Star award, and provides his height, which directly answers the claim. 2.

idx: [3, 4, 0, 1, 6, 7, 2, 5]

step-by-step think: 1.

It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Fiona Bruce (politician)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides information about Fiona Bruce, the Member of Parliament for Congleton, and specifies that she is a member of the Conservative Party. It is informative and confirms the party affiliation. 3. "Glasgow North East by-election, 2009" context: This context is less relevant as it pertains to a by-election in Glasgow North East and not Congleton. It mentions the political party in a different context, which is less likely to contain the answer to the claim about Congleton. 4. "Jean-Marie Boisvert" context: This context is about a Canadian politician and is not relevant to the claim about the House of Commons representative for Congleton. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 5.

It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 8. "Baron Dunalley" context: This context discusses a title in the Peerage of Ireland and is not relevant to the current political representation of Congleton. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:Season 2 of Rick and Morty began with the episode directed by whom?
golden idx: [5, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the director of the first episode of Season 2 of "Rick and Morty". 1. Context idx 5: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions "A Rickle in Time" as the first episode of Season 2 and names Wes Archer as the director. 2. Context idx 6: This context is relevant as it talks about the second season of "Rick and Morty" and mentions the premiere episode "A Rickle in Time", but does not name the director. 3. Context idx 0: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses an episode from Season 2, but it is not the first episode and therefore less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. Context idx 4: This context is about an episode from Season 1, so it is less relevant. 5. Context idx 2: This context is also about an episode from Season 1, making it less relevant. 6. Context idx 3: This context is about another episode from Season 1, so it is less relevant. 7. Context idx 7: This context is about yet another episode from Season 1, so it is less relevant. 8. Context idx 8: This context is about the pilot episode, which is from Season 1, so it is less relevant. The remaining contexts (idx 1 and 9) are not related to "Rick and Morty" and are therefore not relevant to the claim.
idx: [5, 6, 0, 4, 2, 3, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the director of the first episode of Season 2 of "Rick and Morty". 
1. Context idx 5 ("A Rickle in Time") is the most relevant as it directly mentions that the episode is the first of the second season and names Wes Archer as the director. 
2. Context idx 6 ("Rick and Morty (season 2)") is relevant because it talks about the premiere of the second season with "A Rickle in Time", but it does not mention the director. 
3. Context idx 0 ("The Ricks Must Be Crazy") is less relevant because it is about the sixth episode of the second season and not the first. 
4. Context idx 4 ("Rick Potion No. 9") is not relevant to the claim as it pertains to an episode from a different season.

idx: [5, 6, 0, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "A Rickle in Time" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the specific episode "A Rickle in Time" which is the first episode of the second season of "Rick and Morty" and includes the name of the director, Wes Archer, directly answering the claim. 2. "Rick and Morty (season 2)" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the premiere of the second season with "A Rickle in Time" and provides an overview of the season, but it does not mention the director's name. 3. "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" context: This context is less relevant to the claim as it discusses a different episode from the second season and a different director. 4. "Rick Potion No. 9" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it pertains to an episode from the first season and does not provide information about the second season's premiere or director.

It is highly informative and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Jimmy Bartel" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides information about Jimmy Bartel, including his association with the Geelong Football Club, which is the answer to the claim. 3. "2011 Brownlow Medal" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses the 2011 Brownlow Medal, not the 2007 one. However, it mentions the voting system and other winners, which could provide some background information. 4. "2005 Brownlow Medal" context: This context is informative about the Brownlow Medal but is not directly related to the 2007 medal or Jimmy Bartel. 5. "2006 Brownlow Medal" context: Similar to the 2005 context, it provides general information about the Brownlow Medal but does not directly answer the claim. 6. "2014 Brownlow Medal" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on the 2014 Brownlow Medal and does not mention Jimmy Bartel or the 2007 medal. 7. "2015 Brownlow Medal" context: This context is about the 2015 Brownlow Medal and is not directly related to the claim. 8. "1993 Brownlow Medal" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses the 1993 Brownlow Medal and does not provide information about the 2007 medal or Jimmy Bartel.
idx: [2, 0, 1, 4, 8, 6, 7, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the team of the 2007 Brownlow Medal recipient. 1. Context idx 2: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 2007 Brownlow Medal and states that Jimmy Bartel won the medal, and he played for the Geelong Football Club. 2. Context idx 0: This context is also highly relevant because it provides information about Jimmy Bartel, including the fact that he played for the Geelong Football Club. 3.

Context idx 4: This context discusses the 2005 Brownlow Medal, which is less relevant to the 2007 claim but still provides background on the award. The other contexts are about different years and do not directly answer the claim.

step-by-step think: 1. Context with 'idx': 2 is the most relevant as it directly answers the claim by mentioning Jimmy Bartel and the team he played for during the 2007 AFL season, which is the Geelong Football Club. 2. Context with 'idx': 0 is the second most relevant because it provides detailed information about Jimmy Bartel, including his association with the Geelong Football Club, which is directly related to the claim. 3. Context with 'idx': 1, while it discusses the Brownlow Medal, it pertains to the year 2011 and mentions Dane Swan and the Collingwood Football Club, which are not directly related to the 2007 medal or Jimmy Bartel. 4.

golden idx: [0, 1]
step-by-step think: The claim asks whether both the Battle of Stones River and the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River were fought in the 19th century. To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer.

5. "Collins Ferry Historic District" context: This context is relevant to the extent that it discusses events and locations from the 19th century, which may indirectly support the timeframe of the Battle of Stones River.
6. "Savage's Station, Virginia" context: This context is relevant as it discusses a location and events related to the American Civil War, which occurred in the 19th century, providing additional context to the timeframe of the Battle of Stones River.
7. "Umba River (Tanzania)" context: This context mentions the 19th century but is less relevant because it does not directly relate to the battles in question.
8. "Military history of Mexico" context: This context is the least relevant of the top 8 because it discusses the 19th century in a different geographical area and does not directly relate to the battles in question.

The remaining contexts are not included in the top 8 because they either discuss events outside the 19th century or are less relevant to the claim.

idx: [1, 0, 9, 2, 4, 5, 3, 8]

"Delmer Daves" context: This context provides a direct overview of Delmer Daves' career, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 2.

Question:Which band has more members, Test Icicles or X Ambassadors?
golden idx: [1, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine which band has more members, the contexts that directly mention the band members are most relevant. 1. "X Ambassadors" context: It lists the current members of X Ambassadors, which is directly relevant to the claim. 2. "Test Icicles" context: It mentions the formation and members of Test Icicles, which is necessary to answer the claim. 3.

"Rory Attwell" context: It discusses a member of Test Icicles, contributing to the claim. 5. "For Screening Purposes Only" context: It mentions Test Icicles as a trio, which indirectly suggests the number of members. 6. "Dig Your Own Grave" context: It provides additional information about Test Icicles, which may be useful. 7. "Cannonball (Skylar Grey song)" context: It mentions X Ambassadors in relation to a song, which is less directly relevant. 8. "Jungle (X Ambassadors and Jamie N Commons song)" context: It mentions X Ambassadors, but not in the context of band members.
idx: [7,1,9,3,2,4,0,6]

step-by-step think: To determine which band has more members, I need to find the contexts that provide information about the number of members in each band. 1. "X Ambassadors" context: This context is highly relevant as it lists the members of X Ambassadors, which is directly related to the claim. It mentions four members by name. 2. "Test Icicles" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides information about the formation of Test Icicles and mentions three members by name. 3. "Dev Hynes" context: This context is relevant as it provides additional information about one of the members of Test Icicles, which could be useful in determining the total number of members. 4. "Rory Attwell" context: This context is informative as it talks about Rory Attwell's involvement in Test Icicles, but it does not provide a direct count of the members. 5. "For Screening Purposes Only" context: This context is less relevant because it discusses Test Icicles' album rather than the band's membership. 6.

"Cannonball (Skylar Grey song)" context: This context is relevant to X Ambassadors but does not provide information about the band's members. 8. "Jungle (X Ambassadors and Jamie N Commons song)" context: This context is related to X Ambassadors but, like the previous one, does not detail the band's membership.
idx: [7, 1, 9, 3]

step-by-step think: To determine which band has more members, the contexts need to provide specific information about the number of members in each band. 1. "X Ambassadors" context: This context is highly relevant as it lists the members of X Ambassadors, which directly addresses the claim. It mentions four members by name and their roles in the band. 2. "Test Icicles" context: This context is also relevant because it provides information about the formation of Test Icicles and mentions three members by name. However, it does not specify if these were the only members, which makes it slightly less informative than the X Ambassadors context. 3. "Dev Hynes" context: This context is relevant as it discusses a member of Test Icicles, Dev Hynes, and his role in the band. It is informative but less directly related to the claim than the previous two contexts. 4. "Rory Attwell" context: This context is informative about Rory Attwell's involvement in Test Icicles, but like the Dev Hynes context, it is less directly related to the claim compared to the contexts that list the band members.

Question:How long is the river for which Frenchmans Creek is a tributary?
golden idx: [5, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine the length of the river for which Frenchmans Creek is a tributary, we need to find the context that discusses the main river into which Frenchmans Creek flows. 1. "Frenchmans Creek (California)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Frenchmans Creek directly and provides information about its length and its largest tributary. However, it does not mention the main river it flows into. 2. "Locks Creek" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Locks Creek as the largest tributary of Frenchmans Creek. It is informative but does not mention the main river. 3. "Frenchmans Creek (New South Wales)" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Frenchmans Creek and its confluence with the Darling River, providing the length of Frenchmans Creek. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim since it connects Frenchmans Creek to the Darling River. 4. "Darling River" context: This context is extremely relevant as it provides the length of the Darling River, which is the river for which Frenchmans Creek is a tributary. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not mention Frenchmans Creek or the Darling River. They provide information about other rivers and their tributaries, which are not directly related to the claim.
idx: [7, 5, 0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Frenchmans Creek (New South Wales)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Frenchmans Creek and provides specific information about its length, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Darling River" context: This context is relevant because it describes the Darling River, of which Frenchmans Creek is a tributary. It provides information about the length of the Darling River, which is useful for understanding the significance of Frenchmans Creek as a tributary. 3. "Frenchmans Creek (California)" context: This context is less relevant because it refers to a different Frenchmans Creek located in California. However, it is informative and mentions the length of this particular creek. 4. "Locks Creek" context: This context is related to the less relevant Frenchmans Creek in California and provides information about its tributary, Locks Creek. It is the least relevant among the top four because it is another step removed from the original claim.
idx: [7, 5, 0, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Frenchmans Creek (New South Wales)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Frenchmans Creek in New South Wales and provides specific measurements of its length, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Darling River" context: This context is relevant because it describes the Darling River, for which Frenchmans Creek is a tributary. It provides the length of the Darling River, which is useful but not the direct answer to the claim. 3. "Frenchmans Creek (California)" context: This context is less relevant because it refers to a different Frenchmans Creek located in California. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim about the river in New South Wales. 4. "Locks Creek" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses Locks Creek, a tributary of the Frenchmans Creek in California, and does not provide information about the river in New South Wales.

It is less relevant and less likely to contain the answer. 8. "Middlebourne Historic District" context: This context discusses a historic district in Tyler County, West Virginia, and mentions several buildings, including a high school. However, it is not directly related to Tyler Kalinoski and is less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [5,9,0,1,4,6,7,8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Olathe East High School" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the school Tyler Kalinoski attended, providing its location in Olathe, Kansas. It is the most informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Tyler Kalinoski" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Tyler Kalinoski and his high school, but it does not directly answer the location question. However, it is closely related and provides background information that supports the claim. 3. "Tyler Consolidated High School" context: While this context mentions a high school and provides a location, it is not the school in question and is therefore less relevant. 4. "Woodville High School (Texas)" context: This context is similar to the previous one in that it mentions a high school and its location, but again, it is not the school Tyler Kalinoski attended, making it less relevant.

"Olathe East High School" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides detailed information about Olathe East High School, including its location in Olathe, Kansas, which is the answer to the claim. 3. "Tyler Consolidated High School" context: While this context mentions a high school with 'Tyler' in its name, it is not relevant to the claim as it is a different school located in West Virginia. 4. "Woodville High School (Texas)" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a high school in Texas, which has no apparent connection to Tyler Kalinoski or the claim.

golden idx: [0, 8]
# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the context that directly mentions Ambrose Mendy and the ranking of a British professional boxer by a specific entity as of July 2017. Context 0 is the most relevant as it mentions Ambrose Mendy and the boxers he has managed or advised. Context 8 is the second most relevant because it mentions Chris Eubank Jr., a boxer managed by Mendy, and includes his ranking as of July 2017 by BoxRec, Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, and "The Ring" magazine. The other contexts mention various boxers and titles but do not directly relate to the claim's specifics about the ranking entity or the date. Therefore, they are ranked based on the mention of British boxers and their relevance to super middleweight rankings.
# idx: [0, 8, 3, 7, 6, 4, 1, 2]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer. The claim is about a British professional boxer managed or advised by Ambrose Mendy, ranked as the world's seventh best super middleweight by a specific entity as of July 2017.

1. Context idx 8 ("Chris Eubank Jr."): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Chris Eubank Jr., a boxer managed by Ambrose Mendy, and states that he is ranked seventh by "The Ring" magazine as of July 2017, directly answering the claim.
2. Context idx 0 ("Ambrose Mendy"): This context is relevant because it mentions Ambrose Mendy and lists the boxers he has managed or advised, which includes Chris Eubank Jr. However, it does not provide the specific ranking information.
3. Context idx 2 ("Natascha Ragosina"): Although this context is about a boxer and provides information on rankings, it is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention the boxer in question or the specific ranking by "The Ring" magazine.
4. Context idx 3 ("Luke Blackledge"): This context is about a different boxer and does not mention the ranking by "The Ring" magazine, making it less relevant to the claim.

The remaining contexts are not directly relevant to the claim as they do not mention the boxer in question or the specific ranking by "The Ring" magazine.

idx: [8, 0, 2, 3]

step-by-step think:1. "Chris Eubank Jr." context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Chris Eubank Jr., a boxer managed by Ambrose Mendy, and provides his ranking as of July 2017, which is the specific information the claim is asking for. 2. "Ambrose Mendy" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Ambrose Mendy and lists the boxers he has managed or advised, including Chris Eubank Jr. However, it does not provide the specific ranking information. 3. "Luke Blackledge" context: This context is less relevant as it does not mention the ranking or the connection to Ambrose Mendy, but it is about a super middleweight boxer, which is related to the claim's focus on boxing rankings. 4. "Natascha Ragosina" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention Ambrose Mendy or any male super middleweight boxers, and it focuses on a retired female boxer's career and titles.

Context 8 mentions Elizabeth Neilson, a figure in health education, and includes a birth year, making it somewhat relevant. Contexts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 mention holistic health but do not provide information about Rejuvelac or its inventor's birth year, making them less relevant.
# idx: [0,9,1,8,2,3,4,5]

"Rejuvelac" context: This context is relevant because it confirms that Ann Wigmore invented and promoted Rejuvelac, but it does not provide her birth year. 3. "Viktoras Kulvinskas" context: This context is less relevant because, although it mentions a holistic health practitioner, it does not pertain to the invention of Rejuvelac or Ann Wigmore. 4.

"Ann Wigmore" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Ann Wigmore, the inventor of Rejuvelac, and provides her birth and death years, directly answering the claim. 2. "Rejuvelac" context: This context is relevant because it confirms that Ann Wigmore invented Rejuvelac, but it does not provide her birth year. 3. "Viktoras Kulvinskas" context: This context is less relevant to the claim as it discusses another individual who is a holistic health practitioner but has no direct connection to the invention of Rejuvelac. 4. "Elizabeth Neilson" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a different health educator who is not connected to Rejuvelac or Ann Wigmore.

Question:What star of "Attack of the Gryphon" was also a voice artist in Johnny Bravo?  
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about a star from "Attack of the Gryphon" who was also a voice artist in "Johnny Bravo". Context 3 mentions Larry Drake, who is associated with both "Johnny Bravo" and "Attack of the Gryphon", making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 9 mentions Jeff Bennett as a voice actor in "Johnny Bravo" but does not link him to "Attack of the Gryphon", so it is relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. Context 7 is about Van Partible, the creator of "Johnny Bravo", and while informative, it does not address the claim directly. Context 0 provides a general overview of "Johnny Bravo" and is informative but not directly related to the claim. Context 4 mentions Rumen Petkov, who worked on "Johnny Bravo", but does not link him to "Attack of the Gryphon". Context 6 mentions Brian A. Miller, associated with "Johnny Bravo", but again, not linked to "Attack of the Gryphon". Context 8 discusses Sherry Gunther's work on "Johnny Bravo" but does not mention "Attack of the Gryphon". Context 2 is about Larry Drake, already covered in context 3, which is more informative. Context 1 and context 5 are not relevant to the claim.
idx: [3,9,7,0,4,6,8,2]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim and the likelihood that they contain the answer. 1. Context from 'Jeff Bennett': This context directly mentions Jeff Bennett as a voice actor for Johnny Bravo, which is highly relevant to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer since it connects both "Attack of the Gryphon" and "Johnny Bravo". 2. Context from 'Larry Drake': This context mentions Larry Drake as a voice artist in "Johnny Bravo", making it relevant. However, it does not connect him to "Attack of the Gryphon", so it's less likely to contain the answer than the context from 'Jeff Bennett'. 3. Context from 'Gryphon (film)': This context is relevant as it mentions the film "Attack of the Gryphon", but does not mention any connection to "Johnny Bravo". 4. Context from 'Rumen Petkov': This context mentions work on "Johnny Bravo", making it somewhat relevant, but it does not mention "Attack of the Gryphon". The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention both the film and the show.
idx: [9, 2, 3, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Jeff Bennett" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Jeff Bennett's role as Johnny Bravo, directly linking to the claim. It is informative and very likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Larry Drake" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Larry Drake's involvement in "Johnny Bravo" as the voice of Pops, and his role in "Attack of the Gryphon," making it likely to contain the answer. 3. "Gryphon (film)" context: This context is relevant as it provides information about the film "Attack of the Gryphon," which is part of the claim. However, it does not mention voice acting roles, making it slightly less likely to contain the answer compared to the first two contexts. 4. "Rumen Petkov" context: This context mentions Rumen Petkov's work on "Johnny Bravo," but does not link him directly to "Attack of the Gryphon," making it less relevant to the claim.

Context idx 1: "The Golden Voyage of Sinbad" is a fantasy film from the 1970s, but it does not mention the song in question, making it less relevant. 4. Context idx 3: This context mentions a fantasy film "Hugo" and a Disney Channel series, which might confuse the relevance, but it does not contain the answer to the claim. 5. Context idx 4: "Once Upon a Time in Vietnam" is a fantasy film, but from 2013, and does not relate to the claim. 6. Context idx 6: "Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children" is a fantasy film but from 2005 and unrelated to the claim. 7.

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the song "The Age of Not Believing" and the film "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" where it was featured. It provides detailed information about the song, its significance in the film, and the film's themes. 2.

It includes details about the film's release and its stars. 3. Context idx 1: While this context is about a fantasy film from the early 1970s, it is not the film that featured the song "The Age of Not Believing." However, it is still relevant to the broader topic of fantasy films from that era. 4. Context idx 2: This context is about a short film and includes information about awards and festivals. It is less relevant than the others but is included because it pertains to the fantasy film genre.
idx: [5, 0, 1, 2]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with 'idx': 5 is the most relevant as it directly mentions the song "The Age of Not Believing" and the film "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" where it was featured. It provides detailed information about the song's role in the film and its thematic significance. 2. Context with 'idx': 0 is the second most relevant because it talks about the film "Bedknobs and Broomsticks," which is the film in question. It provides information about the film's release and its stars, which is useful but less directly related to the song itself compared to the first context. 3. Context with 'idx': 1, "The Golden Voyage of Sinbad," is a fantasy film from the early 1970s, which makes it somewhat relevant. However, it does not mention the song or indicate that it was featured in this film, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. The context with 'idx': 2 is not relevant as it discusses a film from 2014, which is outside the scope of the claim.

"Whitney Dean" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses Whitney's relationship with the Carter family and her engagement to Woody Woodward, but it does not provide the address. 6. "Square and Compass, Worth Matravers" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different public house and does not mention Mick Carter or the address in question. 7. "Fat Cat Brewery" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a brewery and its owner, not the public house where Mick Carter is the landlord. 8. "The Gatehouse, Monmouth" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different public house located in Monmouth, Wales. 9. "Shakespeare Public House, Bristol" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a historic public house in Bristol, England. 10. "Adam & Eve, Birmingham" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a former public house in Birmingham, England.
idx: [3, 6, 8, 0, 9, 1, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about Mick Carter being the landlord of a public house and the likelihood of them containing the address of the property. 1. Context idx 6: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Mick Carter becoming the landlord of The Queen Victoria, which is the public house in question. It is likely to contain the address since it discusses his role in detail. 2. Context idx 3: This context is directly relevant as it mentions The Queen Victoria and provides its fictional address, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 8: This context is relevant because it discusses Linda Carter, who is associated with Mick Carter and The Queen Victoria. It may contain the address or additional details about the public house. 4. Context idx 0: This context is less directly related but still relevant as it discusses Nancy Carter, the daughter of Mick Carter, and her connection to The Queen Victoria. It is less likely than the previous contexts to contain the address but still pertinent to the claim.
idx: [6,3,8,0]

step-by-step think:1. "The Queen Victoria" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the specific address of The Queen Victoria, which is the public house Mick Carter is the landlord of. It directly answers the claim. 2. "Mick Carter" context: This context mentions Mick Carter becoming the landlord of The Queen Victoria and is relevant to the claim. However, it does not provide the specific address. 3. "Linda Carter" context: This context is relevant as it discusses Linda Carter's role as landlady and her move to The Queen Victoria with her family. It is informative and indirectly supports the claim by association with Mick Carter. 4. "Nancy Carter" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on Nancy Carter's storylines and does not mention the address of The Queen Victoria or her father's role as the landlord.

Question:What television thriller anthology did the winner of one Golden Globe, two tony Awards and six Primetime Emmy Awards appear on?
golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider the relevance to the claim, the informativeness, and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim asks for a television thriller anthology series that featured an actor who won one Golden Globe, two Tony Awards, and six Primetime Emmy Awards. 

1. Context 6 ("Brian Dennehy"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Brian Dennehy, an actor who fits the award-winning criteria mentioned in the claim and appeared in "Darkroom," a thriller anthology series.
2. Context 0 ("Darkroom (TV series)"): This context is directly related to the claim as it describes the "Darkroom" TV series and lists Brian Dennehy as one of the performers.
3. Context 3 ("John Lithgow"): John Lithgow has won two Tony Awards and six Emmy Awards, which makes this context relevant, but it does not mention his appearance on a thriller anthology series.
4. Context 1 ("Al Pacino"): Al Pacino has won two Tony Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards, but the context does not mention a thriller anthology series.
5. Context 4 ("Al Pacino on stage and screen"): Similar to context 1, it mentions Al Pacino's awards but lacks information about a thriller anthology series.
6. Context 7 ("Laura Linney"): Laura Linney has won four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards, but the context does not mention her appearing in a thriller anthology series.
7. Context 8 ("Elisabeth Moss"): Elisabeth Moss has won a Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy Awards, but again, there is no mention of a thriller anthology series.
8. Context 9 ("Blythe Danner"): Blythe Danner fits some of the award criteria but does not match the specific awards count from the claim, and there is no mention of a thriller anthology series.

The remaining contexts are not as relevant because they either do not mention the specific awards or the thriller anthology series, making them less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

Since Brian Dennehy fits the description of the awards won as mentioned in the claim, this context is likely to contain the answer. 2. "Brian Dennehy" context: This context is about Brian Dennehy, who has won the awards mentioned in the claim. It is relevant because it provides background information on his career, including his roles in television, which may lead to the anthology series in question. 3. "Blythe Danner" context: This context mentions Blythe Danner, who has won two Primetime Emmy Awards and a Tony Award. It is somewhat relevant but does not mention a thriller anthology series, making it less likely to contain the answer. 4.

Question:What is the name of the film starring Rose McGowan and features the character Earl McGraw's daughter?
golden idx: [4, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about a film starring Rose McGowan and featuring Earl McGraw's daughter. The most relevant context will be the one that mentions both Rose McGowan and the character Earl McGraw or his daughter. 

1. Context idx 4 ("Planet Terror"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Rose McGowan as a star and is part of the "Grindhouse" project, which includes Earl McGraw's daughter as a character.
2. Context idx 5 ("Earl and Edgar McGraw"): This context is directly relevant as it discusses Earl McGraw and his family, including his daughter Dakota, who appears in "Planet Terror".
3. Context idx 0 ("The Pastor's Wife (film)"): This context mentions Rose McGowan as the star of the film but does not mention Earl McGraw or his daughter.
4. Context idx 1 ("The Doom Generation"): This context mentions Rose McGowan but does not relate to Earl McGraw or his daughter.
5. Context idx 2 ("Devil in the Flesh (1998 film)"): This context mentions Rose McGowan but does not relate to Earl McGraw or his daughter.

The remaining contexts do not mention Rose McGowan or Earl McGraw and are therefore not relevant to the claim.
idx: [4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about a film starring Rose McGowan and featuring Earl McGraw's daughter. 1. "Planet Terror" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Rose McGowan as a star and includes information about Earl McGraw's daughter, Dakota, who plays a large role in the film. 2. "Earl and Edgar McGraw" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the characters Earl and Edgar McGraw and mentions that Earl has a daughter named Dakota, who appears in the "Grindhouse" films, linking her to "Planet Terror". 3. "Scream (1996 film)" context: While this context mentions Rose McGowan, it does not provide information about Earl McGraw's daughter, making it less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. "The Doom Generation" context: This context mentions Rose McGowan as one of the stars but does not mention Earl McGraw's daughter, making it relevant but not as much as the contexts that mention both. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they either mention Rose McGowan without any connection to Earl McGraw's daughter or do not mention her at all.
idx: [4, 5, 9, 1]

step-by-step think:1. "Planet Terror" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the film "Planet Terror" which stars Rose McGowan and includes the character Dakota, Earl McGraw's daughter. It provides detailed information about the film and its characters, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Earl and Edgar McGraw" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the characters Earl and Edgar McGraw, and mentions that Earl has a daughter named Dakota who appears in the "Grindhouse" films, specifically "Planet Terror". It is informative and directly connected to the claim. 3. "The Doom Generation" context: While this context mentions Rose McGowan, it does not provide information about Earl McGraw's daughter, making it less relevant than the first two contexts. However, it is still more relevant than the "Scream" context because it does not relate to the claim at all.

"Guapas" context: This context mentions Isabel Macedo as a star in another telenovela, but the dates and the character name do not match the claim. 4. "Amar después de amar" context: This context includes Isabel Macedo in a leading role, but again, the dates and character name are not relevant to the claim.
idx: [7, 3, 1, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. "Patricia Longo" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Jimena Benítez, the character played by Isabel Macedo in the telenovela "Graduados," which matches the time frame given in the claim. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Graduados" context: This context is relevant because it describes the telenovela "Graduados," which was broadcast within the specified dates and is the show in which the character Jimena Benítez appears. However, it does not mention Jimena Benítez or Isabel Macedo directly in the provided text, making it slightly less relevant than the "Patricia Longo" context. 3. "Guapas" context: This context mentions Isabel Macedo as a star in another telenovela, which is not the one in question but indicates her involvement in the industry during the relevant time period. It is less relevant than the first two contexts but more so than the "Amar después de amar" context, which is from a different time period. 4. "Amar después de amar" context: This context is the least relevant as it pertains to a different telenovela that aired after the specified dates and does not mention the character Jimena Benítez.

"Hannibal Brooks" context: This context is less relevant as it is about a war comedy film, not a documentary, and does not relate to the claim. 5. "Khan Kluay" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about an animated film, not a documentary, and does not mention war. 6.

idx: [3, 6, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "To Shoot an Elephant" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to the claim, mentioning the documentary "To Shoot an Elephant" and providing information about its focus on the Gaza War, which is a war-related topic. 2. "Agee (film)" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions "Agee," which is part of the claim. It provides information about the documentary and its focus on the writer James Agee, but it does not explicitly mention war, making it slightly less relevant than the first context. 3.

However, it does not directly relate to the claim about the two specific documentaries mentioned. 4.

golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for a specific shallow water table aquifer near the county seat of Keith County, Nebraska.

Context idx 6: This context directly mentions the "Ogallala Aquifer," which is a shallow water table aquifer and is named after the town of Ogallala, the county seat of Keith County. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: This context talks about Ogallala, Nebraska, and mentions that the Ogallala Aquifer was named after the city. It is relevant and supports the information provided in context idx 6. 3. Context idx 4: This context provides information about Keith County, Nebraska, and identifies Ogallala as the county seat, which is relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 0: This context mentions Keystone, Nebraska, which is near Ogallala, providing some geographical relevance. 5. Context idx 9: This context talks about Lemoyne, Nebraska, which is in Keith County and mentions its proximity to Ogallala. 6. Context idx 8: Kingsley Dam is mentioned, which is in Keith County and related to water management, but less directly related to the claim. 7. Context idx 3: This context mentions a water table in relation to a farm, but it is in Maryland, not Nebraska. 8. Context idx 5: This context discusses Flatwood soils with a shallow water table, but it is not specific to Keith County or Nebraska.
idx: [6, 7, 4, 0, 9, 8, 3, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "Ogallala Aquifer" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Ogallala Aquifer, which is a shallow water table aquifer and specifies its location in relation to Ogallala, Nebraska. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Ogallala, Nebraska" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it mentions Ogallala, the county seat of Keith County, and the naming of the Ogallala Aquifer after the city. It provides geographical and historical information that is pertinent to the claim. 3. "Keith County, Nebraska" context: This context is relevant because it mentions that Ogallala is the county seat of Keith County, which is necessary information for the claim. However, it does not mention the aquifer directly. 4. "Kingsley Dam" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions the location of Kingsley Dam in relation to Lake Ogallala and Keith County. It provides some geographical context that could be useful for the claim. 5. "Keystone, Nebraska" context: This context is less relevant as it only provides information about Keystone's location in relation to Ogallala and does not mention the aquifer. 6. "Lemoyne, Nebraska" context: This context is also less relevant as it only mentions Lemoyne's location in relation to Ogallala and does not provide information about the aquifer. 7. "Ingram–Schipper Farm" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a location in Maryland, which is not related to the aquifer or Keith County, Nebraska. 8. "Flatwood" context: This context is not directly relevant to the claim as it discusses a soil series in the southeastern United States and not the specific aquifer in question.
idx: [6, 7, 4, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Ogallala Aquifer" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Ogallala Aquifer, which is a shallow water table aquifer, and provides extensive information about its location and characteristics. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim since it specifies that the aquifer is located beneath the Great Plains, which includes Nebraska. 2. "Ogallala, Nebraska" context: This context is directly relevant because it mentions Ogallala, which is the county seat of Keith County, and also refers to the Ogallala Aquifer. It provides demographic information about the city and its historical significance, which is informative. 3. "Keith County, Nebraska" context: This context is relevant as it provides information about Keith County, including its population and the fact that its county seat is Ogallala.

step-by-step think:1. "Ibn Arabi" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth and death dates of Ibn Arabi, which is crucial for determining who was born first. 2. "Mahbub ul Haq" context: This context is equally important because it gives the specific birth and death dates of Mahbub ul Haq, allowing for a direct comparison with Ibn Arabi's dates. 3. "Akbariyya" context: While this context is about the philosophical branch influenced by Ibn Arabi, it also mentions his birth and death years, which are pertinent to the claim. 4. "Human Development Index" context: This context mentions Mahbub ul Haq in relation to the development of the HDI, which is less directly related to the claim but still provides information on one of the individuals in question.
idx: [6, 4, 3, 9]

Question:What does the goddess associated with the goddess frigg  consists of what tales?
golden idx: [2, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the goddess Frigg and the likelihood of containing tales associated with her. 1. "Fensalir" context: Directly related to Frigg's dwelling place and may contain tales about her. 2. "Fulla" context: Mentions Fulla's close relationship with Frigg and her role, likely to contain relevant tales. 3. "Hlín" context: Hlín is associated with Frigg and may share tales involving both. 4. "Eir" context: Eir is theorized as a form of Frigg, potentially relevant tales. 5. "Nanna (Norse deity)" context: Involves Frigg indirectly through Nanna's gifts to her. 6. "Sága and Sökkvabekkr" context: Sága's connection to Frigg could mean shared tales. 7. "Gná and Hófvarpnir" context: Gná serves Frigg, possible tales of errands for her. 8. "Norse mythology" context: General mythology context, less specific but still relevant.
idx: [1, 3, 7, 8, 0, 4, 5, 2]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the goddess Frigg and the tales associated with her. 1. "Fensalir" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the location where the goddess Frigg dwells and is directly related to Norse mythology, making it likely to contain tales about Frigg. 2. "Fulla" context: This context is also relevant because it describes Fulla, a goddess closely associated with Frigg, and mentions their relationship, which could lead to tales involving Frigg. 3. "Hlín" context: This context is pertinent as it discusses Hlín, another goddess associated with Frigg, and the possibility of Hlín being another name for Frigg, indicating a close connection that may include tales about Frigg. 4. "Eir" context: This context is relevant as it explores the connection between Eir, a goddess or valkyrie, and Frigg, and discusses the scholarly debate about Eir's identity, which may include tales about Frigg. The remaining contexts are less directly related to Frigg and her tales, hence they are ranked lower.
idx: [1, 3, 7, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Fensalir" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to the goddess Frigg, mentioning the location where she dwells and is attested in both the "Poetic Edda" and the "Prose Edda". It is informative and likely contains tales associated with Frigg. 2. "Fulla" context: This context is also relevant because it describes Fulla, a goddess closely associated with Frigg, mentioning her role and connection to Frigg's secrets. It is likely to contain tales related to Frigg as it discusses her confidante. 3. "Hlín" context: This context mentions Hlín as a goddess associated with Frigg and includes references to the "Poetic Edda" and the "Prose Edda". It suggests that Hlín might be another name for Frigg, indicating a strong relevance to the claim. 4. "Eir" context: Although this context mentions Eir's association with Frigg, it focuses more on her role as a healer or valkyrie, which might be less directly related to tales of Frigg compared to the other contexts.

golden idx: [7, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim, the informativeness, and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim asks for the position held by the lord under whom William Pery served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1865 to 1868. 

1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Henry Cadogan, who served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard between 1866 and 1868, which aligns with the claim's timeframe.
2. Context idx 9: This context is also directly relevant because it mentions William Pery serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under Lord Salisbury, which is likely the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 7: This context is about Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who was styled Viscount Cranborne from June 1865 until April 1868, making it potentially relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 3: This context mentions William Monson serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under William Ewart Gladstone, but the years mentioned do not match the claim's timeframe.
5. Context idx 4: This context is less relevant as it mentions George Percy serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under Sir Robert Peel, which is outside the claim's timeframe.
6. Context idx 0: This context is about Henry Fox-Strangways, who served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under Lord Melbourne, which is not within the claim's timeframe.
7. Context idx 6: This context is about the Earl of Aylesford, who served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1783 to 1804, which is well before the claim's timeframe.
8. Context idx 2: This context is about the Baron Berkeley of Stratton, who held office as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, but the timeframe is not specified.
9. Context idx 5: This context provides general information about the Yeomen of the Guard but does not mention specific individuals or timeframes related to the claim.
10. Context idx 8: This context is about William Street, named after William Pery, but does not provide information relevant to the claim.

Based on the above considerations, the top 8 ranked contexts based on their scores are:
idx: [1, 9, 7, 3, 4, 0, 6, 2]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Henry Cadogan serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard during the exact period in question, 1866 to 1868. 2. Context idx 9: This context is relevant because it mentions William Pery serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, but under Lord Salisbury, which is outside the period in question. 3. Context idx 7: This context is relevant as it mentions Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, who was Viscount Cranborne during the period in question and later became Prime Minister. 4. Context idx 3: This context is less relevant as it mentions William Monson serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, but the period (1880-1886) does not match the claim. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they either mention individuals serving in different periods or roles unrelated to the claim.
idx: [1, 9, 7, 3]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking under which lord William Pery served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, specifically during the period from 1865 to 1868. 
1. Context from idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Henry Cadogan serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard between 1866 and 1868, which overlaps with the time period in question. However, it does not mention William Pery or the lord he served under.
2. Context from idx 9: This context mentions William Pery serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under Lord Salisbury, but the time period (1889 to 1892 and 1895 to 1896) does not match the claim's specified years.
3. Context from idx 7: This context is about Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who was styled Viscount Cranborne from June 1865 until April 1868. This is directly relevant because it covers the exact time period in question and mentions a title that could be the answer to the claim.
4. Context from idx 3: This context is about William Monson serving as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under William Ewart Gladstone, but the years mentioned (1880 to 1885 and 1886) do not match the claim's specified years.

Based on the relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer, the contexts should be ranked as follows:
- The context from idx 7 is the most relevant and likely to contain the answer.
- The context from idx 1 is relevant but less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim.
- The context from idx 9 is relevant to William Pery but does not match the specified years.
- The context from idx 3 is the least relevant as it does not match the specified years and does not mention the lord in question.

It is informative and very likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

It is informative about elephants but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim compared to the context that directly mentions 'Gajabrishta'.

Question:Kam Heskin plays Paige Morgan in a 2004 film directed by who?
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: The claim is about Kam Heskin playing Paige Morgan in a 2004 film and the director of that film. 1. "The Prince and Me" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the film from 2004, which focuses on Paige Morgan, the character played by Kam Heskin. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Kam Heskin" context: This context is directly about Kam Heskin and mentions her role as Paige Morgan in "The Prince and Me" film franchise, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 3. "The Prince & Me 2: The Royal Wedding" context: Although this context is about the sequel to the 2004 film, it mentions Kam Heskin replacing Julia Stiles as Paige Morgan, which is relevant to the claim. 4. "Pride & Prejudice: A Latter-Day Comedy" context: This context mentions Kam Heskin's performance as Elizabeth, which is not directly related to the claim but is informative about her acting career. 5. "True True Lie" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions a different film and character named Paige, but not the one played by Kam Heskin. 6. "Turning Paige" context: This context is also less relevant because it focuses on a different Paige and does not involve Kam Heskin. 7. "Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film and director. 8. "R-Point" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about a different film and does not mention Kam Heskin or Paige Morgan. 9. "Sunset at Chaophraya (2013 film)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about a different film and does not mention Kam Heskin or Paige Morgan. 10. "Sunset at Chaophraya (1996 film)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about a different film and does not mention Kam Heskin or Paige Morgan.
idx: [2, 3, 6, 8, 1, 5, 0, 4]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the director of a 2004 film in which Kam Heskin played Paige Morgan. 1. Context 2 is the most relevant as it mentions "The Prince and Me" as a 2004 film, which focuses on Paige Morgan, and states that it was directed by Martha Coolidge. This context directly answers the claim. 2. Context 3, while it mentions Kam Heskin playing Paige Morgan in "The Prince and Me" film franchise, it refers to the sequel released in 2006 and directed by Catherine Cyran, which does not answer the claim about the 2004 film. 3. Context 6 mentions "The Prince and Me 2: The Royal Wedding," which is a sequel to the 2004 film and does not provide information about the director of the original film. 4. Context 8 is about "Pride & Prejudice: A Latter-Day Comedy," a film in which Kam Heskin played Elizabeth, not Paige Morgan, and it was released in 2003, not 2004. It is less relevant as it does not answer the claim but is included because it mentions Kam Heskin's filmography. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the 2004 film or the character Paige Morgan played by Kam Heskin.
idx: [2, 3, 6, 8]

step-by-step think: The claim is about Kam Heskin playing Paige Morgan in a 2004 film and who directed it. 1. Context 2 is the most relevant as it mentions "The Prince and Me" as a 2004 film, which focuses on Paige Morgan, and states that Martha Coolidge directed it. 2. Context 3, while it mentions Kam Heskin playing Paige Morgan, refers to the sequel of the 2004 film, which was released in 2006 and directed by Catherine Cyran, thus it's less relevant to the claim. 3. Context 8 is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different film and does not mention the director of "The Prince and Me". 4. Context 6 is relevant as it mentions Kam Heskin and her role as Paige Morgan in "The Prince and Me" film franchise, but it does not specify the director of the 2004 film.

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for an American cable news and talk radio host who was a former GOP representative. 1. "Joe Scarborough" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Joe Scarborough's role as a cable news and talk radio host and his history as a GOP representative, directly answering the claim. 2. "Morning Joe" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the show "Morning Joe," hosted by Joe Scarborough, and mentions his background as a GOP representative. 3. "Sean Hannity" context: While Sean Hannity is a well-known talk show host and political commentator, he was not a GOP representative, making this context less relevant to the claim. 4. "Steve Malzberg" context: Similar to Hannity, Steve Malzberg is a talk show host but does not fit the claim of being a former GOP representative. The remaining contexts are not relevant as they do not pertain to individuals who are both talk show hosts and former GOP representatives.
idx: [1, 3, 7, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Joe Scarborough" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Joe Scarborough and provides comprehensive information about his career as a cable news and talk radio host, including his tenure as a GOP representative. It is informative and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Morning Joe" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the show "Morning Joe," which is hosted by Joe Scarborough, the subject of the claim. It also mentions his role as a former GOP representative, making it likely to contain the answer. 3. "Sean Hannity" context: While this context mentions Sean Hannity as a talk show host and political commentator, it does not indicate any history as a GOP representative, making it less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. "Steve Malzberg" context: This context is about Steve Malzberg, who is also a television and radio host. However, there is no mention of him being a former GOP representative, which makes it the least relevant to the claim.

Question:What Division was the college footbal team that fired their head coach on November 24, 2006?
golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim about a college football team firing their head coach on November 24, 2006. The context must be directly related to college football and the specific date mentioned in the claim to score highly.

1. Context idx 7 ("Larry Coker"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Larry Coker, a college football coach, being fired on the exact date in question, November 24, 2006. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 4 ("2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team"): This context is relevant as it discusses the Alabama Crimson Tide football team and the firing of their head coach, Mike Shula, in 2006. However, it does not specify the date, so it is slightly less relevant than idx 7.
3. Context idx 6 ("2006 Miami Hurricanes football team"): This context is relevant because it pertains to the Miami Hurricanes football team in 2006, but it does not mention the firing of the head coach or the specific date, making it less relevant than idx 7 and idx 4.
4. Context idx 3 ("2009 Virginia Cavaliers football team"): This context is less relevant as it discusses events in 2009 and does not mention the specific date of November 24, 2006.
5. Context idx 2 ("Brian Knorr"): This context is about a college football coach but mentions a firing date in 2004, which is not relevant to the claim.
6. Context idx 1 ("Buzz Peterson"): This context is about a college basketball coach and is not relevant to the claim about college football.
7. Context idx 0 ("Reggie Witherspoon (basketball)"): Similar to idx 1, this context is about a college basketball coach and is not relevant to the claim.
8. Context idx 5 ("Maggie Dixon Award"): This context is about a women's college basketball coach award and is not relevant to the claim.
9. Context idx 9 ("Holly Bruder"): This context is about a college softball coach and is not relevant to the claim.
10. Context idx 8 ("Richard Jacob"): This context is about a sports coach and educator but does not mention college football or the specific date, making it the least relevant.

Based on the above evaluation, the top 8 ranked contexts are:
idx: [7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1, 0, 5]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the college football team that fired their head coach on November 24, 2006. 1. "Larry Coker" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Larry Coker being fired from the University of Miami on the exact date in question. It provides detailed information about his tenure and the circumstances of his firing. 2. "2006 Miami Hurricanes football team" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it discusses the team Larry Coker coached during the 2006 season. 3. "2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team" context: This context is relevant because it discusses a head coach being fired in 2006, but the date and the team do not match the claim. 4. "2009 Virginia Cavaliers football team" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses events from 2009 and a different team, but it is still about college football and coaching changes. The remaining contexts are about individuals or awards not directly related to the claim.
idx: [7, 6, 4, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. "Larry Coker" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Larry Coker, who was the head coach fired on November 24, 2006, and provides detailed information about his tenure and the circumstances of his firing. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "2006 Miami Hurricanes football team" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it specifies the team Larry Coker coached in 2006, which is the University of Miami, and it is the same year mentioned in the claim. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different team and a different head coach being fired in the same year. It is informative but less likely to contain the answer to the claim about the University of Miami's football team. 4. "2009 Virginia Cavaliers football team" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses events from 2009 and a different team, which does not align with the claim about the 2006 season.

golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim asks which of the two magazines, Hänt Extra or Tea Moderna, is a Macedonian weekly. To rank the contexts, I will look for direct mentions of the magazines and information that indicates their country of publication and frequency.
1. "Tea Moderna (magazine)" context: This context directly answers the claim by mentioning that Tea Moderna is a Macedonian woman's weekly magazine. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. "Hänt Extra" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Hänt Extra, but it indicates that the magazine is published in Swedish, suggesting it is not Macedonian.
3. "Makedonsko Sonce" context: While this context is about a Macedonian weekly, it does not answer the claim directly but is relevant due to the mention of a Macedonian weekly magazine.
4. "Hänt Bild" context: This context is related to Hänt Extra and provides additional information about a celebrity magazine published in Sweden, which might be useful for understanding the publisher's profile.
5. "Nikola Mladenov" context: This context mentions a Macedonian journalist and a weekly newspaper, which could be informative regarding Macedonian publications but is less directly related to the claim.
6. "Football Weekly" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a podcast about football and not a magazine.
7. "Henrik Dorsin" context: This context is about a Swedish actor and comedian and is not relevant to the claim about Macedonian weeklies.

idx: [5, 3, 2, 4, 8, 0, 1, 6]

step-by-step think: The claim asks which magazine is a Macedonian weekly between Hänt Extra and Tea Moderna. 1. "Tea Moderna (magazine)" context: This context is directly relevant as it confirms that Tea Moderna is a Macedonian woman's weekly magazine. It is highly informative and directly answers the claim. 2. "Hänt Extra" context: This context is relevant as it provides information about Hänt Extra being a Swedish language weekly magazine, which helps to distinguish it from the Macedonian magazine in the claim. 3. "Makedonsko Sonce" context: While this context is about a Macedonian weekly magazine, it does not directly answer the claim but is still relevant due to the geographical and topical connection. 4. "Hänt Bild" context: This context is about another Swedish magazine, which is less directly relevant to the claim but still provides useful contrast to the Macedonian magazine mentioned in the claim.
idx: [5, 3, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Tea Moderna (magazine)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Tea Moderna" and identifies it as a Macedonian woman's weekly magazine, which is exactly what the claim is asking. It is informative and most likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Hänt Extra" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions "Hänt Extra" and provides information that it is a Swedish language weekly magazine, which helps to distinguish it from the Macedonian weekly in question. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim about a Macedonian weekly but is still informative. 3. "Makedonsko Sonce" context: Although this context is about a weekly magazine published in the Republic of Macedonia, it does not directly answer the claim but is relevant due to its geographical and thematic proximity. It is less likely than the first two contexts to contain the direct answer to the claim. 4. "Hänt Bild" context: This context is informative about a celebrity magazine published in Sweden, but it is not directly relevant to the claim about a Macedonian weekly magazine. It is the least likely to contain the answer to the claim.

It is highly relevant and likely contains part of the answer to the claim. 2. "Echosmith" context: This context provides the formation details of Echosmith, including the city they were formed in, which is Chino, California. It is highly relevant and likely contains the other part of the answer to the claim. 3. "Something for the Rest of Us" context: This context mentions the recording locations for the Goo Goo Dolls' album, which includes Buffalo. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim. 4. "Live in Buffalo: July 4th, 2004" context: This context mentions a live performance by the Goo Goo Dolls in Buffalo, indicating a connection to the city but does not directly address the formation of the band. 5. "Hold Me Up" context: This context talks about the Goo Goo Dolls' album and the emergence of John Rzeznik as the lead vocalist, which is informative but not directly relevant to the claim. 6. "ITunes Originals – Goo Goo Dolls" context: This context is about an album release and includes interviews, which might provide some background but is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 7. "Notbroken" context: This context is about a single from the Goo Goo Dolls and does not seem to be relevant to the claim. 8. "All That You Are (Goo Goo Dolls song)" context: This context is about a song by the Goo Goo Dolls for a movie soundtrack, which is not relevant to the claim. 9. "Waiting for the Rest of It" context: This context is about an EP release and its promotion, which is not relevant to the claim. 10.

idx: [1, 8, 0, 4, 6, 2, 3, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine the top 4 ranked contexts, I will evaluate each context based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context idx 1: This context provides detailed information about the formation of the Goo Goo Dolls in Buffalo, New York, which is directly relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context details the formation of Echosmith in Chino, California, which is essential to answer the claim. 3. Context idx 4: This context mentions the Goo Goo Dolls and their connection to Buffalo, New York, adding relevance to the claim. 4. Context idx 0: Although this context is about the Goo Goo Dolls, it focuses on their album and does not mention their formation location, making it less relevant than the previous contexts. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not provide information about the formation cities of the bands.
idx: [1, 8, 4, 0]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about the formation city of both bands. 1. "Goo Goo Dolls" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the formation of the Goo Goo Dolls in Buffalo, New York. It directly addresses half of the claim regarding the city of formation for one of the bands. 2. "Echosmith" context: This context is equally relevant as it provides the formation details of Echosmith in Chino, California. It addresses the other half of the claim regarding the city of formation for the second band. 3. "Live in Buffalo: July 4th, 2004" context: This context is related to the Goo Goo Dolls and mentions Buffalo, New York, but it does not add new information regarding the formation city, which is already covered in the first context. 4. "Something for the Rest of Us" context: This context discusses the Goo Goo Dolls' album and recording process in Buffalo but is less relevant to the claim's focus on the bands' formation cities.

2. "Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Initiative" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses a game that is a modification of the "Portal" series, developed by Valve, and released in 2014, which is close to the 2012 date mentioned in the claim.
3. "Portal (video game)" context: This context is relevant as it talks about the first game in the "Portal" series, which is a puzzle-platform game developed by Valve.
4. "Portal (series)" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about the "Portal" series as a whole, which includes the games developed by Valve that fit the claim's description.
5. "Half-Life 2: Lost Coast" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it is developed by Valve and is related to the "Half-Life 2" game, which shares the same universe as "Portal".
6. "Gateways (video game)" context: This context is less relevant but still worth considering because it mentions gameplay concepts from the "Portal" series.
7. "Fez (video game)" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions a puzzle-platform game but not developed by Valve or related to the 2012 action-adventure game.
8. "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" context: This context is the least relevant to the claim as it does not mention a Valve-developed game or the year 2012.
The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not pertain to Valve-developed games or the specific year mentioned.

The other contexts are less relevant as they either discuss different games or are not directly related to the claim about a 2012 action-adventure game that includes a Valve-developed puzzle-platform game.
idx: [7, 2, 6, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "Portal (series)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the "Portal" series developed by Valve Corporation, which is directly related to the claim. It provides detailed information about the series, gameplay, and connection to the "Half-Life" universe, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Portal 2" context: This context is also very relevant because it discusses "Portal 2," a part of the "Portal" series and developed by Valve Corporation. It provides specific details about the game's development, release, and features, which are informative and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Initiative" context: While this context is about a game related to the "Portal" series, it is less directly related to the claim than the previous contexts. However, it is still relevant and informative, discussing a game that modifies the "Portal" series mechanics, and it might contain the answer to the claim. The "Gateways (video game)" context is related to the "Portal" series in terms of gameplay concepts but is not developed by Valve Corporation and is not part of the 2012 action-adventure game mentioned in the claim, making it the least relevant of the four.

Earth Island Institute" context: This context mentions a Supreme Court case decided 5-4, which is relevant to the claim's focus on the decision ratio. However, it is not one of the cases mentioned in the claim, so it is less relevant. 4. "Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt" context: This context mentions a Supreme Court case decided 5-3, which is close to the claim's focus on a 5-4 decision, but it is not the exact ratio in question. 5. "V.L. v. E.L." context: This context discusses a Supreme Court case, but it does not mention the decision ratio, making it less relevant to the claim. 6. "Commissioner v. Banks" context: This context is about a Supreme Court case, but it does not mention the decision ratio, so it is less relevant. 7. "United States v. Quiver" context: This context is about a Supreme Court case, but it is from 1916 and does not mention the decision ratio, making it less relevant. 8. "Hoffman v. Jones" context: This context is about a Supreme Court case, but it is from the Supreme Court of Florida, not the United States Supreme Court, making it less relevant to the claim. The remaining contexts are not directly related to the Supreme Court or the decision ratio and are therefore ranked lower.

step-by-step think:1. "Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan" context: This context is directly relevant to the claim as it mentions the case by name and confirms that it was decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court of the United States. It is highly informative and definitely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Berghuis v. Thompkins" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the other case in the claim, but it does not provide information about the decision being 5-4, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first context. 3. "Summers v. Earth Island Institute" context: While this context mentions a Supreme Court case decided 5–4, it is not one of the cases mentioned in the claim, making it less relevant. However, it is still informative regarding Supreme Court decisions. 4. "Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt" context: This context is about a Supreme Court case decided 5-3, which is not the decision split asked for in the claim, but it is still a Supreme Court case decision, which gives it some relevance.

step-by-step think:1. "Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan" context: This context is directly relevant to the claim as it mentions the case by name and confirms that it was decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court of the United States. It is highly informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Berghuis v. Thompkins" context: While this context mentions another Supreme Court case, it does not state the decision was 5-4, making it less relevant to the specific claim about the decision margin. However, it is still a Supreme Court case and could be considered for context. 3. "Summers v. Earth Island Institute" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a Supreme Court case decided 5–4, which is close to the claim's focus on the decision margin. However, it is not one of the cases mentioned in the claim, so it ranks lower. 4. "Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt" context: This context is informative about a Supreme Court case but is less relevant to the claim since the decision was 5-3, not 5-4.

Context idx 2: Mentions an album with a similar name "Not the Boy Next Door," which could be confused with the correct album. 7. Context idx 3: Mentions Rick Astley's desire to shed his "boy next door" image, which is tangentially related to the album title. 8. Context idx 4: Discusses the "boy next door" archetype, which is the least relevant but still connected to the key phrase.
idx: [7, 5, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

step-by-step think:1. Context index 7: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions "The Boy Next Door" as a 2003 album by jazz singer Stacey Kent, which is the exact answer to the claim. 2. Context index 5: This context is highly relevant because it also mentions Stacey Kent and the album "The Boy Next Door," providing additional information about a song covered in the album. 3. Context index 9: This context provides information about Stacey Kent herself, which is relevant to the claim but does not directly mention the album. 4. Context index 1: This context is less relevant than the others, but it mentions "The Boy Next Door" in a different context, which might lead to confusion but still holds some relevance.
idx: [7, 5, 9, 1]

However, it supports the information given in the more relevant contexts. 4.

Question:The actor who appeared on Charlotte's Shorts and Weeds was born in what year?
golden idx: [1, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify which contexts mention "Charlotte's Shorts" and "Weeds" since the question is about an actor who appeared in both. Contexts that mention either show and provide actor names will be considered highly relevant. Next, I will look for contexts that mention actors' birth years, as this is the specific information requested. 

1. Context 1 ("Charlotte's Shorts"): This context is highly relevant because it mentions "Charlotte's Shorts" and lists actors involved with the show. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 6 ("Andy Milder"): This context mentions "Weeds" and provides the birth year of Andy Milder, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
3. Context 4 ("Andy Umberger"): This context mentions "Weeds" and provides extensive information about Andy Umberger, making it relevant.
4. Context 8 ("Gary Anthony Williams"): This context mentions "Weeds" and provides the birth year of Gary Anthony Williams, making it relevant.
5. Context 0 ("Spencer Bell (actor)"): This context is informative but does not mention "Charlotte's Shorts" or "Weeds," making it less likely to contain the answer.
6. Context 2 ("Billy Sullivan (actor)"): This context is informative but does not mention "Charlotte's Shorts" or "Weeds," making it less likely to contain the answer.
7. Context 3 ("Charles Eldridge"): This context is informative but does not mention "Charlotte's Shorts" or "Weeds," making it less likely to contain the answer.
8. Context 9 ("Harry Bowen (actor)"): This context is informative but does not mention "Charlotte's Shorts" or "Weeds," making it less likely to contain the answer.
9. Context 5 ("A Story of Floating Weeds"): This context is the least relevant as it does not mention the shows or actors related to the claim.
10. Context 7 ("Milton (cartoon)"): This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention the shows or provide information about actors' birth years.

Based on the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer, the top 8 ranked contexts are:
idx: [1, 6, 4, 8, 0, 2, 3, 9]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim and the likelihood that they contain the answer to the question about the actor's birth year. 1. Context from 'Andy Milder': This context is highly relevant as it mentions Andy Milder's involvement in "Weeds" and provides his exact birth date, directly answering the claim. 2. Context from 'Gary Anthony Williams': This context is relevant because it mentions Gary Anthony Williams' appearance in "Weeds," but it does not mention "Charlotte's Shorts." It provides his birth year, which is pertinent to the claim. 3. Context from "Charlotte's Shorts": This context is relevant as it lists actors involved in "Charlotte's Shorts," which could lead to identifying the actor in question, but it does not provide any birth dates. 4. Context from 'Andy Umberger': This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions Andy Umberger's role in "Weeds," but like the previous context, it does not provide a birth date.
idx: [6, 8, 1, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "Andy Milder" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Andy Milder, who was a series regular on "Weeds" and provides his birth date, which directly answers the claim. 2. "Gary Anthony Williams" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Gary Anthony Williams, who appeared on "Weeds", but does not mention "Charlotte's Shorts" or provide a birth date, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Charlotte's Shorts" context: While this context is relevant as it mentions "Charlotte's Shorts", it does not provide any birth dates and only lists actors involved with the show, making it informative but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. 4. "Andy Umberger" context: This context is informative and mentions "Weeds", but does not mention "Charlotte's Shorts" or provide a birth date, making it less relevant to the claim.

1. Context 3 is highly relevant as it mentions Dario Franchitti's career and his contract with the AMG team to compete in touring cars, directly addressing the claim.
2. Context 0 provides detailed information about Dario Franchitti's transition from CART to the IRL, which is relevant to his racing career after being contracted by AMG.

9. Context 7 mentions Dario Franchitti in the context of Johnny Mowlem's career, which is the least relevant to the claim.

Based on the above considerations, the contexts are ranked by relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.

idx: [3, 0, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 1]

step-by-step think:1. Context 3 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Dario Franchitti's contract with the AMG team to compete in touring cars, specifically in the DTM and its successor, the International Touring Car Championship, which is headquartered in Affalterbach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. This context is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

It provides a broader view of his career changes and is likely to contain useful information regarding the claim. 3. Context 4 is somewhat relevant as it discusses a specific event in the CART series where Dario Franchitti won, but it does not mention his contract or the team headquartered in Affalterbach. It is informative but less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim. 4. Context 5 provides information about a win in the IndyCar Series, which is relevant to Dario Franchitti's career but does not directly address the claim about the team headquartered in Affalterbach or the series he competed in after being contracted by them.

idx: [3,0,4,5]

step-by-step think:1. Context with 'idx': 3 is the most relevant as it mentions Dario Franchitti's career progression, including his contract with the AMG team to compete in touring cars, which is directly related to the claim. It provides a comprehensive overview of his career and the series he competed in after being contracted by the team in Affalterbach, which is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context with 'idx': 0 is the second most relevant as it discusses the 2002 Gran Premio Telmex-Gigante and mentions Dario Franchitti's move from CART to the IRL, which is informative and indirectly related to the claim. It provides insight into the series he was involved in during the time period in question. 3. Context with 'idx': 4 is relevant as it details a specific event (1998 Molson Indy Vancouver) where Dario Franchitti competed, which shows the series he was active in, but it is less directly related to the claim than the first two contexts.

It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer. 3.

It is relevant and may contain the answer. 4. Context idx 0: This context mentions Tukufu Zuberi's involvement in "500 Years Later" and provides background on his role as a filmmaker and sociologist.

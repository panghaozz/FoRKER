Question:Were Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood of the same nationality?
golden idx: [1, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine the nationality of Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood, I will focus on contexts that provide biographical information about these individuals. 1. "Scott Derrickson" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Scott Derrickson is an American, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Ed Wood" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides biographical information about Ed Wood, confirming he was an American, thus answering the other half of the claim. 3. "Ed Wood (film)" context: While this context is about a film concerning Ed Wood, it may contain information about his nationality indirectly through the portrayal of his life. 4. "Deliver Us from Evil (2014 film)" context: This context mentions a film directed by Scott Derrickson, which could potentially contain information about his nationality in the director's bio section. 5. "Doctor Strange (2016 film)" context: Similar to the previous context, this one is about a film directed by Derrickson and might include details about his nationality. 6. "Sinister (film)" context: This context is about another film by Scott Derrickson and could contain biographical information. 7. "Conrad Brooks" context: This context mentions Ed Wood's films, which could lead to information about Wood's nationality. 8. "Adam Collis" context: This context is less directly related but mentions work with Scott Derrickson, which could potentially lead to information about Derrickson's nationality.
idx: [1, 8, 2, 6, 7, 9, 5, 0]

step-by-step think: The claim asks whether Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood were of the same nationality. To answer this, we need to identify the nationalities of both individuals.
1. "Scott Derrickson" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Scott Derrickson is an American director, which directly answers half of the claim regarding Derrickson's nationality.
2. "Ed Wood" context: This context is equally relevant because it states that Ed Wood was an American filmmaker, actor, writer, producer, and director, which addresses the other half of the claim regarding Wood's nationality.
3. "Ed Wood (film)" context: While this context is about the biographical film of Ed Wood, it does not directly address his nationality but is related to the subject of the claim.
4. "Conrad Brooks" context: This context mentions that Conrad Brooks appeared in Ed Wood films, which provides a tangential connection to Ed Wood, but it is less directly relevant to the claim than the contexts that explicitly mention the nationalities of Derrickson and Wood.
The other contexts are about specific works of Scott Derrickson and do not provide information about his nationality or that of Ed Wood.

idx: [1, 8, 2, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is about the nationality of Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood. 1. "Scott Derrickson" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms Scott Derrickson's nationality as American. It directly addresses half of the claim. 2. "Ed Wood" context: This context is equally relevant as it confirms Ed Wood's nationality as American. It addresses the other half of the claim. 3. "Ed Wood (film)" context: While this context is about the film named after Ed Wood and includes information about the film's cast and crew, it is less directly relevant to the claim about nationality. However, it is still somewhat relevant as it pertains to Ed Wood. 4. "Conrad Brooks" context: This context is about an actor associated with Ed Wood but does not provide direct information about the nationalities of Scott Derrickson or Ed Wood. It is the least relevant to the claim.

Question:What government position was held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell?
golden idx: [6, 7]
# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim about the government position held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film "Kiss and Tell". The most relevant context will be the one that mentions Shirley Temple, the actress who played Corliss Archer, and her government positions. Contexts that mention the film or related works will have medium relevance, and contexts about unrelated government positions or other individuals will have the lowest relevance.
1. Context idx 6: Directly mentions Shirley Temple and her government positions, making it the most relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context idx 7: Discusses the film "Kiss and Tell" and Shirley Temple's role, which is highly relevant to the claim.
3. Context idx 3: Talks about the sequel to "Kiss and Tell", which is somewhat relevant as it may provide additional context about the actress and the original film.
4. Context idx 0: Mentions Janet Waldo, who voiced a character in the radio version of "Meet Corliss Archer", which is related but less directly so than contexts about Shirley Temple.
5. Context idx 1: Provides information about the TV series adaptation of "Meet Corliss Archer", which is related to the claim but does not mention government positions.
6. Context idx 5: Discusses the radio program "Meet Corliss Archer", which is related to the claim but less likely to contain information about Shirley Temple's government roles.
7. Context idx 4: Mentions Charles Craft's work on the "Meet Corliss Archer" TV series, which is tangentially related to the claim.
8. Context idx 9: Talks about the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, a government position, but unrelated to Shirley Temple or the claim.
# The remaining contexts (idx 2 and 8) are about government positions unrelated to the claim and do not mention Shirley Temple or the film, so they are not included in the top 8.
# idx: [6,7,3,0,1,5,4,9]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the government position held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film "Kiss and Tell". The most relevant context would be the one that mentions Shirley Temple, the actress who played Corliss Archer, and her roles as a diplomat. 1. "Shirley Temple" context: This is the most relevant context as it directly mentions Shirley Temple's roles as United States ambassador to Ghana and to Czechoslovakia, and as Chief of Protocol of the United States. 2. "Kiss and Tell (1945 film)" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Shirley Temple portraying Corliss Archer in the film, which is directly related to the claim. 3. "A Kiss for Corliss" context: This context is informative as it talks about the sequel to "Kiss and Tell" and Shirley Temple's role in it, which may help confirm her identity in relation to the claim. 4. "Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)" context: Although this context is about the TV series adaptation and not the film, it is still relevant as it could provide additional background on the character of Corliss Archer. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention Shirley Temple's government roles or her portrayal of Corliss Archer.
idx: [6, 7, 3, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Shirley Temple" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Shirley Temple, the actress who portrayed Corliss Archer, and provides information about her roles as United States ambassador to Ghana and to Czechoslovakia, as well as Chief of Protocol of the United States. It directly answers the claim. 2. "Kiss and Tell (1945 film)" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the film "Kiss and Tell" and Shirley Temple's role as Corliss Archer. However, it does not provide information about her government position. 3. "A Kiss for Corliss" context: This context is related to the sequel of the film "Kiss and Tell" and mentions Shirley Temple's final film appearance, but it does not provide information about her government position. 4. "Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses the television adaptation of the series that inspired the film and does not mention Shirley Temple or her government position.

Question:What science fantasy young adult series, told in first person, has a set of companion books narrating the stories of enslaved worlds and alien species?
golden idx: [6, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about a science fantasy young adult series told in first person, with companion books about enslaved worlds and alien species. 1. "Animorphs" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions a science fantasy series told in first person and includes companion books that narrate stories of alien species, which aligns closely with the claim. 2. "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles" context: This is a companion book to the "Animorphs" series, directly addressing the part of the claim about companion books and enslaved species. 3. "List of Square Enix companion books" context: While this context talks about companion books, it is about video games rather than a young adult series, making it less relevant. 4. "Victoria Hanley" context: This context mentions companion books to a fantasy series, but there is no mention of first-person narration or enslaved worlds. 5. "The Divide trilogy" context: This context is about a fantasy young adult trilogy, but it does not mention companion books or the specific themes from the claim. 6. "Etiquette & Espionage" context: This context is about a young adult series set in the same universe as another series, but it lacks the elements of science fantasy and companion books related to the claim. 7. "Science Fantasy (magazine)" context: The title is misleading as it does not pertain to a young adult series but rather a magazine, making it less relevant. 8. "Shadowshaper" context: This context is about an urban fantasy young adult novel, which does not fit the science fantasy genre or mention companion books. 9. "Andre Norton Award" context: This context is about an award for young adult books and does not provide information about a specific series or companion books. 10. "Left Behind: The Kids" context: This context is about a young adult series but does not match the science fantasy genre or mention companion books related to the claim.
idx: [8, 6, 1, 2, 4, 0, 3, 7]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim, the informativeness of the content, and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles" context: This is highly relevant as it is a companion book to the "Animorphs" series, which fits the description of the claim. It narrates the story of enslaved worlds and alien species, which is exactly what the claim is looking for. 2. "Animorphs" context: This context is relevant because it describes the "Animorphs" series, which is told in first person and has companion books like "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles". 3. "Science Fantasy (magazine)" context: While this context is about a magazine that served as a companion to "New Worlds", it is less directly related to the claim than the contexts about the "Animorphs" series. However, it is still relevant to the genre of science fantasy. 4. "Victoria Hanley" context: This context talks about companion books within a young adult fantasy series, which is somewhat relevant but does not mention enslaved worlds or alien species. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention companion books related to enslaved worlds and alien species.
idx: [6, 8, 3, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Animorphs" context: This context is highly relevant as it describes the "Animorphs" series, which is a science fantasy series of young adult books told in first person. It directly addresses the claim by mentioning the series and its narrative style. 2. "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles" context: This context is also very relevant because it is a companion book to the "Animorphs" series and narrates the story of enslaved worlds and alien species, which is exactly what the claim is seeking. 3. "Victoria Hanley" context: While this context talks about companion books to a young adult fantasy series, it does not mention the first-person narrative or the specific themes of enslaved worlds and alien species. Therefore, it is less relevant than the first two contexts but still more relevant than the "Science Fantasy (magazine)" context, which is about a magazine and not a book series.

Question:Are the Laleli Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion located in the same neighborhood?
golden idx: [3, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine the relevance of the contexts to the claim about the Laleli Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion being in the same neighborhood, I will prioritize contexts that mention either the Laleli Mosque or the Esma Sultan Mansion and provide location information. 1. "Laleli Mosque" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Laleli Mosque and specifies its location in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, which is crucial for answering the claim. 2. "Esma Sultan Mansion" context: This context is equally important because it mentions the Esma Sultan Mansion and its location in Ortaköy, Istanbul, providing the necessary information to determine if they are in the same neighborhood. 3. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdülaziz)" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions Esma Sultan, who is associated with the Esma Sultan Mansion, but it does not provide location information. 4. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdul Hamid I)" context: Similar to the previous context, it mentions Esma Sultan but lacks direct relevance to the claim's location aspect. 5. "Gevheri Kadın" context: This context is related through the mention of Esma Sultan but is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 6. "Küçük Hüseyin Pasha" context: This context is indirectly related through the marriage to Esma Sultan but does not provide location information. 7. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Ahmed III)" context: This context mentions another Esma Sultan, which could cause confusion and is less relevant. 8. "Esma Sultan" context: This context is the least relevant as it only mentions the name Esma Sultan without any specific information.
idx: [3, 8, 5, 2, 0, 4, 9, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Laleli Mosque" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Laleli Mosque and its location in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, which is crucial to determining if it's in the same neighborhood as the Esma Sultan Mansion. 2. "Esma Sultan Mansion" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides the location of the Esma Sultan Mansion in Ortaköy, Istanbul, allowing us to compare the two locations. 3. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdülaziz)" context: While this context mentions Esma Sultan, it focuses on the historical figure rather than the mansion and therefore is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdul Hamid I)" context: Similar to the previous context, this one also discusses a historical figure named Esma Sultan but does not provide information about the location of the mansion. 5. "Gevheri Kadın" context: This context is about the mother of Esma Sultan and does not provide information about the location of the mansion or mosque. 6. "Küçük Hüseyin Pasha" context: This context is about an Ottoman admiral who married Esma Sultan, and while it is informative, it does not help answer the claim about the locations. 7. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Ahmed III)" context: This context also discusses a historical figure named Esma Sultan but is not relevant to the claim. 8. "Esma Sultan" context: This context mentions that Esma Sultan is the name of three daughters of three Ottoman Sultans, which is not directly relevant to the claim.

"Esma Sultan Mansion" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the specific location of the Esma Sultan Mansion in the Ortaköy neighborhood of Istanbul, which is necessary to compare with the location of the Laleli Mosque. 3. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdülaziz)" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on the biography of Esma Sultan rather than the location of the mansion named after her. 4. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdul Hamid I)" context: This context is the least relevant because it discusses historical figures without any reference to the location of the Esma Sultan Mansion or its neighborhood.

It is informative and supports the context of the claim. 3. "2006–07 QMJHL season" context: This context mentions the Lewiston Maineiacs and their performance during the season, which is somewhat relevant but does not provide information about the seating capacity of the arena. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts.

Question:What screenwriter with credits for "Evolution" co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni?
golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the ones that mention both Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni, as they are central to the claim. Context 8 is the most relevant because it mentions "The Family Man," which stars both actors and is co-written by David Weissman, who also has credits for "Evolution." Context 5 is next, as it mentions David Weissman and his film credits, including "Evolution." Although it doesn't mention Téa Leoni, it's highly relevant due to the screenwriter's connection. Context 1 is relevant as it mentions a film starring Nicolas Cage and includes Téa Leoni in a different context, which could lead to the answer. Context 0 mentions a film with Nicolas Cage directed by someone who worked with him on "Gone in 60 Seconds," which could be tangentially relevant. Contexts 2, 4, 6, and 7 mention Nicolas Cage but not in connection with Téa Leoni or "Evolution," making them less relevant. Context 3 mentions Téa Leoni but not in relation to the claim. Context 9 is the least relevant as it doesn't connect to the claim.
idx: [8, 5, 1, 0, 2, 4, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "The Family Man" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both "The Family Man" and "Evolution," directly linking David Diamond and David Weissman to the films in question. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "David Weissman" context: This context is also highly relevant because it names David Weissman as a screenwriter for both "The Family Man" and "Evolution," directly answering the claim. 3. "It Could Happen to You (1994 film)" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions Nicolas Cage but does not link to "Evolution" or "The Family Man." It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Season of the Witch (2011 film)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention "Evolution" or "The Family Man" and therefore is unlikely to contain the answer.
idx: [8, 5, 1, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. "David Weissman" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions David Weissman directly and lists his film credits, including both "Evolution" and "The Family Man," which stars Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "The Family Man" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the film "The Family Man," which stars Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni, and is written by David Diamond and David Weissman. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "It Could Happen to You (1994 film)" context: While this context mentions a film starring Nicolas Cage, it does not relate to Téa Leoni or the film "Evolution." It is less relevant than the first two contexts but still contains useful information about Nicolas Cage's filmography. 4. "Season of the Witch (2011 film)" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention Téa Leoni or the film "Evolution." It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

It provides details about the film and its characters, making it highly relevant. 3. Context idx 9: This context provides information on Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography, which may contain references to his role in "End of Days" and its promotional activities. 4. Context idx 2: This context talks about the film "Last Action Hero", which stars Schwarzenegger as a police detective, but it is not the movie associated with the Guns N' Roses promo. 5. Context idx 6: This context discusses the discography of Guns N' Roses, which could potentially contain information about their contributions to movie soundtracks. 6. Context idx 3: This context mentions Guns N' Roses in relation to Hammerjack's Concert Hall and Nightclub, which is less directly relevant to the claim. 7. Context idx 0: This context discusses Faction Punk and its temporary replacement by Guns N Roses radio, which is tangentially related to the band but not to the claim. 8. Context idx 4: This context is about the film "True Lies", starring Schwarzenegger, but it does not relate to the claim about Guns N' Roses performing a promo.
idx: [1, 8, 9, 2, 6, 3, 0, 4]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the year Guns N' Roses performed a promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. 1. Context 1 ("Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)") is the most relevant as it directly mentions the song by Guns N' Roses released in 1999 for the soundtrack of "End of Days", which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. 2. Context 8 ("End of Days (film)") is the second most relevant because it provides details about the film "End of Days", including its release year (1999) and the fact that Schwarzenegger played a former New York Police detective, which is the subject of the claim. 3. Context 9 ("Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography") is less directly relevant to the claim but still useful as it mentions Schwarzenegger's appearances in music videos, including those for Guns N' Roses. 4. Context 2 ("Last Action Hero") is relevant to Schwarzenegger's film career but does not mention the year or the connection to Guns N' Roses, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not directly address the claim's specifics about the promo and the movie.
idx: [1, 8, 9, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the song by Guns N' Roses that was released in 1999 for the soundtrack of "End of Days", which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.

"Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography" context: While this context mentions Arnold Schwarzenegger's involvement in films and music videos, including those for Guns N' Roses, it does not specifically address the claim about the promo for the movie. However, it is still somewhat relevant as it connects the actor and the band. 4. "Last Action Hero" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a different film ("Last Action Hero") from 1993 and does not mention any promo involving Guns N' Roses.

Question:The football manager who recruited David Beckham managed Manchester United during what timeframe?
golden idx: [4, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about the football manager who recruited David Beckham and managed Manchester United, we need to identify contexts that mention David Beckham in relation to Manchester United and the timeframe of the manager's tenure. 1.

Context idx 3: This context talks about Matt Busby's management of Manchester United, but the timeframe does not match the claim related to David Beckham's recruitment. 6. Context idx 1: Ernest Mangnall's context is informative about his tenure at Manchester United, but it is not relevant to the claim about David Beckham. 7. Context idx 6: The Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex context is named after Matt Busby and mentions his management years, but it is less directly related to the claim. 8.

"1995–96 Manchester United F.C. season" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the season during which Alex Ferguson was the manager and mentions the recruitment of David Beckham. 3. "The Class of '92" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it talks about David Beckham and his rise at Manchester United, which indirectly relates to the timeframe of Ferguson's management. 4.

Question:Brown State Fishing Lake is in a country that has a population of how many inhabitants ?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about the population of the country where Brown State Fishing Lake is located, we need to identify contexts that mention Brown State Fishing Lake and provide information about its location. Context 9 is the most relevant because it specifically mentions Brown State Fishing Lake and its location in Brown County, Kansas, USA. Context 0 is the second most relevant as it provides the population of Brown County, Kansas, which is where the lake is located. Contexts 2, 3, and 8 are also relevant because they mention other lakes in Kansas, indicating the country's population. Context 1 mentions a Fishing Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada, which is not relevant to Brown State Fishing Lake in Kansas. Contexts 4 and 5 mention lakes in Canada, which are not relevant to the claim. Contexts 6 and 7 mention Higgins Lake in Michigan, USA, which is also not relevant to Brown State Fishing Lake in Kansas.
idx: [9, 0, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Brown County, Kansas" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Brown County's population, which is where Brown State Fishing Lake is located. Since the lake is in Brown County, and the county is in the U.S., this context is likely to contain the answer to the claim about the population of the country where the lake is situated. 2. "Brown State Fishing Lake" context: While this context provides detailed information about the lake itself, it does not directly answer the question about the population of the country. However, it is relevant as it establishes the location of the lake. 3. "Neosho State Fishing Lake" context: This context is about another fishing lake in Kansas, which is the same state where Brown State Fishing Lake is located. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention Brown County or Brown State Fishing Lake. 4. "Osage State Fishing Lake" context: Similar to the Neosho State Fishing Lake context, this one is about a lake in Kansas and is therefore somewhat relevant. However, it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim than the contexts that are directly related to Brown County or Brown State Fishing Lake.
idx: [0,9,8,3]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the population of the country where Brown State Fishing Lake is located. 1. "Brown County, Kansas" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Brown County's population and its relation to Brown State Fishing Lake. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Brown State Fishing Lake" context: This context is relevant because it specifies the location of Brown State Fishing Lake, which is in Brown County, Kansas. However, it does not mention the population of the country. 3.

Question:The Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team currently competes in a conference that was formerly known as what from 1988 to 1996?
golden idx: [4, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team's conference history. The most relevant context will be the one that mentions the conference's former name directly. 1. Context idx 4: This context is the most relevant as it directly mentions the America East Conference and its former names, including the North Atlantic Conference from 1988 to 1996, which is the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 5: This context is relevant because it talks about the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team and mentions their participation in the America East Conference. 3. Context idx 9: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses the Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team and their conference, which could lead to information about the conference's history. 4. Context idx 1: This context is less relevant as it focuses on a specific season of the men's basketball team but still mentions the America East Conference. 5. Context idx 2: Similar to idx 1, this context is about a specific basketball season and mentions the conference. 6. Context idx 3: This context is about the basketball team's season and conference participation. 7. Context idx 6: This context also discusses the basketball team's season and mentions the conference. 8. Context idx 7: This context is the least relevant of the basketball contexts but still mentions the conference. The remaining contexts (idx 0 and idx 8) are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the conference or its history.
idx: [4, 5, 9, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "America East Conference" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the name change of the conference, mentioning it was known as the North Atlantic Conference from 1988 to 1996, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Vermont Catamounts men's soccer" context: This context is relevant because it confirms the team competes in the America East Conference, which is the current name of the conference in question. 3. "Vermont Catamounts men's basketball" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions the team competes in the America East Conference, but it does not provide historical information about the conference's former names. 4.

idx: [4,5,9,1]

step-by-step think: 1. "America East Conference" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the name change of the conference from the North Atlantic Conference to the America East Conference, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Vermont Catamounts men's soccer" context: This context is relevant because it confirms the team's participation in the America East Conference, but it does not mention the historical name of the conference. 3.

Question:Are Giuseppe Verdi and Ambroise Thomas both Opera composers ?
golden idx: [4, 5]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim that Giuseppe Verdi and Ambroise Thomas are both opera composers. 1. Context 4: Directly confirms Giuseppe Verdi as an opera composer. 2. Context 5: Directly confirms Ambroise Thomas as an opera composer. 3. Context 9: Lists major opera composers, likely to confirm both as opera composers. 4. Context 2: Mentions a role created by Ambroise Thomas, indicating his work as an opera composer. 5. Context 0: Discusses a film about Giuseppe Verdi, which may imply his profession. 6. Context 7: Another film about Giuseppe Verdi, likely to touch on his career. 7. Context 1: Mentions Verdi's tutor, indicating the context of opera composition. 8. Context 6: Mentions roles in operas by both composers, indicating their professions.
idx: [4,5,9,2,0,7,1,6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Giuseppe Verdi" context: It directly confirms Giuseppe Verdi as an Italian opera composer, which is half of the claim. It is highly relevant and likely contains part of the answer to the claim. 2. "Ambroise Thomas" context: This context directly confirms Ambroise Thomas as a French composer known for his operas, which addresses the other half of the claim. It is equally relevant and likely contains the remaining part of the answer to the claim. 3. "List of major opera composers" context: While this context does not directly mention Verdi or Thomas, it provides a list of significant opera composers, which may include both individuals and thus is relevant to the claim. 4. "Armand Castelmary" context: This context mentions roles created in operas by both Verdi and Thomas, indirectly confirming their status as opera composers. It is less directly relevant than the individual contexts but still likely to contain the answer. The other contexts are either less relevant or about different subjects that do not directly address the claim.
idx: [4, 5, 9, 2]

step-by-step think: 1. "Giuseppe Verdi" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms Giuseppe Verdi's identity as an Italian opera composer, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Ambroise Thomas" context: This context is equally relevant because it verifies Ambroise Thomas as a French composer known for his operas, thus responding to the other half of the claim. 3. "List of major opera composers" context: While this context does not mention Verdi or Thomas directly, it talks about major opera composers in general, which could implicitly confirm their status as opera composers if they are listed. 4. "Armand Castelmary" context: This context is less relevant because it focuses on a different individual, but it mentions both Verdi and Thomas in relation to operas they composed, providing indirect confirmation of their roles as opera composers.

Bennet's tenure as Assistant Secretary of State during the Carter administration, which is not directly related but is within the timeframe of interest. 5. Context 7 mentions Robert Hormats' service under Nixon, which is somewhat relevant to the timeframe of the claim. 6. Context 1 talks about Edward D. Martin's terms, which are not directly related but provide context on the role of an Assistant Secretary. 7. Context 2 discusses Bradford P. Campbell's term under George W. Bush, which is less relevant to the claim. 8. Context 3 details Robert R. Hood's current and past roles, which are not directly related to the claim. The remaining contexts are not included as they are less relevant or informative regarding the claim.
idx: [9, 4, 0, 5, 7, 1, 2, 3]

"Jim Cummings" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Jim Cummings, who sang "A Rather Blustery Day" and lists his voice roles, which may include the hedgehog in question. 2. "A Rather Blustery Day" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the song directly, but it does not mention the hedgehog, so it's less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "The Rain Rain Rain Came Down Down Down" context: This context is related to the same featurette and mentions Sterling Holloway, who provided the voice of Pooh, but does not mention a hedgehog. 4. "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" context: This context provides background on the featurette but does not mention the hedgehog or the singer of the song.

Question:Aside from the Apple Remote, what other device can control the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with?
golden idx: [2, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for a device that can control the program the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with, aside from the Apple Remote itself. 1. "Siri Remote" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Siri Remote, which is a successor to the original Apple Remote and is designed to work with the same devices, including Apple TV. 2. "Front Row (software)" context: This context is relevant because it describes Front Row, the media program that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with. It also mentions that the software can be controlled by the Apple Remote. 3. "Apple Watch" context: The Apple Watch can control Apple TV and other devices, making it relevant to the claim. 4. "Universal remote" context: Universal remotes are designed to control multiple devices, including potentially the Apple TV, which is relevant to the claim. 5. "Remote control" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses the general functionality of remote controls, but it does not specifically mention the Apple TV or the Apple Remote. 6. "Apple Remote Desktop" context: While this context mentions remote control functionality, it is focused on computer administration and not on controlling the Apple TV or similar programs. 7. "NetSupport Manager" context: This software allows remote control of various systems, but it is not directly related to the Apple Remote or the devices it controls. 8. "MacScan" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on malware removal and only tangentially mentions remote administration programs.
idx: [0,2,6,7,8,3,1,4]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider their relevance to the claim about devices that can control the program the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with. 1. "Siri Remote" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Siri Remote, which is a successor to the original Apple Remote and is designed to work with Apple TV, the device the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with. 2. "Front Row (software)" context: This context is relevant because it discusses a software application that was controlled by the Apple Remote. It may contain information about alternative control methods for the software. 3. "Universal remote" context: This context is relevant as it discusses universal remotes, which are designed to operate multiple devices and could potentially control the same program as the Apple Remote. 4. "Remote control" context: This context is generally relevant as it talks about remote controls, but it's less specific to the Apple Remote's program. The other contexts are less likely to contain the answer because they either discuss different products like the Apple Watch and Apple Remote Desktop or are too general like the NetSupport Manager and MacScan.
idx: [0, 2, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Siri Remote" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the Siri Remote, which is a successor to the original Apple Remote and is designed to work with the Apple TV, the device that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Front Row (software)" context: This context is relevant because it mentions that Front Row can be controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys. Since the claim asks for a device other than the Apple Remote, the keyboard function keys are a valid alternative. 3. "Universal remote" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses universal remotes, which can be programmed to operate various consumer electronics devices, potentially including the Apple TV. However, it is less specific to the claim than the Siri Remote or the keyboard function keys mentioned in the Front Row context. 4. "Remote control" context: While this context is informative about remote controls in general, it does not specifically mention the Apple TV or the Apple Remote, making it the least relevant to the claim.

Question:Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? 
golden idx: [0, 2]
To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments and the number of people in each act. The context provided for Wolf Alice indicates they are a four-piece band, which typically means four people with their respective instruments. For Badly Drawn Boy, the context indicates that Damon Gough is a multi-instrumentalist, which suggests he plays more than one instrument.

Here's how I would rank the contexts based on relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim:

1. Context idx 2: This context is about Badly Drawn Boy and mentions that he is a multi-instrumentalist, which is directly relevant to the instrument to person ratio.
2. Context idx 0: This context provides information about the members of Wolf Alice and their roles, which is necessary to determine the number of instruments in relation to the number of people.
3. Context idx 8: This context talks about Badly Drawn Boy's album where he played several instruments, which could give insights into the variety of instruments he uses.
4. Context idx 4: This context discusses Badly Drawn Boy's discography, which may provide additional information on the instruments he plays across his works.
5. Context idx 9: This context is about the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy, which might indicate the use of multiple instruments.
6. Context idx 1: This context is less directly relevant as it talks about a single by Badly Drawn Boy, but it could still provide insight into the instruments used.
7. Context idx 3: Similar to idx 1, this context discusses a single by Badly Drawn Boy and its chart position, which is less relevant to the instrument to person ratio.
8. Context idx 5: This context is about the film "About a Boy" for which Badly Drawn Boy did the music, potentially indicating the use of multiple instruments.

The remaining contexts (idx 6 and 7) are not directly relevant to the claim as they do not provide information about the instrument to person ratio for either act.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the direct relevance to the claim about the instrument to person ratio and the likelihood of the context containing the answer. Contexts directly mentioning Badly Drawn Boy's role as a multi-instrumentalist and the band composition of Wolf Alice were prioritized.
idx: [2, 0, 8, 4, 9, 1, 3, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments compared to the number of people in each act. 1. "Badly Drawn Boy" context: This context mentions that Badly Drawn Boy is a multi-instrumentalist, which suggests a high instrument to person ratio since one person plays multiple instruments. 2. "Wolf Alice" context: This context describes Wolf Alice as a four-piece band, which implies a lower instrument to person ratio compared to a solo multi-instrumentalist. 3. "The Hour of Bewilderbeast" context: This context provides information about Badly Drawn Boy's album where he played several instruments, reinforcing the idea of a high instrument to person ratio. 4. "Badly Drawn Boy discography" context: This context gives an overview of Badly Drawn Boy's work, including albums and singles, but does not directly address the instrument to person ratio. However, it suggests a breadth of work where multiple instruments may be involved.
idx: [2,0,8,4]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 2: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Badly Drawn Boy is a multi-instrumentalist, which directly relates to the claim about instrument to person ratio. 2. Context idx 8: This context provides additional information about Badly Drawn Boy's album where he played several instruments, supporting the relevance to the claim. 3. Context idx 0: This context describes Wolf Alice as a four-piece band, which is necessary information to determine the instrument to person ratio for the comparison.

Kaiser and describes his role as the founder of modern American shipbuilding, including the establishment of Kaiser Shipyards and later Kaiser Ventures. It is very informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2.

golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the name of an adventure in "Tunnels and Trolls", a game designed by Ken St. Andre. Therefore, the most relevant contexts will be those that directly relate to the game "Tunnels and Trolls" or its adventures. 1. Context idx 5: "Arena of Khazan" is a role-playing game adventure for "Tunnels & Trolls" which makes it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 2. Context idx 3: "Tunnels & Trolls" is the main subject of the claim, and this context provides information about the game itself. 3. Context idx 2: "Tunnels & Trolls: Crusaders of Khazan" is a computer adaptation of the game, which may contain references to various adventures within the game. 4. Context idx 6: "Ken St. Andre" is the designer of the game, and information about him could include mentions of specific adventures. 5. Context idx 7: "Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes" shares mechanics with "Tunnels and Trolls" and could potentially reference adventures from the game. 6. Context idx 1: "Starfaring" is another game created by Ken St. Andre, which might not be directly related but could contain comparative references. 7. Context idx 4: "Crank Caverns" involves tunnels and could be mistakenly relevant due to the keyword match, but it's about a physical location and not the game. 8. Context idx 0: "St. Andre's Parish" shares the name but is about a parish and not related to the game or its adventures.
idx: [5, 3, 2, 6, 7, 1, 4, 0]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 5 "Arena of Khazan": This context is highly relevant as it mentions an adventure for "Tunnels & Trolls" which is directly related to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer since it specifies an adventure published by Flying Buffalo. 2. Context idx 2 "Tunnels & Trolls: Crusaders of Khazan": This context is also relevant because it talks about a computer adaptation of the tabletop game, indicating a close relationship with the original game and possible adventures within it. 3. Context idx 3 "Tunnels & Trolls": This context provides background information on the game itself, which is relevant but may not directly answer the claim about a specific adventure. 4. Context idx 7 "Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes": This context is relevant as it mentions that its mechanics are based on those of "Tunnels and Trolls" and talks about adventure modules, which could potentially include the name of the adventure in question.
idx: [5,2,3,7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with 'idx': 5, 'title': 'Arena of Khazan' is the most relevant as it directly mentions an adventure for "Tunnels & Trolls" which is the subject of the claim. 2. Context with 'idx': 2, 'title': 'Tunnels & Trolls: Crusaders of Khazan' is also relevant because it discusses a computer adaptation of the game and is likely to contain information about different adventures within the game. 3. Context with 'idx': 3, 'title': 'Tunnels & Trolls' is relevant as it provides background information about the game itself, which may include details about various adventures. The context with 'idx': 7, 'title': 'Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes' is less relevant because it discusses a different game, even though it mentions that its mechanics are based on "Tunnels and Trolls".

step-by-step think: To address the claim about whether "Freakonomics" and "In the Realm of the Hackers" are both American documentaries, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context idx 9: This context directly mentions "Freakonomics: The Movie" as an American documentary, which is highly relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 6: This context talks about "In the Realm of the Hackers" and specifies it as an Australian documentary, which is crucial for answering the claim. 3. Context idx 1: This context mentions Heidi Ewing's involvement with the "Freakonomics" film, adding relevance to the claim. 4. Context idx 0: While this context discusses "Freakonomics Radio," it is related to the "Freakonomics" brand and could be informative. 5. Context idx 7: This context is about the "Hackers" film, which might be confused with "In the Realm of the Hackers" but is a different American film. 6. Context idx 3: This context discusses Jay Leiderman, who is associated with hacker-activism, which could be tangentially related to "In the Realm of the Hackers." 7. Context idx 8: This context talks about Robin Goldstein, who has connections to the "Freakonomics" blog, providing some relevance. 8. Context idx 2: This context is about "Psycho Realm," a music group, which is the least relevant to the claim but is included as the eighth context due to the limited number of contexts provided.
idx: [9, 6, 1, 0, 7, 3, 8, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Freakonomics (film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that "Freakonomics: The Movie" is an American documentary, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "In the Realm of the Hackers" context: This context is equally important because it specifies that "In the Realm of the Hackers" is an Australian documentary, which answers the other half of the claim. 3. "Heidi Ewing" context: This context mentions Heidi Ewing's involvement with the "Freakonomics" film, providing additional relevant information about the documentary's American origin. 4. "Freakonomics Radio" context: While this context is about the radio program and not the documentary, it is related to the "Freakonomics" book and is American, which could indirectly support the claim regarding the nationality of the documentary.
idx: [9, 6, 1, 0]

step-by-step think:1. "Freakonomics (film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that "Freakonomics: The Movie" is an American documentary, directly addressing half of the claim. It is informative and contains the answer to the claim regarding the nationality of the "Freakonomics" documentary. 2. "In the Realm of the Hackers" context: This context is also highly relevant as it provides information about "In the Realm of the Hackers" being an Australian documentary, which addresses the other half of the claim. It is informative and contains the answer to the claim regarding the nationality of the "In the Realm of the Hackers" documentary. 3. "Heidi Ewing" context: While this context mentions "Freakonomics" and provides information about Heidi Ewing, who directed the film, it is less directly related to the claim compared to the first two contexts. It is informative but does not directly address the claim's question about the nationality of the documentaries.

Question:Which band, Letters to Cleo or Screaming Trees, had more members?
golden idx: [1, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine which band had more members, the contexts that provide specific information about the members of each band are most relevant. 1. "Letters to Cleo" context: This context is highly relevant as it lists the members of Letters to Cleo, directly addressing the claim. 2. "Screaming Trees" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides information about the members of Screaming Trees. 3. "Screaming Trees discography" context: While this context is about the band's discography, it may contain information about the band members in the context of their work. 4. "Gary Lee Conner" context: This context is relevant as it discusses a member of Screaming Trees, which could be useful in determining the total number of members. 5. "Van Conner" context: Similar to the previous context, this one provides information about another member of Screaming Trees. 6.

"Change Has Come" context: This context is about a recording by Screaming Trees and could potentially mention band members. 8. "Mad Season (band)" context: This context is less directly related but includes a member from Screaming Trees, which could be relevant to the claim.
idx: [1,9,8,4,5,3,2,6]

step-by-step think: To determine which band had more members, we need to count the number of members listed for each band. 1. "Letters to Cleo" context: This context lists six members of the band, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Screaming Trees" context: This context mentions four members and indicates a replacement, but does not provide a total count, making it slightly less informative than the "Letters to Cleo" context. 3. "Gary Lee Conner" context: While this context provides information about an individual member of Screaming Trees, it does not offer additional insight into the total number of band members. 4. "Van Conner" context: Similar to the "Gary Lee Conner" context, this provides details about an individual member but does not contribute to the total count. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not provide information about the band members directly.
idx: [1,9,4,5]

step-by-step think:1. "Letters to Cleo" context: This context is highly relevant as it lists all the members of the band Letters to Cleo, which directly addresses the claim about the number of members in the band. 2. "Screaming Trees" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides information about the members of Screaming Trees, which is necessary to answer the claim. 3. "Gary Lee Conner" context: While this context is about a member of Screaming Trees, it focuses on Gary Lee Conner's career and does not provide a count of the band members, making it less relevant than the contexts that list the band members. 4. "Van Conner" context: Similar to the Gary Lee Conner context, this one is about Van Conner and his career. It mentions Screaming Trees but does not provide a count of the members, making it less relevant for answering the claim.

step-by-step think: To determine the top 3 ranked contexts, I will evaluate each context based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context from 'Tata Consultancy Services': This context is highly relevant as it mentions TCS, the company where Sachin Warrier worked, and provides information about its headquarters. It directly answers the claim. 2. Context from 'Sachin Warrier': This context is relevant because it mentions Sachin Warrier's employment at TCS in Kochi, which is related to the claim, but it does not specify the headquarters' location. 3. Context from 'Lead programmer': This context is less relevant as it does not mention Sachin Warrier or TCS, but it discusses software engineering roles, which could be tangentially related to the claim. 4. Context from 'Wes McKinney': This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different individual and companies unrelated to Sachin Warrier or TCS.

Question:A Japanese manga series based on a 16 year old high school student Ichitaka Seto, is written and illustrated by someone born in what year?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. The claim is about a manga series featuring a character named Ichitaka Seto and seeks the birth year of the author.

1. Context idx 4: This context is directly relevant as it mentions the manga series "I"s" and the main character Ichitaka Seto. It also provides the name of the author, Masakazu Katsura, which is crucial for finding the birth year.
2. Context idx 6: This context provides biographical information about Masakazu Katsura, including his birth year, which directly answers the claim.
3. Context idx 0: While this context mentions a manga series and a character named Seto, it does not relate to "I"s" or Masakazu Katsura. It's less relevant but still contains useful information about manga.
4. Context idx 1: This context is about a different manga series and author. It's informative but not directly relevant to the claim.
5. Context idx 2: Similar to idx 1, this context discusses a different manga series and author. It's less relevant to the claim.
6. Context idx 3: This context is about another unrelated manga series. It's informative but unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
7. Context idx 5: This context is about a different manga series with no connection to the claim.
8. Context idx 7: This context is about a manga series based on the Christian Bible, which is not relevant to the claim.
9. Context idx 8: This context discusses "The Prince of Tennis," which is unrelated to the claim.
10. Context idx 9: This context is about "Neuro: Supernatural Detective," which has no relevance to the claim about "I"s" or Masakazu Katsura.

Based on the above evaluation, the contexts are ranked by their relevance and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, with idx 4 and idx 6 being the most relevant.

"Masakazu Katsura" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Masakazu Katsura, the author of the manga series "I"s", and provides his birth year, which directly answers the claim. 2. "I&quot;s" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the manga series "I"s" and its main character, Ichitaka Seto, which is the subject of the claim. However, it does not provide the birth year of the author, which is the specific information requested. 3. "Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto" context: This context is about a different manga series and its author, which is not directly related to the claim but is still within the manga domain. 4. "The Kindaichi Case Files" context: Similar to the previous context, this one is about another manga series, which makes it less relevant than the contexts directly related to "I"s" or Masakazu Katsura. The remaining contexts are about different manga series and do not mention "I"s" or Masakazu Katsura, making them less relevant to the claim.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I considered the relevance to the claim about a medieval fortress in Dirleton bordering a coastal area. Context 5 directly mentions Yellowcraig, a coastal area bordering Dirleton Castle to the south, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 3 mentions Dirleton Castle and its historical lordship, which is relevant but less so than context 5. Context 9 provides information about the castle itself, which is useful but not specifically about the coastal area. Context 7 mentions Dirleton Kirk's location relative to the Firth of Forth, which is north and not the coastal area in question. Context 0, while mentioning East Lothian, is more about the Scottish Borders and not the specific coastal area. Context 1 is about a politician related to East Lothian and not the coastal area. Context 2 is about the Lordship associated with Dirleton Castle, which is relevant to Dirleton but not the coastal area. Context 4 discusses a priory in North Berwick, which is in East Lothian but not directly about the coastal area. Context 6 is about Haddington, which is in East Lothian but not a coastal area. Context 8 is about the broader region of Lothian and Borders, which is less relevant to the specific claim.
idx: [5,3,9,7,0,1,2,4]

Context idx 3 - "Dirleton": This context is relevant because it describes the location of Dirleton and its proximity to various landmarks, including Yellowcraigs and the Firth of Forth, which could help in deducing the answer to the claim. 3. Context idx 9 - "Dirleton Castle": This context provides information about Dirleton Castle, which is the subject of the claim, but does not directly answer the question about the coastal area it borders. 4. Context idx 7 - "Dirleton Kirk": This context is informative about the location of Dirleton Kirk in relation to Dirleton and the Firth of Forth, which is useful for understanding the geography of the area in question.
idx: [5, 3, 9, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Yellowcraigs" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Yellowcraig is bordered to the south by the village of Dirleton and Dirleton Castle, which directly answers the claim about the coastal area bordering Dirleton Castle on the south side. 2. "Dirleton" context: This context is relevant because it describes the location of Dirleton and its relation to surrounding areas, including Yellowcraigs and the Firth of Forth, which may help in understanding the geography related to the claim. 3. "Dirleton Castle" context: While this context provides historical information about Dirleton Castle, it does not mention its relation to the coastal area, making it less relevant than the previous contexts. 4.

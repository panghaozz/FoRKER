The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the film or the character in question. Context 3 mentions the album for the film, which is indirectly related. Context 2 mentions a song from the film's soundtrack, also indirectly related. Context 6 references the title of the play but is about a different work. Contexts 1, 5, 7, and 8 do not appear relevant to the claim.

"The Revengers' Comedies" context: This context references "The Revenger's Tragedy" but is about a different play and does not provide information relevant to the claim. 6. "Emily Jewell" context: This context mentions an actress named Emily Jewell who appeared in a film titled "The Duchess," but it is not related to "The Revengers Tragedy" and does not provide a birthday. 7.

"Skeptical Inquirer" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly describes the Skeptical Inquirer magazine, providing information about its publication by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and its subtitle, which suggests it is not a tabloid-style magazine. 2. "The Progressive Populist" context: This context is equally relevant because it directly describes The Progressive Populist magazine, stating that it is published in tabloid newspaper format, which directly answers the claim. 3. "James Alcock" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions James Alcock's association with Skeptical Inquirer, but it does not directly address the claim about the magazine's style. 4. "CSICon" context: This context is relevant to the extent that it mentions the publisher of Skeptical Inquirer, but it does not provide information about the magazine's style. 5. "Barry Beyerstein" context: This context mentions Beyerstein's contributions to Skeptical Inquirer, which is somewhat relevant but does not address the magazine's style. 6. "Kendrick Frazier" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Frazier's role as editor of Skeptical Inquirer, but again, it does not address the style of the magazine. 7. "Wonder en is gheen Wonder" context: This context is less relevant as it only indirectly references Skeptical Inquirer by mentioning its subtitle influence. 8.

It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Skeptical Inquirer" context: This context is also highly relevant as it directly addresses the other part of the claim by describing Skeptical Inquirer as a bimonthly American magazine with a focus on science and reason, which contrasts with a tabloid-style magazine. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3.

Question:What is the year of the event that occured first, Making Today a Perfect Day was produced, or Frozen was produced?
golden idx: [5, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine the year of the event that occurred first, we need to find the production years of "Making Today a Perfect Day" and "Frozen." Context 5 mentions "Making Today a Perfect Day" was released as a single in 2015, which is directly relevant to the claim. Context 6 mentions "Frozen Fever," a sequel to "Frozen," produced in 2015, which is also relevant as it implies "Frozen" was produced earlier. Context 7 mentions "Perfect Day" in relation to Lou Reed's song, which is not directly relevant. Context 1 mentions "One Perfect Day" from 2004, which is not relevant to the Disney productions. Contexts 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9 are not relevant to the Disney films or their production dates. Therefore, the ranking is based on the direct mention and relevance to the production dates of "Making Today a Perfect Day" and "Frozen."
idx: [5,6,7,1,0,2,3,4]

step-by-step think: To determine the year of the event that occurred first, we need to compare the production years of "Making Today a Perfect Day" and "Frozen." Context 5 provides the release year of "Making Today a Perfect Day" as 2015. Context 6 mentions "Frozen Fever" as a sequel to "Frozen," indicating that "Frozen" was produced earlier. Since the claim asks for the event that occurred first, context 6 is most relevant as it implies "Frozen" was produced before 2015. Context 5 is the second most relevant because it gives the specific year of "Making Today a Perfect Day." The other contexts are not directly related to the claim but are ranked based on their mention of the word "Perfect Day" and their informativeness. Context 4 mentions a song titled "One Perfect Day" from 2004, which is informative but less relevant. Context 7 mentions "Perfect Day" in relation to Lou Reed's song, which is not relevant to the claim. Contexts 0, 2, 3, and 4 are not relevant to the claim as they do not pertain to the production years of "Frozen" or "Making Today a Perfect Day."
idx: [6, 5, 4, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Frozen Fever" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the sequel to "Frozen" and provides the year of production, which is crucial to answering the claim. It is informative and directly related to one of the events in question. 2. "Making Today a Perfect Day" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses the song from "Frozen Fever" and gives the exact release date, which is pertinent to determining the timeline of events. 3. "A Perfect Day (song)" context: While this context is about a song titled "A Perfect Day," it is not related to "Frozen" or "Frozen Fever" and thus is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. The "Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)" context is not relevant to the claim as it does not pertain to "Frozen" or "Frozen Fever" and therefore is not included in the top 3.

Question:Which magazine is published more often, Shonen Jump or Rolling Stone?
golden idx: [7, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine which magazine is published more often, we need to look for contexts that provide information about the publication frequency of "Shonen Jump" and "Rolling Stone". Contexts that mention "Weekly Shonen Jump" suggest a weekly publication frequency, while the context mentioning "Rolling Stone" indicates a biweekly publication. Therefore, contexts that provide details about the publication frequency of "Shonen Jump" are most relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Weekly Shonen Jump" and its transition from a print to a digital format, which suggests a regular publication schedule.
2. Context idx 8: This context talks about "Shonen Jump" and its publication history, including its frequency and changes from the Japanese version.
3. Context idx 0: This context mentions "Weekly Shonen Jump" in relation to a manga artist's work, indicating the magazine's publication frequency.
4. Context idx 1: This context also references "Weekly Shonen Jump" and provides information about its serialization, which is relevant to the claim.
5. Context idx 2: This context mentions the serialization in "Weekly Shonen Jump", adding to the relevance regarding publication frequency.
6. Context idx 3: This context includes details about "Weekly Shonen Jump" and its publication of the "Black Clover" series.
7. Context idx 7: This context is relevant as it provides information about "Rolling Stone", including its biweekly publication frequency.
8. Context idx 5: This context is less relevant as it mentions "Monthly Shonen Jump", which is different from "Weekly Shonen Jump", but it still provides useful information about the publication.

The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not provide direct information about the publication frequency or are less informative regarding the claim.

idx: [4, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Weekly Shonen Jump (American magazine)" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides detailed information about the publication frequency of "Weekly Shonen Jump" in North America, which is a key part of the claim. 2. "Shonen Jump (magazine)" context: This context is also directly relevant to the claim as it discusses the change from a weekly to a monthly publication for the North American version of "Shonen Jump", which directly impacts the frequency of publication. 3. "Rolling Stone" context: This context is relevant because it describes "Rolling Stone" as a biweekly magazine, which is necessary information to determine the publication frequency in comparison to "Shonen Jump". 4. "Rosario + Vampire" context: Although this context is less directly related to the claim, it mentions that a bonus chapter was published in "Weekly Shonen Jump", indicating the magazine's publication frequency.
idx: [4, 8, 7, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Weekly Shonen Jump (American magazine)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the publication frequency of "Weekly Shonen Jump" being a digital weekly anthology, which is a direct answer to the claim. 2. "Shonen Jump (magazine)" context: This context is also relevant because it discusses the change from a weekly to a monthly publication for the North American version of "Shonen Jump", providing a contrast to the "Weekly Shonen Jump" and thus, is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Rolling Stone" context: This context is relevant as it mentions that "Rolling Stone" is a biweekly magazine, which allows us to compare its publication frequency with "Shonen Jump". The other context provided, "Rosario + Vampire", is not directly relevant to the claim as it does not provide information about the publication frequency of "Shonen Jump" or "Rolling Stone".

"Cocoa Krispies" context: This context is directly related to part of the claim, Cocoa Krispies, and provides information about the cereal itself. However, it does not mention the location of the company, so it is slightly less relevant in answering the location aspect of the claim. 3. "Adventures of Superman (TV series)" context: This context is relevant as it connects Kellogg's with the Superman TV series through sponsorship. It provides background on the show but does not directly address the location of the company, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim than the "Kellogg's" context. 4. "1 Wall Street Court" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a building known as The Cocoa Exchange, which is unrelated to the Cocoa Krispies cereal or the Kellogg Company. It is informative about the building's history and location but does not contribute to answering the claim about the location of the cereal's producer or the TV series' sponsor.

Question:Who was born first Am Rong or Ava DuVernay ?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Am Rong and Ava DuVernay, we need to look at the contexts that provide specific birth dates or years for both individuals. Context 4 provides the birth year of Am Rong as 1929 and his death in May 1975. Context 6 provides the birth date of Ava DuVernay as August 24, 1972. This clearly indicates that Am Rong was born first. The other contexts mention Ava DuVernay but do not provide information on her birth date or Am Rong's birth date, making them less relevant to the claim. Therefore, context 4 is the most relevant and informative, followed by context 6. The remaining contexts are ranked based on their relevance to either Am Rong or Ava DuVernay, as they may contain additional information that could indirectly help answer the claim.
idx: [4, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Am Rong and Ava DuVernay, the contexts directly providing their birth dates are most relevant. 1. "Am Rong" context: This is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth year of Am Rong, which is 1929. It directly answers the claim. 2. "Ava DuVernay" context: This context is equally relevant because it gives the specific birth date of Ava DuVernay, August 24, 1972. It also directly answers the claim. 3. "Spencer Averick" context: This context is less relevant as it does not provide any birth dates but is associated with Ava DuVernay, which could be indirectly useful. 4. "Howard Barish" context: This context is informative about Ava DuVernay's work but does not provide direct information about her birth date; however, it is still related to her. The other contexts are related to Ava DuVernay's work and associates but do not provide information on her birth date, making them less relevant to the claim.
idx: [4, 6, 0, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Am Rong" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the birth year of Am Rong, which is directly related to the claim about who was born first. It is informative and contains the exact answer to the claim. 2. "Ava DuVernay" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the birth date of Ava DuVernay, which is necessary to answer the claim. It is detailed and directly addresses the question of who was born first. 3. "Spencer Averick" context: While this context is less directly related to the claim, it mentions Ava DuVernay and could provide additional context or information related to her, making it somewhat relevant. However, it is less likely to contain the direct answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts.

5. "Jersey Boys: Original Broadway Cast Recording" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses the musical about Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, but it is less directly related to Valli's singing with the band.
6. "Valli (album)" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on Frankie Valli's solo album, which does not directly answer the claim about him singing with a group.
7. "Bobby Fox" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on an actor portraying Frankie Valli, providing no information about Valli's actual singing career.
8. "Dean Valli" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different person with the last name Valli who is not related to the music industry.

idx: [7, 2, 3, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "The Four Seasons (band)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Frankie Valli's association with The Four Seasons, providing a detailed history of the band and Valli's role in it. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "The Wonder Who?" context: This context is also relevant because it discusses a pseudonym used by The Four Seasons, which included Frankie Valli, and describes their music style and recordings. It supports the information about Valli's involvement with The Four Seasons. 3. "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a single credited to Frankie Valli and co-written by a bandmate from The Four Seasons, indicating Valli's solo work as well as his connection to the band. It is less directly related to the claim than the first two contexts but still provides useful information about Valli's career. The context about "My Eyes Adored You" is informative regarding Valli's solo career and the song's history, but it does not mention Hellogoodbye and is therefore less relevant to the claim.

Question:Both Sorbaria and Goldenrod are a genus of more than 50 flowering plants?
golden idx: [2, 6]
step-by-step think: To address the claim that both Sorbaria and Goldenrod are a genus of more than 50 flowering plants, we must find contexts that provide information about the number of species within these genera. 1. Context idx 6: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Goldenrod (Solidago) is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants. It directly addresses the claim regarding the number of species in the Goldenrod genus. 2. Context idx 2: This context is relevant because it provides the exact number of species in the Sorbaria genus, which is around 9 species. This directly contradicts the claim that Sorbaria has more than 50 species. 3. Context idx 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9: These contexts are about specific species or subgroups within the Goldenrod genus and do not provide information about the total number of species within the genus. They are informative but less relevant to the claim compared to contexts that discuss the genus as a whole.
idx: [6,2,0,1,3,4,5,7]

step-by-step think:1. "Goldenrod" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Goldenrod (Solidago) is a genus with about 100 to 120 species, which directly addresses the claim regarding the number of species in the genus. 2. "Sorbaria" context: This context is also relevant because it provides the exact number of species in the Sorbaria genus, which is necessary to verify the claim. 3. "Solidago elongata" context: While this context provides information on a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, it is less relevant than the general information about the genus as a whole. 4. "Solidago rugosa" context: This context is similar to the previous one in that it provides details on a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, but it is still less relevant than the general information about the genus. The remaining contexts are about specific species or related genera and are therefore less relevant to the claim.
idx: [6,2,0,7]

step-by-step think: 1. "Goldenrod" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Goldenrod (Solidago) is a genus with about 100 to 120 species, which directly addresses the claim regarding the number of species in the genus. 2. "Sorbaria" context: This context is also relevant because it provides the exact number of species in the Sorbaria genus, which is necessary to verify the claim. 3. "Solidago elongata" context: While this context provides detailed information about a specific species within the Goldenrod genus, it is less relevant than the general information about the entire genus but still useful for understanding the diversity within the genus. 4. "Solidago rugosa" context: Similar to the "Solidago elongata" context, this provides specific information about another species within the Goldenrod genus, which is less relevant to the claim about the number of species in the genus.

golden idx: [3, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the context that directly mentions Charles Deaton and the stadiums he designed, as this is most relevant to the claim. Context 3, which mentions Charles Deaton as the designer of Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium, is the most relevant and informative. Context 9 provides the capacity of Arrowhead Stadium, which is also designed by Charles Deaton, making it the second most relevant. Context 4 mentions the Truman Sports Complex, which includes both Arrowhead and Kauffman Stadiums, so it's the third most relevant. Context 5 is about the Sculptured House designed by Deaton and is less relevant to the claim but still related to Deaton's work. The remaining contexts mention Kauffman Stadium but are not directly related to the claim about other stadiums designed by Deaton or their capacities. Therefore, they are ranked lower based on their relevance and informativeness regarding the claim.

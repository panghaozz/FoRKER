golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: 
1. Context 8 ("Buck-Tick") is the most relevant as it directly mentions that Buck-Tick is a Japanese rock band formed in Fujioka, Gunma in 1983. This context is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 7 ("Atsushi Sakurai") is also highly relevant as it mentions that Atsushi Sakurai, the vocalist of Buck-Tick, was born in Fujioka, Gunma, and has been with the band since 1985. This context is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context 3 ("Masami Tsuchiya") is relevant as it mentions that Masami Tsuchiya has worked with the Japanese rock band Buck-Tick. This context is somewhat likely to contain the answer to the claim.
4. Context 6 ("Kyo (musician)") is relevant as it mentions that Kyo was inspired to become a musician when he saw a picture of Buck-Tick vocalist Atsushi Sakurai. This context is somewhat likely to contain the answer to the claim.
5. Context 1 ("Mild and Hazy") is not directly relevant to the claim as it discusses a single by Canadian singer-songwriter Hayden. This context is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
6. Context 4 ("Skyscraper National Park") is not directly relevant to the claim as it discusses an album by Canadian singer-songwriter Hayden. This context is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
7. Context 5 ("Hayden (musician)") is not directly relevant to the claim as it discusses the biography of Canadian singer-songwriter Hayden. This context is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
8. Context 0 ("Alberta Hail Project") is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a research project on hailstorm physics and dynamics in Alberta, Canada. This context is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
9. Context 2 ("Dewey Beard") is not relevant to the claim as it discusses the biography of Dewey Beard, a Minneconjou Lakota. This context is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.
10. Context 9 ("Hailstorm Alley") is not relevant to the claim as it discusses an area in Alberta, Canada known for hailstorms. This context is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:In what year did the submarine that sank the Tsushima Maru open to public tours?
golden idx: [2, 8]
idx: [2, 8]
Step by step with evidence and explanation: 

First, let's examine context at index 2, which discusses the USS Bowfin submarine. It mentions that since 1981, the USS Bowfin has been open to public tours at the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum and Park in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This provides direct evidence of a submarine being open for public tours, establishing the plausibility of submarines being open to public visits.

Secondly, let's consider context at index 8, which specifically discusses the Tsushima Maru, a Japanese passenger/cargo ship sunk by the USS Bowfin during World War II. While this context doesn't directly mention public tours, it establishes a historical event involving the USS Bowfin and the sinking of the Tsushima Maru. This event's historical significance could likely prompt public interest in visiting the submarine that was involved in such a significant historical event. Therefore, it indirectly supports the claim by providing historical context that could contribute to the decision to open the submarine for public tours.

These two pieces of context are the most effective in providing support for the claim as they directly and indirectly establish the plausibility and historical significance of the USS Bowfin being open to public tours.

Question:What piece was composed in 1937 for the American Bandmasters Association and has a melody similar to Green Bushes?
golden idx: [1, 9]
idx: [1, 9]
Step by step with evidence and explanation: 

1. The context at index 1 titled "Lincolnshire Posy" directly addresses the claim by stating that it is a piece composed in 1937 for the American Bandmasters Association. This composition, considered Percy Grainger's masterpiece, is significant because it contains a melody similar to Green Bushes, as mentioned in the claim. The paragraph specifies that Lincolnshire Posy is a composition for concert band, debuting with three movements in 1937. This directly aligns with the claim's reference to a piece composed in 1937 for the American Bandmasters Association and having a melody akin to Green Bushes. Hence, this context provides concrete evidence supporting the claim.

2. The context at index 9 titled "Green Bushes" also effectively supports the claim. It provides crucial information about Green Bushes being an English folk song and mentions its similarity in melody to the "Lost Lady Found" movement of Percy Grainger's Lincolnshire Posy. This directly corroborates the claim's assertion regarding the similarity of melodies between Green Bushes and a piece composed for the American Bandmasters Association in 1937. Additionally, it confirms the existence of Green Bushes, further solidifying the claim's accuracy. Therefore, this context serves as another piece of evidence supporting the claim.

Step by step with evidence and explanation: 

First, let's examine context at index 2. It discusses 'Anaseini Takipō Afuha'amango', who was the Queen consort of Tonga from 1909 to 1918. This is relevant because it establishes that there was a queen in power during the years specified in the claim (1918-1944). While the claim doesn't explicitly mention Tonga, the information about a queen's reign within the specified timeframe is essential for eliminating this option from consideration.

Next, let's analyze context at index 9. It mentions 'Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin', who was Queen of Denmark and also Queen of Iceland from 1 December 1918 to 17 June 1944. This directly addresses the claim by providing a queen who reigned during the specified years. As the claim doesn't specify which country the queen belonged to, this information about Queen Alexandrine is crucial for identifying the other country besides Denmark where the queen ruled between 1918 and 1944.

Question:Were Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood of the same nationality?
golden idx: [1, 8]
step-by-step think: To determine if Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood were of the same nationality, I need to find contexts that provide information about their nationalities. 1. "Scott Derrickson" context: This context directly mentions Scott Derrickson and states that he is an American, which is relevant to the claim. 2. "Ed Wood" context: This context provides information about Ed Wood, stating that he was an American filmmaker, which is directly relevant to the claim. 3. "Ed Wood (film)" context: While this context is about a film concerning Ed Wood, it does not directly state his nationality but is related to him. 4. "Deliver Us from Evil (2014 film)" context: This context mentions Scott Derrickson as the director of the film, which is somewhat relevant but does not state his nationality. 5. "Doctor Strange (2016 film)" context: Similar to the previous context, it mentions Scott Derrickson but does not state his nationality. 6. "Adam Collis" context: This context mentions Scott Derrickson in relation to Adam Collis, an American filmmaker, but does not provide nationality information for Derrickson. 7. "Tyler Bates" context: This context mentions Scott Derrickson in a professional capacity, which is less relevant to the claim. 8. "Conrad Brooks" context: This context mentions Ed Wood in relation to Conrad Brooks, an American actor, but does not provide nationality information for Wood. The remaining contexts are not directly relevant to the claim as they do not provide information about the nationalities of Scott Derrickson or Ed Wood.
idx: [1,8,2,6,7,3,0,5]

step-by-step think: To determine the nationality of Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood, we need to look at contexts that provide information about their personal backgrounds. 1. "Scott Derrickson" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that Scott Derrickson is an American director, which directly answers half of the claim regarding his nationality. 2. "Ed Wood" context: This context is equally relevant because it states that Ed Wood was an American filmmaker, directly answering the other half of the claim regarding his nationality. 3. "Ed Wood (film)" context: While this context is about a film concerning Ed Wood, it is less directly relevant to the claim than the contexts that provide biographical information about the individuals themselves. 4. "Conrad Brooks" context: This context mentions that Conrad Brooks started in movies appearing in Ed Wood films and is an American actor, which provides additional confirmation of Ed Wood's nationality indirectly. The other contexts are about works by Scott Derrickson or other individuals and do not directly address the claim about nationality.
idx: [1,8,2,5]

step-by-step think:1. "Scott Derrickson" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms Scott Derrickson's nationality as American. It directly addresses half of the claim regarding Scott Derrickson's nationality. 2. "Ed Wood" context: This context is equally relevant as it confirms Ed Wood's nationality as American. It directly addresses the other half of the claim regarding Ed Wood's nationality. 3. "Ed Wood (film)" context: While this context is about the film named after Ed Wood and includes information about the film's cast and crew, it is less directly related to the claim about the nationalities of Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood. However, it is still somewhat relevant as it pertains to Ed Wood. 4. "Conrad Brooks" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on Conrad Brooks, an actor associated with Ed Wood, but does not provide direct information about the nationalities of Scott Derrickson or Ed Wood.

golden idx: [6, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for a young adult science fantasy series narrated in first person with companion books about enslaved worlds and alien species. 1. "Animorphs" context: This is the most relevant context as it describes a science fantasy series told in first person and includes companion books that fit the description of the claim. 2. "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles" context: This context is highly relevant because it is a companion book to the "Animorphs" series, which directly relates to the claim. 3. "List of Square Enix companion books" context: While this context talks about companion books, they are related to video games and not a young adult series, making it less relevant. 4. "Victoria Hanley" context: This context mentions companion books to a fantasy series, but there is no mention of first-person narration or the specific themes of enslaved worlds and alien species. 5. "The Divide trilogy" context: This context is about a fantasy young adult trilogy, but it does not mention companion books or the themes specified in the claim. 6.

step-by-step think:1. "Animorphs" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the "Animorphs" series, which is a science fantasy series of young adult books told in first person. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles" context: This context is directly related to the "Animorphs" series and discusses the story of enslaved worlds and alien species, which is exactly what the claim is looking for. It is highly relevant and informative. 3. "Science Fantasy (magazine)" context: While this context mentions a magazine related to science fantasy, it does not seem to be directly related to the claim about a young adult series with companion books. However, it is somewhat relevant due to the genre. 4. "The Divide trilogy" context: This context talks about a fantasy young adult novel trilogy, which is relevant to the claim but does not mention companion books or enslaved worlds and alien species. It is less likely to contain the answer compared to the first two contexts.
idx: [8, 6, 3, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "The Hork-Bajir Chronicles" context: This context is highly relevant as it is a companion book to the "Animorphs" series, which fits the claim of a science fantasy young adult series with companion books narrating stories of enslaved worlds and alien species. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Animorphs" context: This context is relevant because it describes the "Animorphs" series, which is a science fantasy young adult series told in first person. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim, especially since it is the main series to which the companion books are related. 3. "Science Fantasy (magazine)" context: While this context is about a science fantasy magazine, it is less relevant because it does not mention companion books or narrating stories of enslaved worlds and alien species. It is informative but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4.

golden idx: [3, 8]

"Laleli Mosque" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Laleli Mosque and provides its location in Istanbul, which is directly related to the claim. 2. "Esma Sultan Mansion" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions the Esma Sultan Mansion and its location in Istanbul, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdülaziz)" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions Esma Sultan, who is associated with the Esma Sultan Mansion, but it does not provide information about its location. 4. "Gevheri Kadın" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions Esma Sultan but does not provide information about the mansion or its location. 5. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdul Hamid I)" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions Esma Sultan but does not provide information about the mansion or its location. 6. "Küçük Hüseyin Pasha" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions Esma Sultan but does not provide information about the mansion or its location. 7. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Ahmed III)" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions Esma Sultan but does not provide information about the mansion or its location. 8. "Esma Sultan" context: This context is less relevant because it only mentions the name Esma Sultan without providing specific information about the mansion or its location. The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the Laleli Mosque or Esma Sultan Mansion or provide information about their locations.
idx: [3, 8, 5, 0, 2, 4, 9, 7]

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Laleli Mosque and its location in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, which is directly related to the claim. 2.

However, it could potentially lead to confusion as it refers to multiple individuals with the name Esma Sultan. 4. Context idx 5: This context is less relevant because it focuses on the biography of Esma Sultan, the daughter of Abdülaziz, and does not provide information about the location of the mansion.
idx: [3, 8, 7, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "Laleli Mosque" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Laleli Mosque and specifies its location in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, which is crucial to determining if it is in the same neighborhood as the Esma Sultan Mansion. 2. "Esma Sultan Mansion" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides the specific location of the Esma Sultan Mansion in Ortaköy neighborhood, Istanbul, allowing for a comparison with the Laleli Mosque's location. 3. "Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdülaziz)" context: While this context provides background information on the namesake of the Esma Sultan Mansion, it does not contribute to the location comparison between the two buildings. 4. "Esma Sultan" context: This context is the least relevant as it only mentions the name Esma Sultan without any reference to the location or the mansion itself.

golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider the relevance to the claim about a screenwriter with credits for "Evolution" who co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. 1. Context idx 5 mentions David Weissman, who has credits for "Evolution" and "The Family Man," which stars Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 2. Context idx 8 is about "The Family Man," which is the film in question, thus very relevant. 3. Context idx 3 mentions Téa Leoni in relation to a movie soundtrack, which is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. Context idx 0 mentions Nicolas Cage and a film he starred in, but not Téa Leoni or "Evolution," so it's less relevant. 5. Context idx 1 features Nicolas Cage but not Téa Leoni or "Evolution." 6. Context idx 2 stars Nicolas Cage but lacks connection to Téa Leoni or "Evolution." 7. Context idx 4 stars Nicolas Cage but has no link to Téa Leoni or "Evolution." 8. Context idx 6 stars Nicolas Cage but is unrelated to Téa Leoni or "Evolution." 9. Context idx 7 stars Nicolas Cage but does not mention Téa Leoni or "Evolution." 10. Context idx 9 stars Nicolas Cage but is irrelevant to the claim about Téa Leoni or "Evolution."
idx: [5, 8, 3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "The Family Man" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions both "Evolution" and "The Family Man," films written by David Weissman, and stars Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. It directly answers the claim. 2. "David Weissman" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions David Weissman's film credits, including "The Family Man" and "Evolution," directly linking to the claim. 3. "Ungod" context: This context mentions Téa Leoni in relation to the "Bad Boys" movie, which provides a connection to the claim but is less direct compared to the first two contexts. 4. "Season of the Witch (2011 film)" context: While this context mentions Nicolas Cage, it does not mention Téa Leoni or the film "Evolution," making it less relevant than the others.
idx: [8, 5, 3, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. "David Weissman" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions David Weissman directly and lists his film credits, including both "The Family Man" and "Evolution," which are essential to the claim. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "The Family Man" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the film "The Family Man," which stars Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni, and is co-written by David Weissman, connecting directly to the claim. However, it does not mention "Evolution," making it slightly less relevant than the first context. 3. "Season of the Witch (2011 film)" context: While this context mentions Nicolas Cage, it does not relate to the claim about the screenwriter of "Evolution" or the film starring Téa Leoni. It is therefore less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. "Ungod" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention the screenwriter, "Evolution," or the film with Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. It is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:What year did Guns N Roses perform a promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective?
golden idx: [1, 8]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance to the claim about Guns N' Roses performing a promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. The most relevant context will be the one that mentions both Guns N' Roses and a movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger fitting the description. 1. Context 1 ("Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)") is the most relevant as it directly mentions the song by Guns N' Roses released for the soundtrack of "End of Days", a film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. 2. Context 8 ("End of Days (film)") is highly relevant because it describes the film "End of Days" which is the movie in question. 3. Context 9 ("Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography") is relevant as it could contain information about the movies Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in, including "End of Days". 4. Context 2 ("Last Action Hero") is somewhat relevant because it mentions Arnold Schwarzenegger as a police detective in a movie, but it's not the correct movie. 5. Context 4 ("Hammerjack's") mentions Guns N' Roses but does not link to the movie or the promo. 6. Context 6 ("Guns N' Roses discography") is relevant to the band but not to the specific claim. 7. Context 0 ("Faction Punk") is less relevant as it only mentions Guns N' Roses in the context of a radio channel. 8. Context 3 ("True Lies") is the least relevant of the contexts that mention Schwarzenegger, as it does not relate to the claim. The remaining contexts (5, 7) do not mention either Guns N' Roses in the context of a movie promo or Arnold Schwarzenegger as a detective and are therefore not relevant.
idx: [1, 8, 9, 2, 4, 6, 0, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. Context 1 ("Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)") is the most relevant as it directly mentions the song by Guns N' Roses released in 1999 for the soundtrack of "End of Days," which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. It also specifies that the song was used as a promo, directly answering the claim. 2. Context 8 ("End of Days (film)") is highly relevant because it provides details about the movie "End of Days," including its release year (1999) and its star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is the subject of the claim. 3. Context 9 ("Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography") is relevant as it mentions Schwarzenegger's involvement in films and music videos, including those for Guns N' Roses, which could potentially contain the answer to the claim. 4. Context 6 ("Guns N' Roses discography") is somewhat relevant as it discusses Guns N' Roses' overall discography, which may provide background information related to the claim but does not directly answer the question.
idx: [1, 8, 9, 6]

step-by-step think:1. "Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the song by Guns N' Roses that was released on the soundtrack for the film "End of Days" in 1999, which aligns with the claim regarding the promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is informative and directly answers the claim. 2. "End of Days (film)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides details about the film "End of Days," including its release year, 1999, and its star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, as a former New York Police detective. It supports the information given in the first context and reinforces the answer to the claim. 3. "Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography" context: While this context is relevant as it mentions Arnold Schwarzenegger's involvement in music videos, including those for Guns N' Roses, it does not directly address the claim about the promo for the movie. However, it is still informative and provides background on Schwarzenegger's career. 4. "Guns N' Roses discography" context: This context provides a broad overview of Guns N' Roses' discography and history but does not specifically mention the promo for the movie "End of Days," making it the least relevant to the claim.

"Ambroise Thomas" context: This context directly confirms Ambroise Thomas as a French composer known for his operas, addressing the other half of the claim. 3.

"Armand Castelmary" context: This context mentions roles created in operas by both Verdi and Thomas, showing their works and confirming their status as opera composers. 5. "Bernhard Bötel" context: This context mentions roles in operas by both Verdi and Thomas, further confirming their work as opera composers. 6.

The remaining contexts are less directly related to the claim as they do not confirm the composers' roles or provide biographical films and information about theaters named after Verdi, which are informative but not directly answering the claim.

idx: [4, 5, 9, 2]

step-by-step think: 1. "Giuseppe Verdi" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms Giuseppe Verdi's identity as an Italian opera composer, directly addressing half of the claim. 2.

"Collie" context: While this context discusses the collie breed in general, which includes the Scotch Collie, it does not specifically mention the Gordon and Irish Setters. However, it is still relevant due to the close relation to the Scotch Collie. 3. "Manchester Terrier" context: This context is about the Manchester Terrier but does not mention any connection to the Gordon and Irish Setters, making it less relevant to the claim. 4. "Toy Manchester Terrier" context: Similar to the Manchester Terrier context, this one also lacks any mention of the Gordon and Irish Setters and is therefore not directly relevant to the claim.

Question:Where is the company that Sachin Warrier worked for as a software engineer headquartered? 
golden idx: [0, 1]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider the relevance to the claim about Sachin Warrier's employer and the likelihood of the context containing the answer to the headquarters location. 1. Context idx 1: "Tata Consultancy Services" is directly relevant as it mentions the company Sachin Warrier worked for and states its headquarters location. 2. Context idx 0: "Sachin Warrier" is relevant because it mentions his employment at Tata Consultancy Services, but it does not state the headquarters location. 3. Context idx 2: "Muthuchippi Poloru" is less relevant as it focuses on Sachin Warrier's music career. 4. Context idx 6: "Divya S. Menon" is somewhat relevant as it mentions Sachin Warrier in the context of music, but it's less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 5. Context idx 7: "Kanave Kalayathe" is similar in relevance to idx 6, mentioning Sachin Warrier in a musical context. 6. Context idx 3: "Sachin Bansal" is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different Sachin who is an entrepreneur. 7. Context idx 4: "Wes McKinney" is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different individual's career. 8. Context idx 5: "Lead programmer" is not relevant to the claim as it does not mention Sachin Warrier or Tata Consultancy Services. 9. Context idx 8: "Alec Muffett" is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different individual's career. 10. Context idx 9: "William Connolley" is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different individual's career.
idx: [1, 0, 2, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts for the claim, I will consider the direct mention of Sachin Warrier's employment and the location of the company's headquarters. 1. Context idx 1: "Tata Consultancy Services" context is the most relevant as it mentions the company's name and its headquarters location, directly answering the claim. 2. Context idx 0: "Sachin Warrier" context is relevant because it confirms Sachin Warrier's employment at Tata Consultancy Services, although it does not mention the headquarters location. 3. Context idx 6: "Divya S. Menon" context mentions Sachin Warrier in relation to his music career, which is less relevant to the claim but still provides information about his professional background. 4. Context idx 7: "Kanave Kalayathe" context mentions Sachin Warrier and provides information about his work, which is tangentially related to the claim.
idx: [1, 0, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context from 'Tata Consultancy Services': This context is highly relevant as it mentions TCS and states that it is headquartered in Mumbai, Maharashtra, which directly answers the claim. 2. Context from 'Sachin Warrier': This context is relevant because it mentions Sachin Warrier's employment at TCS in Kochi, which is related to the claim but does not provide the headquarters location. 3. Context from 'Divya S. Menon': This context is less relevant as it discusses Divya S. Menon's career and her association with Sachin Warrier, but does not provide information about TCS or its headquarters. 4. Context from 'Kanave Kalayathe': This context is the least relevant as it focuses on an album by Sachin Warrier and does not mention his employment or TCS.

Question:A Japanese manga series based on a 16 year old high school student Ichitaka Seto, is written and illustrated by someone born in what year?
golden idx: [4, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the context that directly mentions the manga series and the main character Ichitaka Seto. Context 4 is the most relevant as it talks about the manga "I"s" and the character Ichitaka Seto. Next, I will look for the context that mentions the illustrator of "I"s", which is context 6, as it provides the birth year of Masakazu Katsura, the illustrator of "I"s". The remaining contexts do not directly relate to the claim but will be ranked based on their relevance to manga series and their creators. Context 0 mentions a manga series with a similar sounding name (Seto no Hanayome), but it is not related to "I"s". Context 1 discusses a different manga series and its creator, which is informative but not directly related. Context 2 is about a mystery manga series, which is a different genre but still within the manga context. Context 3 talks about another unrelated manga series. Context 5 is about a manga series with a high school setting, which is somewhat relevant. Context 7 discusses a manga adaptation of the Bible, which is less relevant. Context 8 is about a sports manga, which is a different theme. Context 9 is about a supernatural detective manga, which is the least relevant to the claim.
idx: [4,6,0,1,2,5,7,8]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each one based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context idx 6: This context is about Masakazu Katsura, the author of the manga series in question. It provides his birth year, which directly answers the claim. 2. Context idx 4: This context discusses the manga series "I"s" and its main character, Ichitaka Seto. It is relevant because it is about the series and character mentioned in the claim, but it does not provide the birth year of the author. 3. Context idx 0: This context is about a different manga series and does not mention the author or the series in question, making it less relevant. 4. Context idx 1: Similar to idx 0, this context is about another manga series with no direct connection to the claim. 5. Context idx 2: This context is about "The Kindaichi Case Files," which is unrelated to the claim. 6. Context idx 5: This context is about "Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto," which is also unrelated to the claim. 7. Context idx 7: This context is about the "Manga Bible" series, which has no relevance to the claim. 8. Context idx 8: This context is about "The Prince of Tennis," which is unrelated to the claim.
idx: [6, 4, 0, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Masakazu Katsura" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Masakazu Katsura, the author of the manga series "I"s", and provides his birth year, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "I&quot;s" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it discusses the manga series "I"s" and its main character, Ichitaka Seto. It also mentions Masakazu Katsura as the author, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Silver Spoon (manga)" context: Although this context is about a different manga series, it is still relevant to the topic of Japanese manga and manga artists, which could be informative to the user. However, it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly mention "I"s" or Masakazu Katsura. 4. "My Bride is a Mermaid" context: This context is about a completely different manga series and author, making it the least relevant to the claim and unlikely to contain the answer.

Question:The battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi lost his life secured what for Ethiopia?
golden idx: [0, 5]
step-by-step think: The claim specifically asks about the battle where Giuseppe Arimondi died and what it secured for Ethiopia. The most relevant context would be the one that directly mentions Arimondi's death and its significance for Ethiopia. 1. "Battle of Adwa" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the battle where Arimondi died and states that it secured Ethiopian sovereignty. 2. "Giuseppe Arimondi" context: This context provides detailed information about Arimondi, including his death at Adwa, making it highly relevant. 3. "First Italo-Ethiopian War" context: This context is relevant as it covers the war during which the Battle of Adwa took place. 4. "Treaty of Addis Ababa" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the treaty that ended the war, which was a direct result of the Battle of Adwa. 5. "Outline of Ethiopia" context: This context provides a broad overview of Ethiopian history, including the Battle of Adwa. 6. "Ethiopia–Japan relations" context: This context mentions the Battle of Adwa in the broader context of Ethiopia's international relations. 7. "Second Battle of Agordat" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different battle in which Arimondi was involved. 8. "P'ent'ay" context: This context is the least relevant to the claim as it discusses religious demographics in Ethiopia and does not mention the Battle of Adwa or Arimondi.
idx: [5,0,7,8,2,3,9,1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Battle of Adwa" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the Battle of Adwa, where Giuseppe Arimondi died, and states that this battle secured Ethiopian sovereignty. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Giuseppe Arimondi" context: This context is directly related to Giuseppe Arimondi and mentions his death at the Battle of Adwa, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "First Italo-Ethiopian War" context: This context provides background on the war in which the Battle of Adwa was a decisive event, contributing to the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim. 4. "Treaty of Addis Ababa" context: This context discusses the treaty that formally ended the First Italo-Ethiopian War and recognizes Ethiopia's independence, which is a result of the Battle of Adwa where Arimondi died, thus relevant and likely to contain the answer. 5. "Outline of Ethiopia" context: While this context provides a broad overview of Ethiopian history, including the Battle of Adwa, it is less directly related to the claim compared to the contexts that focus specifically on the battle and the individuals involved. 6. "Ethiopia–Japan relations" context: This context mentions the Battle of Adwa in the context of Ethiopia's international relations, but it is less directly related to the claim than the contexts that focus on the battle itself. 7. "Second Battle of Agordat" context: This context mentions Arimondi and a battle he was involved in, but it is not the battle in question and therefore is less relevant to the claim. 8. "P'ent'ay" context: This context is about a religious term in Ethiopia and is not relevant to the claim about the Battle of Adwa or Giuseppe Arimondi.
idx: [5, 0, 7, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Battle of Adwa" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the Battle of Adwa, where Giuseppe Arimondi lost his life, and states that this battle secured Ethiopian sovereignty. It is informative and directly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Giuseppe Arimondi" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about Giuseppe Arimondi, including his death at the Battle of Adwa. However, it does not directly address the outcome of the battle for Ethiopia, making it slightly less relevant than the first context. 3. "Treaty of Addis Ababa" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the treaty that formally ended the First Italo-Ethiopian War and mentions the Battle of Adwa's role in securing Ethiopian independence. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim, but it is ranked lower because the answer is more indirect compared to the "Battle of Adwa" context. 4. "First Italo-Ethiopian War" context: While this context provides a broad overview of the war, it is less focused on the specific battle and its outcome for Ethiopia compared to the other contexts.

7. Context 8 discusses the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which involves a U.S. Vice President but is unrelated to the claim.

"Silene menziesii" context: While this context focuses on a specific species within the Silene genus, it is still highly relevant as it supports the claim by describing a particular plant species within the genus, thus confirming Silene as a type of plant. 4. "Silene conoidea" context: Similar to the previous context, this one provides specific information about another species within the Silene genus, further supporting the claim that Silene is a type of plant.
idx: [4, 1, 0, 2]

step-by-step think:1. "Ferocactus" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses half of the claim by describing the Ferocactus genus and confirming it is a type of plant. 2. "Silene" context: This context is equally relevant to the claim as it provides detailed information about the Silene genus, confirming it as a type of plant and addressing the other half of the claim. 3. "Silene menziesii" context: While this context focuses on a specific species within the Silene genus, it is still relevant because it supports the claim that Silene is a plant genus. It is less general than the context for Silene but still very informative. 4. "Silene conoidea" context: This context is also relevant as it describes another species within the Silene genus. However, it ranks lower because it is more specific and less likely to be sought after for the general claim in question.

golden idx: [5, 8]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. The most relevant context would be one that mentions a British jet-powered medium bomber and its use in the South West Pacific theatre during the specified time. 

1. Context idx 5: This context directly mentions the "English Electric Canberra," which is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 6: This context talks about the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, which is the location mentioned in the claim. It is relevant and may contain information about the bombers used in this theatre.
3. Context idx 1: This context provides information about the South West Pacific Area command, which is relevant to the theatre of operation mentioned in the claim.
4. Context idx 3: This context mentions No. 12 Squadron RAAF, which operated as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. It is relevant and may contain information about the bombers used.
5. Context idx 8: This context mentions No. 2 Squadron RAAF, which saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. It is relevant and may contain information about the bombers used.
6. Context idx 4: This context talks about the Coastwatchers, who played a significant role in the South West Pacific theatre. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain specific information about British bombers.
7. Context idx 7: This context discusses the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, which includes the South West Pacific Area. It is relevant but less likely to contain specific information about British bombers.
8. Context idx 2: This context is about Edwin A. Doss, an American fighter pilot. It is less relevant as it does not mention British bombers but is related to the South West Pacific theatre.

The remaining contexts (idx 0 and idx 9) are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention British bombers or the South West Pacific theatre during World War II.

idx: [5,6,1,3,8,4,7,2]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. 1. "English Electric Canberra" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the English Electric Canberra as a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. However, it states that it was introduced in 1951, which is after World War II, making it an unlikely candidate for the claim. 2. "No. 2 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the squadron's action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and its later use of English Electric Canberra jets. It is likely to contain the answer since it connects a bomber unit with the specified theatre. 3. "No. 12 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is relevant as it discusses a squadron that operated as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. It is informative and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "South West Pacific theatre of World War II" context: This context is relevant as it defines the South West Pacific theatre of World War II but does not mention specific aircraft, making it less likely to contain the answer. 5. "South West Pacific Area (command)" context: This context is informative about the command structure in the South West Pacific Theatre but does not mention specific aircraft. 6. "Coastwatchers" context: This context is relevant to the theatre but focuses on intelligence operations rather than bomber aircraft. 7. "Asiatic-Pacific Theater" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses the broader Pacific theatre and U.S. commands rather than British bombers. 8. "Edwin A. Doss" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on an American fighter pilot's service rather than British bombers.
idx: [3, 8, 6, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "No. 2 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the squadron's operations in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II and specifically notes that they were equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, which is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "No. 12 Squadron RAAF" context: This context is relevant because it discusses a squadron that operated as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. However, it does not specify the type of bombers used, making it slightly less likely to contain the answer compared to the "No. 2 Squadron RAAF" context. 3. "South West Pacific Area (command)" context: This context provides background information on the SWPA command and its operations area during World War II. While it is informative about the theatre of war, it does not specifically mention bomber units or aircraft types, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim than the previous contexts.

Question:Which year and which conference was the 14th season for this conference as part of the NCAA Division that the Colorado Buffaloes played in with a record of 2-6 in conference play?
golden idx: [1, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a specific year and conference related to the Colorado Buffaloes' 14th season in the NCAA Division with a 2-6 conference record. 1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 14th season for the Big 12, which is directly related to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: This context is relevant because it mentions the Colorado Buffaloes' football team with a 2-6 conference record, aligning with the claim's details. 3. Context idx 0: This context is about the 2014 Colorado Buffaloes football team, which is relevant but does not mention the 14th season or a 2-6 record. 4. Context idx 5: This context is about the 2015 Colorado Buffaloes football team and includes details about their conference play, which could be useful for the claim. 5. Context idx 8: This context is about the 2011 Colorado Buffaloes football team's first year in the Pac-12, which provides context about conference changes. 6. Context idx 9: This context is about the 2012 Colorado Buffaloes football team, providing additional information about their performance in the Pac-12. 7. Context idx 4: This context is about the 1989 Colorado Buffaloes football team, which is less relevant as it does not match the year or conference record sought in the claim. 8. Context idx 3: This context is about the 2014–15 Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball team, which is not relevant to the football claim.
idx: [1,7,0,5,8,9,4,3]

step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to find the context that mentions the 14th season of the conference as part of the NCAA Division in which the Colorado Buffaloes played with a record of 2-6 in conference play. 1. "2009 Big 12 Conference football season" context: This context is highly relevant as it specifies the 14th season for the Big 12, aligning with the claim's mention of the 14th season. It is part of the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season, which is the correct division mentioned in the claim. 2. "2009 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is directly relevant because it discusses the Colorado Buffaloes' 2009 season, where they had a record of 2-6 in Big 12 play, exactly matching the claim. 3. "2011 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is less relevant because it refers to the 2011 season and the team's record in Pac-12 play, which does not match the claim's details. 4. "2014 Colorado Buffaloes football team" context: This context is also less relevant because it refers to the 2014 season and the team's record in Pac-12 play, not the Big 12, and does not match the claim's specific details.
idx: [1, 7, 8, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 2009 Big 12 Conference football season being the 14th season, which aligns with the claim's request for the 14th season of a conference. It also specifies the year 2009, which is likely the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: This context is relevant because it discusses the 2009 Colorado Buffaloes football team and their record in Big 12 play, which is directly related to the claim. However, it does not mention that it was the 14th season for the conference. 3. Context idx 8: This context talks about the 2011 Colorado Buffaloes and their first year in the Pac-12 Conference, which is not relevant to the claim since it is looking for the 14th season in a conference and a specific record in conference play. 4. Context idx 0: This context is about the 2014 Colorado Buffaloes football team and their season record, but it does not mention the 14th season or the specific conference record asked in the claim, making it the least relevant.

Question:In 1991 Euromarché was bought by a chain that operated how any hypermarkets at the end of 2016?
golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is about the acquisition of Euromarché in 1991 by a chain and the number of hypermarkets that chain operated at the end of 2016. The context from 'Carrefour' is highly relevant as it mentions the number of hypermarkets Carrefour had at the end of 2016, which directly answers the claim. The 'Euromarché' context is also highly relevant because it confirms the acquisition by Carrefour in 1991. The other contexts do not mention Euromarché or Carrefour or the specific number of hypermarkets in 2016, making them less relevant. Therefore, they are ranked based on the likelihood of containing information related to hypermarkets or acquisitions, which might indirectly help answer the claim.

1. 'Carrefour' context: Directly relevant as it mentions Carrefour and the number of hypermarkets at the end of 2016.
2. 'Euromarché' context: Directly relevant as it mentions the acquisition by Carrefour in 1991.
3. 'Tesco Extra' context: Relevant as it mentions a chain of hypermarkets, but not directly related to the claim.
4. 'SavaCentre' context: Mentions a chain of hypermarkets and its ownership changes, which could be indirectly relevant.
5. 'Lewis's' context: Mentions a chain of department stores and acquisitions in 1991, which is somewhat relevant to the claim.
6. 'John A. Brown (department store)' context: Discusses a department store chain and ownership changes, slightly relevant.
7. 'Tazweed Center' context: Mentions a chain of hypermarkets but in a very different context (refugee camps), so it's less relevant.
8. 'Selver' context: Talks about a chain of supermarkets and hypermarkets but does not mention acquisitions or the specific year 2016.

The remaining contexts ('Uno-X' and 'Holiday Inn Lake Buena Vista Downtown') are not relevant to the claim as they do not discuss hypermarkets or the acquisition in question.

Question:who is younger Keith Bostic or Jerry Glanville ?
golden idx: [0, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Keith Bostic and Jerry Glanville, we need to compare their birth dates. Context 0 provides Keith Bostic's birth date as January 17, 1961. Context 7 provides Jerry Glanville's birth date as October 14, 1941. Based on this information, Keith Bostic is younger than Jerry Glanville. The contexts that directly provide the birth dates of the individuals in question are the most relevant and informative for answering the claim. Therefore, they should be ranked highest. The other contexts mention either Keith Bostic or Jerry Glanville but do not provide information pertinent to determining their ages, making them less relevant.

idx: [0,7,1,3,4,5,6,8]

step-by-step think: To determine who is younger between Keith Bostic or Jerry Glanville, we need to compare their birth dates. 1. "Keith Bostic (American football)" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the birth date of Keith Bostic, which is essential to answer the claim. 2. "Jerry Glanville" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides the birth date of Jerry Glanville, allowing for a direct comparison with Keith Bostic's age. 3. "1989 Houston Oilers season" context: This context mentions Jerry Glanville in relation to the Houston Oilers, but it does not provide information on his age or birth date. However, it is still somewhat relevant due to the mention of Glanville. 4. "1990 Atlanta Falcons season" context: This context also mentions Jerry Glanville and is relevant to the extent that it pertains to his career, but like the previous context, it does not provide information on his age or birth date. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not provide direct information about the birth dates of either individual, which is crucial for determining who is younger.
idx: [0,7,6,8]

step-by-step think:1. "Keith Bostic (American football)" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the birth date of Keith Bostic, which is essential to determine who is younger between him and Jerry Glanville. 2. "Jerry Glanville" context: This context is equally important because it provides the birth date of Jerry Glanville. Having the birth dates of both individuals allows us to compare and determine who is younger. 3. "1989 Houston Oilers season" context: This context mentions Jerry Glanville in relation to the Houston Oilers, but it does not provide information on his age or birth date, making it less relevant than the previous two contexts. 4. "1990 Atlanta Falcons season" context: This context also mentions Jerry Glanville but, like the previous one, does not provide information on his age or birth date. It is therefore the least relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [1, 4]
step-by-step think: To address the claim about the population of the city in which Kirton End is located according to the 2001 census, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Kirton End" context: This context is directly related to Kirton End and is the most likely to contain the specific information about the population of the city it is located in. 2. "Boston, Lincolnshire" context: Since Kirton End is in the Boston district of Lincolnshire, this context is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 3. "Kirton, Nottinghamshire" context: Although this context is about a different Kirton, it is still relevant due to the geographical proximity and similar naming, which might lead to confusion. 4. "Willoughton" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions Kirton Lindsey, which is close to Kirton End. 5. "Kirton, Suffolk" context: This context is about a different Kirton but is included due to the name similarity and potential relevance. 6. "Borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed" context: This context is about a different location but is included because it provides population data from the 2001 census, which could be informative. 7. "Sauce Viejo, Argentina" context: This context is less relevant as it pertains to a different country but is included for its census data. 8. "Parkridge, Saskatoon" context: This context is the least relevant but is included over others due to its mention of census data.

step-by-step think: 1. "Boston, Lincolnshire" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the town of Boston, which is the city in which Kirton End is located according to the first context. It also provides the population of the town at the 2001 census, directly answering the claim. 2. "Kirton End" context: This context is relevant because it establishes the location of Kirton End within the Boston district of Lincolnshire, which is necessary to identify the city in question. However, it does not provide population data. 3. "Willoughton" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions a different location in Lincolnshire and provides its population data, which is not directly related to the claim about Kirton End's city. 4. "Kirton, Suffolk" context: This context is informative about a different Kirton located in Suffolk, but it is not relevant to the claim regarding the population of the city in which Kirton End is located.
idx: [4,1,0,3]

step-by-step think: 1. "Boston, Lincolnshire" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the population of Boston at the 2001 census, which is likely the city in question since Kirton End is located in the Boston district. It provides specific figures for the population at the time of the 2001 census. 2. "Kirton End" context: This context is relevant because it describes the location of Kirton End and its proximity to Boston, confirming the relationship between Kirton End and the city of Boston. However, it does not provide population figures. 3. "Willoughton" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different location and its population figures from the 2001 census, which are not directly related to Kirton End or the city of Boston. 4. "Kirton, Suffolk" context: This context is the least relevant because it refers to a different Kirton located in Suffolk, not Lincolnshire, and provides population figures unrelated to the claim.

"Cypress" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly discusses the Cypress and its classification within the family Cupressaceae. 2. "Ajuga" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides information about the Ajuga genus, its species, and its family classification. 3.

"Ajugeae" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the tribe Ajugeae, which includes the genus Ajuga, providing further classification detail. 5. "Cedrol" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions the genera "Cupressus" and "Juniperus," which are related to the Cypress family, but it does not directly address the claim. 6. "Pilgerodendron" context: This context is relevant to the extent that it discusses a genus within the Cypress family, but it is not about Cypress or Ajuga genera specifically. 7. "Libocedrus" context: This context is informative about the Libocedrus genus in the Cypress family but less directly related to the claim. 8. "Fokienia" context: This context discusses the Fokienia genus, which is related to the Cypress family, but again, it is not directly about Cypress or Ajuga genera. The remaining contexts are not directly relevant to the claim and are therefore not included in the top 8.
idx: [0, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: To address the claim "Are both Cypress and Ajuga genera?" I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Ajuga" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Ajuga is a genus, directly answering part of the claim. 2. "Cypress" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses the Cypress family, which is directly related to the claim. 3.

"Cupressus" context: This context is informative as it discusses the genus Cupressus within the family Cupressaceae, which is related to the Cypress part of the claim. The remaining contexts are less directly related to the claim as they discuss other genera within the same families or related compounds, but do not directly confirm whether Cypress and Ajuga are genera.
idx: [2, 0, 5, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. "Ajuga" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Ajuga is a genus, directly addressing half of the claim. It provides detailed information about the Ajuga genus, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Cupressus" context: This context is relevant because it discusses the Cupressus genus, which is part of the Cypress family, thereby addressing the other half of the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Ajugeae" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions the Ajuga genus within the tribe Ajugeae, which could provide additional context to the claim. However, it is less directly related to the claim than the Ajuga and Cupressus contexts. 4. "Cypress" context: This context provides general information about cypress trees and shrubs, but it does not confirm whether Cypress is a genus, making it less relevant and less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the contexts that directly address the genera in question.

Context 5 mentions "Did You Ever See a Lassie?", another nursery rhyme, and provides its Roud Folk Song Index number. While it is informative, it is less directly related to the claim than Context 0. 4. Context 9 discusses "A Wise Old Owl," which is a different nursery rhyme with its own Roud Folk Song Index number. It is the least relevant to the claim as it does not pertain to the nursery rhyme inspiring "What Are Little Girls Made Of?".

Context 0 directly mentions "Yeah!" by Usher, which is the lead single from the album "Confessions," making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. Context 5 mentions "I Don't Wanna Know" by Mario Winans, which was stuck behind Usher's "Yeah" and "Burn" for eight consecutive weeks, making it the second most relevant context. Context 7 talks about "Stay" by Shakespears Sister, which was stuck at No. 1 for eight consecutive weeks, but it is not related to the album "Confessions." Context 4 discusses "Stay" by Sugarland, which was stuck behind Taylor Swift's "Our Song" for four weeks, not eight, and is less relevant to the claim.

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the singer of a song released as the lead single from the album "Confessions," which was stuck behind another popular song for eight consecutive weeks. 1. Context 0 ("Yeah! (Usher song)") is the most relevant as it directly mentions Usher's song "Yeah!" being the lead single from the album "Confessions." 2. Context 5 ("I Don't Wanna Know") is the second most relevant because it mentions that Mario Winans' song was stuck at number 2 behind Usher's singles "Yeah" and "Burn" for eight consecutive weeks. 3. Context 1 ("Billy Ray Cyrus discography") is informative but less relevant to the claim as it does not mention the album "Confessions" or the specific situation of being stuck behind for eight weeks. 4.

(Usher song)"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the song "Yeah!" by Usher, which was released as the lead single from the album "Confessions".

Question:Which of Tara Strong major voice role in animated series is an American animated television series based on the DC Comics fictional superhero team, the "Teen Titans"?
golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider how directly each context relates to the claim about Tara Strong's major voice role in "Teen Titans". The most relevant contexts will mention both Tara Strong and the "Teen Titans" series. 1. Context idx 0: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Tara Strong as a voice actor in the first season of "Teen Titans". 2. Context idx 2: This context is also highly relevant because it lists the main characters of "Teen Titans" and includes Tara Strong as the voice of Raven. 3. Context idx 4: Similar to idx 0, this context is about the fourth season of "Teen Titans" and mentions Tara Strong. 4. Context idx 6: This context is Tara Strong's filmography, which includes her role in "Teen Titans", making it relevant. 5. Context idx 1: This context talks about the "Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo" movie, which is related but less directly to Tara Strong's role in the series. 6. Context idx 5: This context is about "Teen Titans Go!", a spin-off of the original series where Tara Strong reprises her role, thus it's relevant. 7. Context idx 7: Similar to idx 5, this context is about "Teen Titans Go!" but is less informative about Tara Strong's role. 8. Context idx 8: This context provides background on the "Teen Titans" as a team, which is relevant but does not mention Tara Strong directly. 9. Context idx 3: This context is about Roy Harper, a character associated with the Teen Titans, but does not mention the animated series or Tara Strong, making it the least relevant.
idx: [0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 5, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a specific major voice role of Tara Strong in an animated series that is based on the "Teen Titans". Therefore, the contexts that directly mention Tara Strong's involvement with the "Teen Titans" series and her role as a voice actor in it are most relevant.
1. Context idx 2: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Tara Strong by name and identifies her as the voice of the dark sorceress Raven in the "Teen Titans" series. It provides detailed information about the series and its characters, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 6: This context lists Tara Strong's major voice roles and includes "Teen Titans" among them. It is informative and directly relevant to the claim, although it does not specify her role within the series.
3. Context idx 0: This context mentions Tara Strong as part of the main cast in the first season of "Teen Titans". It is relevant and likely to contain the answer, but it is less specific about her role compared to context idx 2.
4. Context idx 4: Similar to context idx 0, this context mentions Tara Strong in the context of the fourth season of "Teen Titans". It is relevant but does not provide specific information about her character.
The remaining contexts are less relevant because they either mention the "Teen Titans" series without specifying Tara Strong's role or are about related series like "Teen Titans Go!" which is not the primary focus of the claim.
idx: [2, 6, 0, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "List of Teen Titans episodes" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Teen Titans" and provides detailed information about the series, including Tara Strong's role as Raven. It directly answers the claim by confirming that "Teen Titans" is the series in question. 2. "Tara Strong filmography" context: This context is also relevant because it lists Tara Strong's major voice roles, including "Teen Titans." It confirms her involvement in the series but is slightly less informative regarding the specific claim about the series being American and based on the DC Comics team. 3. "Teen Titans (season 1)" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the first season of "Teen Titans" and mentions Tara Strong as part of the main cast. It is informative and supports the claim, but it is ranked lower because it is less comprehensive than the full list of episodes. 4. "Teen Titans (season 4)" context: Similar to the season 1 context, this context is relevant and informative about the fourth season of "Teen Titans." However, it is less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim compared to the contexts that provide an overview of the series or Tara Strong's filmography.

Since the claim asks under which former Governor of Arkansas Robert Suettinger served, this context is likely to contain the answer. 3.

It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. 4.

"National Intelligence Medal of Achievement" context: This context is informative about an award within the intelligence community but less directly related to the claim. 6. "National Intelligence Superior Service Medal" context: Similar to the previous context, this one discusses an award and is informative but not directly related to the claim. 7.

step-by-step think: The claim is asking under which former Governor of Arkansas Robert Suettinger served as the national intelligence officer. To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer.
1. Context idx 7: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Robert Suettinger's role as the national intelligence officer for East Asia and specifies that he served during Bill Clinton's presidency, who was a former Governor of Arkansas. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:In which year was the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours born?
golden idx: [4, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine the birth year of the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours, we need to find the context that directly mentions King George V, as he was the reigning monarch in 1925. Context 7 titled 'George V' provides the exact birth date of King George V, making it the most relevant and informative context for the claim. Context 4 titled '1925 Birthday Honours' is also highly relevant as it pertains directly to the honours created by King George V, although it does not mention his birth year. The other contexts are less relevant as they pertain to Birthday Honours of different years and are associated with different monarchs. However, they may still provide some background information on the tradition of Birthday Honours, which is tangentially related to the claim. Therefore, these will be ranked lower based on their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.
idx: [7, 4, 3, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6]

It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer. 4. Context idx 4: This context talks about another novel by Lourenço Mutarelli which was adapted into a film. It is relevant due to the author's connection but less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 5.

"Quando Eu Era Vivo" context: Similar to the "Drained" context, this context mentions another work by Lourenço Mutarelli, which is not directly related to the claim but shows his involvement in novel-based films. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not pertain to Lourenço Mutarelli or "Crime and Punishment".

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I'll consider their relevance to the claim about the American film actor and dancer who starred in the 1945 film "Johnny Angel". The context that directly mentions the film and the actor will be ranked highest. 1. "Johnny Angel" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly names the film "Johnny Angel" and mentions George Raft as the star, which answers the claim. 2. "George Raft" context: This context is highly relevant because it discusses George Raft's career as an actor and dancer, and although it doesn't mention "Johnny Angel" directly, it is closely related to the claim. 3. "Claudia Drake" context: This context mentions Claudia Drake's role in a film from the same year, "Detour", which could lead to confusion but is still relevant due to the time period. 4. "William D. Russell (director)" context: This context is about a director who started his Hollywood career in the same year as "Johnny Angel", but it does not mention the film directly. 5. "Shelley Fabares" context: This context mentions the song "Johnny Angel" and provides background on Shelley Fabares, which is tangentially related to the claim. 6. "Johnny Angel (song)" context: This context is about the song "Johnny Angel", which shares the name with the film but is otherwise unrelated to the claim. 7. "Johnny Lee Clary" context: This context mentions a person named Johnny Angel, but it is about a wrestler, not the actor from the film. 8. "Johnny Angel Wendell" context: This context is about a person with a similar name to the film's title but is unrelated to the claim. The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention the film or the actor in question.
idx: [3, 0, 2, 4, 9, 5, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Johnny Angel" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions the film "Johnny Angel" and lists the actors, including George Raft, who is the answer to the claim. 2. "George Raft" context: This context is about George Raft, the actor who starred in "Johnny Angel," providing information about his career and roles, which makes it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 3. "Claudia Drake" context: This context mentions Claudia Drake, an actress who starred in a different film noir from the same year, which might confuse users but is still somewhat relevant due to the genre and year. 4. "William D. Russell (director)" context: This context is about a director who started his Hollywood career in the same year as "Johnny Angel" was released, but it does not mention the film directly, making it less relevant than the others.

step-by-step think: 1. "Johnny Angel" context: This context is directly relevant to the claim as it mentions the film "Johnny Angel" and lists the main actors, including George Raft, who is the answer to the claim. It is highly informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "George Raft" context: This context is about George Raft, the actor in question. It provides detailed information about his career and roles, which makes it relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. However, it is ranked second as it does not directly mention the film "Johnny Angel". 3. "Claudia Drake" context: This context mentions Claudia Drake, an actress who starred in a different film noir from the same year, which could be misleading. It is less relevant than the first two contexts but more so than the last one, which does not mention the film or the actor in question. 4. "William D. Russell (director)" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not mention the film "Johnny Angel" or George Raft. It is about a director with no direct connection to the claim.

However, they are still informative about other playwrights' birth years. The ranking of these will be based on the informativeness of the context regarding playwrights and their birth years, as they might still be of interest in relation to the claim about a playwright's birth year.

"Bertha Runkle" context: This context is informative and provides the birth year of another playwright, which could be useful for comparison or elimination purposes. 5. "Michael Wynne (playwright)" context: This context provides the birth year of a different playwright, which is less relevant to the claim but still provides a birth year of a playwright. 6. "Sumie Tanaka" context: This context is about a Japanese screenwriter and playwright, which is less relevant since it does not pertain to the playwright of "Three Men on a Horse". 7. "Lenelle Moïse" context: This context is about a poet, actress, and playwright with no direct connection to the play in question. 8. "Finn Iunker" context: This context provides information about a Norwegian playwright, which is not relevant to the claim. 9.

This context is the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. Context 0 is the second most relevant as it mentions the 514th Flight Test Squadron and its location at Hill Air Force Base, but it does not provide information about Major Hill or the aircraft he was test-flying.

Context idx 5: Directly mentions dwellings built over three centuries, highly relevant and likely contains the answer. 2. Context idx 0: Refers to cliff-dwellings as "dwelling place of the dead," relevant but does not specify the time span. 3.

Context idx 3 and idx 6: Discuss synagogues, which are not directly related to the "dwelling place of the dead" but are old structures that could be metaphorically linked. 7. Context idx 2: Discusses inquilines, which is only tangentially related to the concept of a dwelling place. 8. Context idx 8: Refers to "heaven" in Judaism, which is a dwelling place but not specifically the "dwelling place of the dead" in the context of the claim.
idx: [5,0,4,9,1,7,3,6]

Context idx 5 - "Montezuma Castle National Monument": This context is highly relevant as it mentions the dwellings were built over the course of three centuries, which directly answers the claim. 2. Context idx 0 - "Flaming Feather": This context is relevant because it refers to the Montezuma Castle as the "dwelling place of the dead," which is directly related to the claim. 3. Context idx 4 - "Château de Druyes": This context is less relevant as it discusses a different location and time period, but it still mentions the concept of a dwelling place. 4. Context idx 9 - "Tabernacle": This context is informative and discusses a dwelling place, but it is related to a different culture and time period, making it less directly relevant to the claim.

step-by-step think:1. Context idx 5 - "Montezuma Castle National Monument": This context is highly relevant as it mentions the dwellings were built over the course of three centuries, which directly answers the claim regarding the time span of construction. 2. Context idx 0 - "Flaming Feather": This context is relevant because it refers to the Montezuma Castle as the "dwelling place of the dead," which is the phrase used in the claim. However, it does not provide a direct answer to the question of how many centuries the construction spanned. 3. Context idx 9 - "Tabernacle": This context is less directly relevant to the claim as it discusses a different "dwelling place" and its construction period, but it does mention a time span of 300 years, which could be misleading in relation to the claim. Context idx 4 - "Château de Druyes" is not relevant to the claim as it does not discuss the "dwelling place of the dead" nor a specific time span of construction.

Context 6 is the most relevant as it mentions Hunter Davies, who is the author of the novel, and provides his birth date, which is the direct answer to the claim. Context 2 is the second most relevant because it mentions the novel and the film based on it, which could lead to information about the author. Context 9 is relevant as it mentions Clive Donner, who directed the film adaptation of the novel, and could potentially contain information about the author. Context 0 mentions an actor who was in the film, which is less directly related but still relevant. Context 3 mentions another actor from the film, again less directly related but still relevant. Context 4 is about the song from the film, which is indirectly related to the novel and its author. Context 1 is about the nursery rhyme, which shares a title with the novel but is otherwise unrelated to the author. Context 7 is about a song that shares a tune with the nursery rhyme mentioned in Context 1, which makes it the least relevant to the claim. Context 5 is a disambiguation page and does not contain any substantive content, and Context 8 is about a different song entirely, making them both not relevant to the claim.

idx: [2, 6, 8, 9, 1, 3, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for a major truck road located in Backford Cross. 1. "Backford Cross" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Backford Cross and the A41/A5117 junction, indicating the presence of major roads in the area. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "A41 road" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the A41, a major trunk road that passes through Chester and Ellesmere Port, which are near Backford Cross. It may contain the answer to the claim. 3. "A5117 road" context: This context is also relevant as it describes the A5117 road, which intersects with the A41 at Backford Cross. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Strawberry Park, Cheshire" context: This context is less relevant as it only mentions the location of Strawberry Park in relation to Backford Cross but does not mention any major truck roads. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. The other contexts are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention Backford Cross or any roads associated with it.
idx: [2, 6, 8, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 2: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Backford Cross and the A41/A5117 junction, directly addressing the location in question and the major truck road. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 8: This context is also relevant because it describes the A5117 road, which intersects the A41 at Backford Cross. It provides specific details about the road's location and its connection to other major roads, making it likely to contain the answer. 3. Context idx 6: While this context talks about the A41 road and mentions several towns and cities it passes through, including Chester and Ellesmere Port, which are near Backford Cross, it is less directly related to Backford Cross itself compared to the other contexts. However, it is still informative and may contain the answer.

golden idx: [3, 9]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I first identify the context that directly answers the claim about Caroline Carver's role in a 1999 Hallmark movie. Context 3 mentions her as Princess Jessica in "The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns" (1999), which directly answers the question. Next, I look for contexts that mention the movie title or the year, which leads me to context 9 as it provides detailed information about the same movie. The remaining contexts are ranked based on their relevance to Hallmark Entertainment movies around the same period or mentioning Caroline Carver, even if not directly related to the 1999 movie. Contexts that are less relevant or about different topics are ranked lower.

It is less relevant and less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4.

It also establishes her as an actress, which supports the likelihood of her starring in a film. 3. "Bottom of the World (film)" context: This context is relevant because it mentions a 2017 film starring Douglas Smith, which partially matches the claim. However, it does not mention Cressida Bonas or Lucien Laviscount, making it less likely to contain the answer. 4.

idx: [2,4,8,9,1,0,5,3]

step-by-step think: To determine the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, I will analyze each context based on its content:
1. Context idx 2 ("Casino, New South Wales"): This context mentions Casino being on the banks of the Richmond River and its location relative to the Bruxner Highway, which is highly relevant to the claim.
2. Context idx 8 ("Mummulgum"): This context provides information about Mummulgum's location on the Bruxner Highway and its proximity to Casino, but does not mention the river, making it less relevant than idx 2.

6. Context idx 0, 5, and 3: These contexts mention locations on the Bruxner Highway but do not provide information about any river, making them the least relevant to the claim.

However, it does not mention Mummulgum directly. 3. "Mummulgum" context: This context is relevant as it describes Mummulgum's location in relation to Casino and the Bruxner Highway, but it does not mention the river, making it slightly less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Tabulam" context: This context mentions Tabulam's location on the Bruxner Highway and the Clarence River, but since the claim is about Mummulgum, it is less relevant than the other contexts.

"Bubblegum Alley" context: This context is the most relevant as it directly describes Bubblegum Alley and its location in San Luis Obispo, California. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Gum Wall" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the Gum Wall, which is similar to Bubblegum Alley, and it also mentions the location of Bubblegum Alley in the text. 3. "San Luis Obispo, California" context: This context is relevant as it provides information about the city where Bubblegum Alley is located. 4. "Ouch! (gum)" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it discusses bubble gum, which is related to the topic of Bubblegum Alley, but it is less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim. 5. "Digital Media Factory" context: This context is slightly relevant due to the mention of a location in California and a connection to gum through the Wrigley Gum manufacturing facility. 6. "Hollywood Star Lanes" context: This context is not directly relevant to Bubblegum Alley but is included because it mentions a location in California. 7. "Up Your Alley Fair" context: This context is not directly relevant to the claim but is included due to the mention of an alley in California. 8. "Lower Louviers and Chicken Alley" context: This context is the least relevant as it mentions an alley but is located in Delaware, not California.
idx: [9, 5, 7, 1, 8, 0, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Bubblegum Alley" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly describes Bubblegum Alley and its location in San Luis Obispo, California, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "San Luis Obispo, California" context: This context is relevant because it provides information about the city where Bubblegum Alley is located, which could be useful for someone looking for the alley's location. 3. "Gum Wall" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions Bubblegum Alley in comparison to the Gum Wall, indicating a similarity and providing context for the claim. 4. "Digital Media Factory" context: This context is less relevant but still scores because it mentions a location in California and involves gum, albeit in a historical context of the Wrigley Gum manufacturing facility.
idx: [9, 7, 5, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Bubblegum Alley" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the claim, providing specific information about the location of Bubblegum Alley in San Luis Obispo, California. It is very informative and certainly contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Gum Wall" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Bubblegum Alley and compares it to the Gum Wall, indicating a similarity and reinforcing the location in San Luis Obispo, California. It is less informative than the first context but still likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "San Luis Obispo, California" context: While this context provides general information about the city of San Luis Obispo, it does not directly mention Bubblegum Alley. However, it is somewhat relevant because it gives background information about the city where Bubblegum Alley is located. It may not contain the direct answer but is related to the claim.

Question:At what venue was the January 2, 2012 game featured the University of Louisville team?
golden idx: [1, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the venue of the game on January 2, 2012, featuring the University of Louisville team. 1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the 2013 Sugar Bowl, which took place on January 2, 2013, and featured the Louisville Cardinals. It is likely to contain the answer because it discusses a game involving the University of Louisville team, even though the year does not match. 2. Context idx 9: This context is directly relevant as it discusses the 2012 Louisville Cardinals football team and their games. It is likely to contain the answer because it mentions the team's season and bowl game. 3. Context idx 7: This context is relevant because it mentions Parkway Field, a venue associated with the University of Louisville team, although it refers to a time period before 2012. 4. Context idx 3: This context is less relevant because it discusses the 2008 Fiesta Bowl, which does not involve the University of Louisville team but is a college football bowl game that could be similar in nature to the one in question. 5. Context idx 4: This context is less relevant because it discusses the 1989 Fiesta Bowl, which does not involve the University of Louisville team. 6. Context idx 5: This context is less relevant because it discusses the 1989 Cotton Bowl Classic, which does not involve the University of Louisville team. 7. Context idx 0 and 2: These contexts are not relevant because they discuss basketball tournaments from 1943 and 1956, which are not related to the claim. 8. Context idx 6: This context is not relevant because it discusses a video game and has no connection to the claim. 9. Context idx 8: This context is not relevant because it discusses the NBL Canada All-Stars, which is unrelated to the claim about the University of Louisville team.
idx: [1, 9, 7, 3, 4, 5, 0, 2]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the venue of the game on January 2, 2012, featuring the University of Louisville team. 1. Context idx 9: This context mentions the 2012 Louisville Cardinals football team and their participation in the Sugar Bowl, which is likely the game in question. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer. 2. Context idx 1: This context talks about the 2013 Sugar Bowl, which is not the correct year, but it mentions the venue for the Sugar Bowl games, which could be the same venue as the 2012 game. It is relevant and may contain the answer. 3. Context idx 7: This context discusses Parkway Field, a venue associated with the University of Louisville team, but it states that they moved to Cardinal Stadium in 1998, so it is less likely to be the venue for the 2012 game. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer. 4. Context idx 3: This context is about the 2008 Fiesta Bowl, which is not related to the 2012 game or the University of Louisville team. It is not relevant to the claim. The other contexts are about different games, years, or teams and are not relevant to the claim.
idx: [9, 1, 7, 3]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 1: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Sugar Bowl game on January 2, 2013, which is close to the claim's date and involves the University of Louisville team. It specifies the Mercedes-Benz Superdome as the venue, making it likely to contain the answer. 2. Context idx 9: This context talks about the 2012 Louisville Cardinals football team and mentions Papa John's Cardinal Stadium as their home venue. It is relevant because it discusses the team in question, but it does not mention the specific game date from the claim. 3. Context idx 7: This context mentions Parkway Field as a venue related to the University of Louisville team but indicates that they moved to Cardinal Stadium in 1998, which makes it less likely to be the venue for a 2012 game. 4. Context idx 3: This context is about the 2008 Fiesta Bowl, which is not relevant to the claim as it does not involve the University of Louisville team or the specific date in question.

Question:Which film was Oscar nominated, LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton or Gimme Shelter, the 1970 Rolling Stones documentary?
golden idx: [2, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim asks which film was Oscar-nominated between "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" and "Gimme Shelter," the 1970 Rolling Stones documentary. To rank the contexts, I will prioritize those that directly mention an Oscar nomination or provide information about the films in question.
1. Context 2: Directly states that "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 74th Academy Awards, which directly answers the claim.
2. Context 9: Provides information about the "Gimme Shelter" documentary, including its directors and the event it chronicles, but does not mention an Oscar nomination, making it relevant but less so than context 2.
3. Context 0: Mentions the "Gimme Shelter" documentary as it includes audio samples from it, making it somewhat relevant.
4. Context 4: Talks about the cameraman for the "Gimme Shelter" documentary, which is related but does not discuss Oscar nominations.
5. Context 1: Mentions Merry Clayton's involvement with the song "Gimme Shelter" and her feature in an Oscar-winning documentary, but this is a different documentary and not directly related to the claim.
6. Context 3: Discusses a compilation album named "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones, which is less relevant to the claim.
7. Context 6: Describes the song "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones, which is the least relevant to the Oscar nomination claim.
8. Context 7: Talks about Keith Richards and his involvement with The Rolling Stones and the song "Gimme Shelter," which is not directly related to the claim about Oscar nominations.
The remaining contexts (5 and 8) are not relevant to the claim as they do not provide information about the films or Oscar nominations.

idx: [2, 9, 0, 4, 1, 3, 6, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly confirms the Oscar nomination for the documentary, answering the claim. 2. "Gimme Shelter (1970 film)" context: This context is about the "Gimme Shelter" documentary but does not mention an Oscar nomination, making it less relevant than the first context. 3. "Merry Clayton" context: This context mentions "Gimme Shelter" and an Oscar-winning documentary, but it refers to a different film, "20 Feet from Stardom," which could cause confusion. 4. "Baird Bryant" context: This context provides information on the "Gimme Shelter" documentary and its historical significance, which is relevant but not directly answering the Oscar-related claim.
idx: [2, 9, 1, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly confirms the film's Oscar nomination for Best Documentary Feature, which is the specific information requested in the claim. 2. "Gimme Shelter (1970 film)" context: While this context provides detailed information about the "Gimme Shelter" film, it does not mention an Oscar nomination, making it less relevant to the claim compared to the context about "LaLee's Kin." 3. "Merry Clayton" context: This context mentions Merry Clayton's association with the song "Gimme Shelter" and her feature in an Oscar-winning documentary, but it does not provide information about the film "Gimme Shelter" being Oscar-nominated, thus it is less relevant to the claim. 4. "Baird Bryant" context: This context provides information about Baird Bryant's involvement in the "Gimme Shelter" film, but like the previous context, it does not address the Oscar nomination aspect of the claim, making it the least relevant.

Question:Which board game was published most recently, Pirate's Cove or Catan?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: To determine which board game was published most recently, we need to look at the publication dates mentioned in the contexts. Context 6 mentions "The Rivals for Catan" was released in 2010, which is the most recent date mentioned for a Catan game. Context 5 mentions "Pirate's Cove" was originally published in 2002 and republished in 2003. Therefore, "The Rivals for Catan" is the most recently published game between the two. The other contexts mention various Catan-related games and expansions, but none provide a more recent publication date than 2010. Thus, context 6 is the most relevant and informative for answering the claim. The next most relevant contexts are those related to Catan, as they provide background information that could be useful for understanding the series and its timeline. Context 5 is also relevant as it provides the publication date for "Pirate's Cove". The remaining contexts are ranked based on their relevance to the Catan series and the likelihood of containing information about the publication dates.
idx: [6, 5, 3, 2, 1, 7, 8, 0]

step-by-step think: To determine which board game was published most recently, Pirate's Cove or Catan, I will analyze the contexts for publication dates. 1. "Pirate's Cove" context: This context mentions that Pirate's Cove was originally published in 2002 and republished in 2003. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "The Rivals for Catan" context: This context talks about a game released in 2010, which is part of the "Catan" series. Although it is not the original "Catan" game, it is still relevant because it provides a more recent publication date related to the "Catan" series. 3. "Catan Dice Game" context: This context discusses a game published in 2007, which is also part of the "Catan" series. It is relevant and provides a publication date that is more recent than Pirate's Cove. 4. "Catan" context: This context provides the original publication date of "The Settlers of Catan" in 1995, which is less recent than the other contexts mentioned. However, it is still relevant to the claim. The other contexts are about different expansions or versions of the "Catan" series and do not provide direct information about the original "Catan" game's publication date, making them less relevant to the claim.
idx: [5,6,2,3]

step-by-step think: To determine which board game was published most recently, we need to compare the publication years mentioned in the contexts. 1. "The Rivals for Catan" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the game was released in 2010, which is the most recent date among the provided contexts. 2. "Catan Dice Game" context: This context is also relevant because it provides a publication date of 2007, which is more recent than "Pirate's Cove" but not as recent as "The Rivals for Catan". 3. "Pirate's Cove" context: This context is relevant as it provides a publication date of 2002, which is the earliest among the contexts. The "Catan" context is not included in the top 3 because it refers to the original game published in 1995, which is not directly relevant to the claim about the most recently published game.

Context idx 0: This context talks about the "Tomb Raider" video game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix, which is highly relevant as it mentions the developers and publishers. 3. Context idx 7: This context provides information about the "Tomb Raider" franchise and its ownership, which is relevant to the claim. 4. Context idx 1: This context gives a broad overview of the "Tomb Raider" media franchise, including games and movies, which is informative. 5.

Context idx 5: This context provides background on Lara Croft as a character within the Square Enix franchise, which is useful but not directly about the voice actor. 7. Context idx 8: This context talks about "Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris," another game in the franchise, which is relevant but not directly answering the claim. 8. Context idx 3: This context is about "Tomb Raider III," developed by Core Design, which is less relevant since the claim is likely about the more recent games.
idx: [6,0,7,1,2,5,8,3]

Context idx 0: This context is highly relevant as it mentions "Tomb Raider" being developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix, directly answering the claim about the company that developed the game for which Alice David voiced Lara Croft. 2.

idx: [0, 6, 7, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim is about identifying the company that developed the video game in which Alice David voiced Lara Croft. 1. Context 0 is highly relevant as it mentions "Tomb Raider" being developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix, directly addressing the claim. 2. Context 6 is also relevant because it confirms Alice David as the voice of Lara Croft in the French dub of the game, linking the actress to the "Tomb Raider" game mentioned in Context 0. 3. Context 7 provides background on the "Tomb Raider" franchise and its ownership history, which is useful but less directly related to the claim than Contexts 0 and 6. 4. Context 1 offers a broad overview of the "Tomb Raider" media franchise and its development history, which is informative but does not directly answer the claim about the specific video game Alice David voiced.

Context 2 mentions "The Monster" which is a song from Eminem's album "The Marshall Mathers LP 2" featuring Rihanna, who has an album titled "Unapologetic". This context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. Context 4 also mentions Rihanna's album "Unapologetic" and her collaboration with Eminem, making it the second most relevant.

Contexts 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not mention Eminem, the singer, or the album "Unapologetic" and are therefore not relevant to the claim.

Question:The 1974 Texas Tech Raiders football team represented what public research university in Lubbock, Texas?
golden idx: [5, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim specifically asks about the 1974 Texas Tech Raiders football team and the public research university they represented in Lubbock, Texas. Therefore, the context that directly mentions the 1974 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team would be the most relevant and likely to contain the answer. 1. Context idx 5: This context is the most relevant as it directly addresses the 1974 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and mentions Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. 2. Context idx 9: This context is about Texas Tech University, providing information about the institution they represented. 3. Context idx 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7: These contexts mention the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team in different years, which are relevant but not as specific to the 1974 team as context idx 5. They are ranked next as they still pertain to the football team and the university. 4. Context idx 6: This context is about the 1986 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team, which is less relevant than the other football team contexts but still mentions the university. 5. Context idx 8: This context discusses the Texas A&M–Texas Tech football rivalry, which is relevant to Texas Tech football history but less likely to contain specific information about the 1974 team.
idx: [5,9,0,1,2,3,4,7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the 1974 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and states that they represented Texas Tech University, which answers the claim. 2. Context idx 9: This context is about Texas Tech University and provides information on its establishment and location, which is relevant to the claim. 3. Context idx 0: This context mentions the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and provides details about their season, which is somewhat relevant but less so than the direct mention of the 1974 team. 4. Context idx 7: This context also mentions the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and details about a specific season, which is relevant but not as directly related to the 1974 team as context idx 5.
idx: [5, 9, 0, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 5: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the 1974 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and provides detailed information about their season, including the representation of Texas Tech University. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 9: This context is about Texas Tech University and mentions that it is a public research university in Lubbock, Texas, which is the answer to the claim. It is relevant and informative. 3. Context idx 0: This context mentions the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team and provides information about their 2014 season. While it is not about the 1974 team, it is still relevant as it pertains to the same university's football team. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts but is more relevant than the other context provided.

golden idx: [6, 9]
step-by-step think: To address the claim regarding the Siege of Bharatpur and the commanders involved, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the siege, the commanders, and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "Siege of Bharatpur" context: This context is directly related to the Siege of Bharatpur and mentions a British commander, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 2.

"Siege of Bharatpur (1805)" context: This context discusses the 1805 siege and mentions General Gerard Lake, relevant to the claim. 5. "Commander-in-Chief, India" context: It provides information on the role of the Commander-in-Chief, India, which is pertinent to the claim but does not mention specific individuals or events related to the siege. 6. "Claude Auchinleck" context: Auchinleck was a Commander-in-Chief of India, but his tenure was much later than the siege, making this context less relevant. 7. "Bharatpur, Rajasthan" context: This context provides general information about Bharatpur but does not directly address the siege or commanders. 8. "Maharaja Surajmal Brij University, Bharatpur" context: This context is named after a key figure related to Bharatpur but does not discuss the siege or commanders.

Context idx 0: This context talks about Lohagarh Fort and its defense against British forces, which is relevant to the claim but does not mention the specific siege or commanders involved.
idx: [9, 6, 5, 0]

step-by-step think: 1.

It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context from 'Siege of Bharatpur': This context is relevant because it describes the siege and mentions that British troops under Lord Combermere captured the fortress, aligning with the claim's focus on the storming of the castle. 3. Context from 'Lohagarh Fort': This context is less directly related to the claim since it discusses the fort's history and its defense against British forces in 1805, which is not the event in question but provides background information on the location relevant to the claim.

idx: [7, 6, 8, 9, 2, 3, 5, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Rankin/Bass Productions" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly discusses the production company in question and details its specialization in stop motion animation, which is likely the answer to the claim. 2. "The Year Without a Santa Claus" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the specific work produced by Rankin/Bass and could provide insight into the type of work they are known for. 3.

The other contexts are not directly related to the production company or the type of work it is known for, hence they are not included in the top 4.
idx: [6, 7, 8, 9]

step-by-step think:1. "Rankin/Bass Productions" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to the production company in question and details its specialization in seasonal television specials and stop motion animation, which is likely the type of work the claim is referring to. 2.

"A Miser Brothers' Christmas" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses a spin-off of "The Year Without a Santa Claus" and mentions the animation style of Rankin/Bass, but it is less directly related to the claim than the previous contexts. 4. "The Year Without a Santa Claus (2006 film)" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a live-action remake, which is a different type of work than what Rankin/Bass is best known for, according to the claim.

Context idx 9: This context discusses "Mystery Girl," a TV movie from "The Naked Brothers Band" series. It is relevant but less likely to contain the answer about the film year. 8. Context idx 0: This context is about the soundtrack for "The Naked Brothers Band" movie, which is less relevant to the claim about a film starring the composer. The remaining contexts are about albums and do not directly relate to the film claim.
idx: [5,7,4,6,1,3,9,0]

step-by-step think: To address the claim about the film that starred the composer for "The Naked Brothers Band," I will rank the contexts based on their relevance and likelihood of containing the answer. 1. Context idx 7 ("Nat Wolff"): This context is highly relevant as it mentions Nat Wolff, who composed the music for "The Naked Brothers Band" and is likely to have starred in the film in question. 2. Context idx 5 ("The Fault in Our Stars (film)"): This context is relevant because it mentions a film starring Nat Wolff, which could be the film the claim is referring to. 3.

However, it does not directly provide the year of the film. 3. "Nat and Alex Wolff" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses the work of Nat Wolff and his brother, including their music and acting careers. It is less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim but still provides useful background information. 4. "Alex Wolff" context: This context is informative about Alex Wolff, Nat's brother, and mentions their work together. However, it is the least relevant to the claim as it does not mention Nat Wolff's acting roles outside of "The Naked Brothers Band".

Question:The author of Sexual Politics attended which British University?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the British University that the author of "Sexual Politics" attended. Context 9 directly answers the claim by stating that Kate Millett, the author of "Sexual Politics," attended Oxford University and studied at St Hilda's College, Oxford. This context is highly relevant and informative. Context 0 mentions "Sexual Politics" and its author, Kate Millett, but does not mention the university she attended. However, it is still relevant due to the direct mention of the book and author. Context 1 discusses a novel that deals with themes of sexual politics, but it does not mention Kate Millett or her education, making it less relevant. Context 2 talks about a band that has songs related to sexual politics, but again, it does not mention Kate Millett or her education. Context 3 is about a Malayalam-language novelist and does not seem relevant to the claim. Context 4 mentions Susie Bright, who is associated with sexual politics, but does not provide information about Kate Millett's education. Context 5 discusses Carol J. Adams and her work related to sexual politics, but it does not mention Kate Millett or her education. Context 6 is about Harris G. Mirkin and his work on sexual politics, but it does not mention Kate Millett or her education. Context 7 discusses Shannon Bell and her teachings on sexual politics, but it does not mention Kate Millett or her education. Context 8 is about the British University Hurling Championship and is not relevant to the claim.
idx: [9, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]

step-by-step think: 1. Context with index 9 is the most relevant as it directly mentions Kate Millett, the author of "Sexual Politics," and states that she attended Oxford University. It provides comprehensive information about her education and work, making it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context with index 0 is relevant because it mentions the book "Sexual Politics," but it does not provide information about the author's education. 3. Context with index 4 is somewhat relevant as it discusses Susie Bright, who is associated with sexual politics, but it does not provide information about Kate Millett's education. 4. Context with index 5 discusses Carol J. Adams and her work related to sexual politics, which is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer about Kate Millett's education. The remaining contexts are less relevant as they do not pertain directly to Kate Millett or her education.
idx: [9, 0, 4, 5]

step-by-step think: 1. "Kate Millett" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Kate Millett, the author of "Sexual Politics," and provides information about her attending Oxford University, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Sexual Politics" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the book "Sexual Politics," but it does not provide information about the university Kate Millett attended, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Susie Bright" and "Carol J. Adams" contexts: These contexts are less relevant as they do not mention Kate Millett's education or the book "Sexual Politics." They are about different authors and their works on sexual politics and are unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:Who had the best singles ranking, Roberta Vinci or Jorge Lozano?
golden idx: [0, 2]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for a comparison of the best singles rankings between Roberta Vinci and Jorge Lozano. Context 2 directly addresses Roberta Vinci's highest singles ranking as World No. 7. Context 0 provides Jorge Lozano's highest singles ranking as World No. 51. These two contexts are the most relevant and informative regarding the claim. Contexts 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 mention either Roberta Vinci or Jorge Lozano but do not provide information about their singles rankings, making them less relevant to the claim. However, they are still more relevant than context 5, which is about a band unrelated to the tennis players in question.
idx: [2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: To determine the best singles ranking between Roberta Vinci and Jorge Lozano, I will consider the contexts that provide specific information about their highest singles rankings. 1. "Roberta Vinci" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Roberta Vinci's career-high singles ranking of World No. 7, directly answering the claim. 2. "Jorge Lozano" context: This context is also highly relevant because it states Jorge Lozano's highest singles ranking as World No. 51, which is necessary to answer the claim. 3. "Marta Domachowska" context: This context mentions Roberta Vinci in the context of doubles, but it also refers to singles rankings, making it somewhat relevant. 4. "1988 Volvo International – Doubles" context: This context mentions Jorge Lozano and a significant win, which could indirectly suggest his skill level in singles, even though it's focused on doubles. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not provide direct information about the singles rankings of the players in question.
idx: [2, 0, 4, 8]

step-by-step think:1. "Roberta Vinci" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides specific information about Roberta Vinci's highest singles ranking, which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and contains the exact answer to the claim. 2. "Jorge Lozano" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions Jorge Lozano's highest singles ranking. Although his ranking is not as high as Vinci's, the context is directly related to the claim and informative. 3. "1988 Volvo International – Doubles" context: This context is less relevant as it focuses on a doubles event and does not provide information about singles rankings. However, it is related to Jorge Lozano, one of the individuals in question. 4. "Marta Domachowska" context: This context is the least relevant as it does not provide information about the singles rankings of either Vinci or Lozano. It mentions Domachowska's own ranking and her association with Vinci in doubles, but that does not contribute to answering the claim.

"Discovery Institute" context: This context is also highly relevant because it describes the Discovery Institute's advocacy of the "Teach the Controversy" campaign, which is directly related to the claim. 3. "Truth Initiative" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions the Truth Initiative's campaign against tobacco, but it is not the campaign in question. 4. "Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)" context: Similar to the previous context, it talks about a campaign but not the one that is being asked about in the claim. 5. "Discovery Museum and Planetarium" context: This context is less relevant because it does not mention any campaign embraced by both organizations. 6. "Discovery Networks Benelux" context: This context is also less relevant as it does not mention any specific campaign related to the claim. 7. "Every Voice" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different campaign related to political advocacy. 8. "Extrema (band)" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about a band and not a campaign. 9. "The Last Embrace" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about a music release and not a campaign. 10. "I Am... Gabriel" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it is about a movie plot and not a campaign.
idx: [6,8,7,5,0,2,3,1]

step-by-step think: The claim asks about the campaign that both Truth in Science and Discovery embrace. 1. "Truth in Science" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the "Teach the Controversy" campaign, which is directly related to the claim. It also establishes the connection between Truth in Science and the Discovery Institute, making it very likely to contain the answer. 2. "Discovery Institute" context: This context is also highly relevant because it describes the Discovery Institute's advocacy of the "Teach the Controversy" campaign, which is the campaign in question. 3. "Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)" context: This context is less relevant because it discusses a different "truth" campaign related to anti-tobacco efforts, not the campaign shared by Truth in Science and Discovery. 4. "Truth Initiative" context: This context is informative but not relevant to the claim as it pertains to a tobacco control organization and its campaigns, which are unrelated to the "Teach the Controversy" campaign. The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim as they discuss unrelated organizations or topics.
idx: [6, 8, 5, 7]

step-by-step think:1. "Truth in Science" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the "Teach the Controversy" campaign and its association with both Truth in Science and the Discovery Institute. It provides detailed information about the campaign and the organizations' efforts to promote it, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Discovery Institute" context: This context is also highly relevant because it describes the Discovery Institute's involvement with the "Teach the Controversy" campaign. It offers insight into the institute's goals and strategies, which are directly related to the claim. 3. "Truth Initiative" context: While this context is informative, it is about a different "Truth" campaign related to anti-tobacco efforts and does not mention the "Teach the Controversy" campaign. Therefore, it is less relevant and less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)" context: Similar to the "Truth Initiative," this context discusses an anti-tobacco campaign, which is not related to the claim about the "Teach the Controversy" campaign embraced by Truth in Science and Discovery.

idx: [2, 7, 4, 0, 6, 1, 5, 3]

step-by-step think: To address the claim about which musician was incarcerated, impacting his career with a rock band, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer:

It is informative and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Lostprophets" context: This context is relevant because it gives background information about the rock band Lostprophets, which Ian Watkins was a part of. It is less informative regarding the claim but still relevant. 3. "We Bring an Arsenal" context: This context mentions the impact of Watkins's imprisonment on the band's single release, which is relevant to the claim but less direct than the previous contexts. It is informative in terms of the consequences of his incarceration. 4. "Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja" context: This context provides information about a song by Lostprophets and mentions Ian Watkins as the writer. It is the least relevant to the claim as it does not discuss his incarceration or its impact on his career.

Question:The movies Queen of Blood and Battle Beyond the Sun both contained scenes from what 1959 Soviet feature?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim is looking for a 1959 Soviet feature that both "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun" used scenes from. 1. "Nebo Zovyot" context: This is the most relevant context as it directly mentions "Nebo Zovyot", the 1959 Soviet science fiction film from which "Battle Beyond the Sun" is derived. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Mechte Navstrechu" context: This context is relevant because "Queen of Blood" is based on the screenplay for "Mechte Navstrechu", another Soviet film that could be the one in question. 3. "Girl Seeks Father" context: This context mentions a 1959 Soviet drama film, which makes it potentially relevant, but less so than the first two contexts. 4. "I Was a Satellite of the Sun" context: This context is about a 1959 Soviet science-fiction film, which could be related to the claim but is less likely than the top two contexts. 5. "Older Sister" context: This context is about a Soviet feature film, but from 1966, making it less relevant. 6.

"When Harry Met Sally... (soundtrack)" context: This context is also highly relevant because it pertains to the soundtrack of the movie and mentions Harry Connick Jr. winning a Grammy for his performance. 3. "When Harry Met Sally..." context: This context is relevant as it discusses the movie itself, which the soundtrack is a part of, but it does not mention the soundtrack or the number of top 20 albums. 4. "Nora Ephron" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions Nora Ephron, the writer of the movie, and the movie itself, but it does not provide information about the soundtrack or the albums. 5. "Sunset Las Palmas Studios" context: This context is less relevant as it only mentions the movie in the context of the production lot where it was filmed. 6. "Bruno Kirby" context: This context is less relevant because it mentions the actor and the movie but not the soundtrack or albums. 7. "Meg Ryan" context: This context is less relevant because it focuses on the actress and her role in the movie, without mentioning the soundtrack or albums. 8. "Connie Sawyer" context: This context is the least relevant as it only briefly mentions the movie among other works of the actress. 9. "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different movie that was inspired by "When Harry Met Sally...". 10. "Golden Gate University School of Law" context: This context is not relevant to the claim at all as it discusses a law school with no connection to the movie or the soundtrack.

Question:Are Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya both orchids?
golden idx: [0, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim asks whether Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya are both orchids. To rank the contexts, I will consider how directly each context relates to the claim and the likelihood it contains the answer. 1. "Broughtonia" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Broughtonia is a genus of orchids. 2. "Laeliocattleya" context: This context is equally relevant because it identifies Laeliocattleya as a nothogenus of orchid hybrids. 3. "Broughtonia sanguinea" context: While this context focuses on a specific species within the Broughtonia genus, it supports the claim by associating Broughtonia with orchids. 4. "Hawkinsara" context: This context is informative as it mentions Broughtonia as one of the parent genera of the Hawkinsara hybrid, linking it to orchids. 5. "Cattleytonia" context: This context is relevant because it is an intergeneric hybrid involving Broughtonia and suggests a connection to orchids. 6. "Otaara" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it lists Broughtonia among the parent genera of the Otaara hybrid, which implies a relation to orchids. 7. "Caladenia" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different genus of orchids, but it is informative about the orchid family in general. 8. "Paracaleana" context: This context is the least relevant to the claim as it discusses a different genus of orchids without any direct connection to Broughtonia or Laeliocattleya.
idx: [0,9,6,4,1,8,7,2]

step-by-step think: 1. "Broughtonia" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Broughtonia is a genus of orchids, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Laeliocattleya" context: This context is equally relevant because it establishes that Laeliocattleya is a nothogenus of orchid hybrids, addressing the other half of the claim. 3. "Broughtonia sanguinea" context: While this context focuses on a specific species within the Broughtonia genus, it supports the claim by further confirming that Broughtonia is part of the Orchidaceae family. 4. "Hawkinsara" context: This context is relevant as it mentions both Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya, indicating a connection to the claim through their inclusion in the Hawkinsara hybrid. The remaining contexts are less directly related to the claim as they either discuss other genera or hybrids that do not focus on the Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya genera.
idx: [0, 9, 6, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Broughtonia" context: This context is highly relevant as it confirms that Broughtonia is a genus of orchids, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Laeliocattleya" context: This context is equally relevant because it identifies Laeliocattleya as a nothogenus of orchid hybrids, which addresses the other half of the claim. 3. "Broughtonia sanguinea" context: While this context is about a specific species within the Broughtonia genus and confirms its membership in the Orchidaceae family, it is slightly less directly related to the claim than the general Broughtonia context. 4. "Hawkinsara" context: This context mentions both Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya, but as part of a hybrid, it is less directly relevant to the claim than the contexts that focus solely on each genus.

Question:In 2017, what was 3/4th of the organization that also has a Center for Veterinary Medicine as well as part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, spent on?
golden idx: [2, 7]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking about the spending of an organization that has a Center for Veterinary Medicine and is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2017. The context that directly answers this question is the one that mentions the budget and spending details of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which fits the description of the organization in the claim. Therefore, the context from the FDA should be ranked highest. Other contexts that mention the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or its related agencies and spending should be ranked next, as they are likely to contain relevant information. Contexts that are about veterinary medicine but do not link to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or its spending should be ranked lower, as they are less likely to contain the answer to the claim.

1. Context idx 7 ("Food and Drug Administration"): Directly answers the claim by mentioning the FDA's budget and spending in 2017.
2. Context idx 4 ("Supporting Healthy Marriage Project"): Mentions funding by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is relevant to the claim.

7. Context idx 0 ("Brenda McCowan"): Mentions affiliation with a School of Veterinary Medicine, which is tangentially relevant.
8. Context idx 8 ("Western University of Health Sciences"): Mentions veterinary medicine but is less likely to contain the answer to the claim about spending.

The remaining contexts are not directly related to the claim and are therefore not included in the top 8.

"Togodumnus" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions a specific ruler, Togodumnus, who died in AD 43 and was a king of the Catuvellauni tribe at the time of the Roman conquest. 2. "Catuvellauni" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it talks about the Celtic tribe of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest. 3. "Roman conquest of Britain" context: This context is relevant as it discusses the Roman conquest beginning in AD 43, which is directly related to the claim. 4. "Romano-British culture" context: This context is informative as it discusses the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire after the conquest in AD 43. 5. "Corieltauvi" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it talks about a tribe living in Britain prior to the Roman conquest, but it's less likely to contain the answer compared to contexts that directly mention the Catuvellauni or the Roman conquest. 6. "AD 43" context: This context provides background on the year AD 43 but does not directly address the claim about the ruler or the conquest. 7. "Durotriges" context: This context is relevant as it discusses another Celtic tribe living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion, but it's less directly related to the claim. 8. "History of England" context: This context is informative and discusses the Roman conquest of Britain, which is relevant to the claim.
idx: [3,5,6,0,2,4,7,9]

step-by-step think: 1. "Roman conquest of Britain" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly discusses the Roman conquest of Britain, which began in AD 43, the same year mentioned in the claim. It also mentions Emperor Claudius, under whose rule the conquest started, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Togodumnus" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Togodumnus, a king of the Catuvellauni tribe during the Roman conquest, and could be identified with the ruler mentioned in the claim. 3. "Catuvellauni" context: This context is relevant as it talks about the Celtic tribe of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, which is the region and time period in question. 4. "Romano-British culture" context: This context is informative as it discusses the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire after the conquest, providing background information that is relevant to the claim.
idx: [6, 3, 5, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. "Roman conquest of Britain" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the Roman conquest of Britain starting in AD 43, which aligns with the time of the Celtic ruler's rule and the empire that conquered southeastern Britain. It is informative and directly addresses the claim. 2. "Togodumnus" context: This context is also relevant because it mentions Togodumnus, a king of the British Catuvellauni tribe during the Roman conquest, and provides a specific date that matches the claim. It likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Catuvellauni" context: This context is relevant as it talks about the Celtic tribe of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, providing background information that is pertinent to the claim. However, it does not directly answer the question about the empire. 4. "Romano-British culture" context: While this context is informative about the culture that arose under the Roman Empire after the conquest, it is less directly related to the claim about the Celtic ruler and the conquering empire.

step-by-step think: The claim is looking for the detective novelist parent of Sue Grafton, the author of '"Q" Is for Quarry'. Context 2 directly mentions Sue Grafton and identifies her father as C. W. Grafton, which is exactly the information needed to answer the claim. Therefore, it ranks highest. Context 4 mentions '"Q" Is for Quarry' and Sue Grafton, but does not mention her parent, so it is relevant but less so than context 2. Context 5 mentions C. Hugh Holman, who is a detective novelist and could be confused with C. W. Grafton, but does not provide the answer to the claim. Contexts 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not mention Sue Grafton or her parent and are therefore not relevant to the claim.

However, it does not provide information about Sue Grafton's parent, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "C. Hugh Holman" context: While this context discusses a detective novelist, there is no indication that C. Hugh Holman is related to Sue Grafton. Therefore, it is less relevant and less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 4. "Andy Straka" context: This context is about another crime novelist and has no apparent connection to Sue Grafton or her parent, making it the least relevant to the claim.

Question:Which of the city at the south of Shelly Beach, New South Wales is a local government area in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia?
golden idx: [1, 7]
step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts, I will consider the geographical location and the local government area mentioned in the claim. The claim is asking for a city south of Shelly Beach, New South Wales, which is a local government area in the Hunter Region. Therefore, I will prioritize contexts that are in the Hunter Region or mention local government areas near Shelly Beach.

1. "City of Newcastle" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions a local government area in the Hunter Region, which is the region specified in the claim. It is likely to contain the answer because it is geographically close to Shelly Beach.
2. "Mount View, New South Wales" context: This context is relevant because it is located in the City of Cessnock local government area, which is in the Hunter Region. It may contain the answer as it is in the vicinity of Shelly Beach.
3. "Gillieston Heights" context: This context is relevant as it mentions a suburb of the City of Maitland local government area in the Hunter Region. It could contain the answer due to its location.
4. "Grahamstown Dam" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it is located within the Port Stephens Council local government area in the Lower Hunter Region. It is less likely to contain the answer but still within the broader region of interest.
5. "Bucketty" context: This context is relevant as it is in the City of Cessnock local government area, which is in the Hunter Region. It is south of the LGA and could potentially contain the answer.
6. "Niagara Park, New South Wales" context: This context is relevant because it is part of the Central Coast Council local government area and is close to Shelly Beach. It may contain the answer due to its proximity.
7. "Shelly Beach, New South Wales" context: This context is directly about Shelly Beach, making it relevant. However, since it is the location in question, it is less likely to contain the answer about a city south of itself.
8. "Unincorporated Far West Region" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses an unincorporated area in the Far West region, which is not in the Hunter Region or near Shelly Beach.

The remaining contexts ("Yanco Agricultural High School" and "Shelly Beach (Manly)") are not relevant to the claim as they do not pertain to the Hunter Region or local government areas near Shelly Beach.

idx: [1, 0, 2, 5, 3, 9, 7, 4]

step-by-step think: To determine the top 4 ranked contexts, I will evaluate each context based on its relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1. "City of Newcastle" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions a local government area in the Hunter region, which is directly related to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer. 2. "City of Cessnock" context (Mount View and Bucketty): Both contexts mention the City of Cessnock, which is in the Hunter Region and could be south of Shelly Beach. They are relevant and may contain the answer. 3. "City of Maitland" context (Gillieston Heights): This context is relevant as it mentions a suburb in the Hunter Region, but it's less likely to be directly south of Shelly Beach compared to Newcastle or Cessnock. 4. "Central Coast Council" context (Niagara Park): This context is relevant because it mentions a location close to Shelly Beach, but it's part of the Central Coast Council, not the Hunter Region. It's informative but less likely to contain the answer to the claim about the city south of Shelly Beach in the Hunter Region.
idx: [1,0,5,2]

step-by-step think: 1. "City of Newcastle" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions that the City of Newcastle is a local government area in the Hunter region, which is directly related to the claim. It is likely to contain the answer since it specifies the location within New South Wales. 2. "Bucketty" context: This context is relevant because it mentions that Bucketty is in the south of the City of Cessnock LGA, adjacent to other LGAs, and provides geographical details that could help determine its position relative to Shelly Beach. It may contain the answer due to its detailed location information. 3. "Mount View, New South Wales" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it talks about a locality in the Hunter Region and is part of the City of Cessnock LGA. It provides some geographical details, but it is less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim compared to the Newcastle context. 4. "Gillieston Heights" context: This context is the least relevant as it focuses on a suburb of the City of Maitland LGA, which is not directly mentioned in relation to the claim. It provides general information about the suburb's history and population but is unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

The remaining contexts are less directly related to the claim about both individuals being musicians.
idx: [9, 7, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: To address the claim about whether Bamboo Mañalac and Danny Jones are both musicians, I will rank the contexts based on their relevance to the claim and the likelihood of containing the answer. 1.

"Danny Jones" context: This context is also highly relevant as it confirms Danny Jones' role as a musician in the band McFly, providing evidence that he is a musician as stated in the claim. 3. "Rivermaya" context: While this context is about the band Rivermaya, it is relevant because it mentions Bamboo Mañalac's role in the band, which supports the claim about his musicianship. 4. "Bamboo (band)" context: This context is informative about the band named Bamboo, which Bamboo Mañalac was a part of, but it is less directly related to the claim compared to the individual contexts of Bamboo Mañalac and Danny Jones.

It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Hanna Varis" context: This context is directly related to Hanna Leena Kristiina Varis and mentions her works being part of the Albertina Museum in Vienna, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 3. "Amistad Dam Port of Entry" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses the number of vehicles crossing a dam, which is unrelated to the claim about Hanna Varis's works. 4. "Gwangjang Market" context: This context is also less relevant because it talks about the number of visitors to a market, not about a collection of works or drawings. 5. "Karaboro languages" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses the number of people speaking a language group, not about art collections. 6. "United Negro College Fund" context: This context is informative but not relevant to the claim about Hanna Varis's works in a museum collection. 7. "Remington Model 51" context: This context is about the production of pistols, which is not relevant to the claim. 8.

step-by-step think: 1. "Albertina" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Albertina museum, which houses approximately 65,000 drawings and prints. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim about Hanna Varis's works being part of a collection. 2. "Hanna Varis" context: This context is directly about Hanna Leena Kristiina Varis and mentions her works being part of major art collections, including the Albertina Museum in Vienna. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Amistad Dam Port of Entry" context: This context mentions the number 65,000 in relation to vehicles, not art collections, making it less relevant to the claim. 4. "Gwangjang Market" context: Although this context also mentions the number 65,000, it refers to daily visitors to the market, not art collections, and is therefore not relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [3, 8]
step-by-step think: To answer the claim about the CBS series starring the actor known for "Rebel Without a Cause," we need to identify contexts that mention both the actor and a CBS series. The most relevant context will be the one that mentions James Dean's involvement in a CBS series, as he is the actor known for "Rebel Without a Cause." Contexts that mention James Dean and television work are likely to be more relevant than those that only mention his film work or other actors.

2. Context idx 3: This context provides a detailed description of James Dean's career, including his iconic role in "Rebel Without a Cause." It is relevant but does not mention a CBS series, so it is less likely to contain the answer than idx 8.

4. Context idx 9: This context mentions Sal Mineo, who starred with James Dean in "Rebel Without a Cause," but does not mention a CBS series, making it less relevant.

The remaining contexts (idx 6 and 7) are not directly relevant as they do not mention James Dean or a CBS series related to "Rebel Without a Cause."

idx: [8, 3, 5, 9, 0, 1, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the year a series aired on CBS, which starred James Dean, known for "Rebel Without a Cause." 1.

Question:What season was the character introduced that becomes the main antagonist in the  following season, from the animated television series created by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino as a sequel to "", which aired from 2005 to 2008? 
golden idx: [4, 8]
step-by-step think: To address the claim, we need to identify the context that discusses the character who becomes the main antagonist in the season following their introduction in "The Legend of Korra". 1. Context idx 4: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Kuvira, who is introduced in the third season and becomes the main antagonist in the fourth season. 2. Context idx 3: This context is also relevant as it discusses Zaheer, who becomes the main antagonist in the third season, but it does not mention his introduction in the previous season. 3. Context idx 6: This context provides an overview of "The Legend of Korra" series, which may contain information about the characters and their development across seasons. 4. Context idx 8: This context gives a general description of "The Legend of Korra" series but is less likely to contain specific information about the antagonist's introduction. 5. Context idx 0: This context talks about Bolin, a major character, but does not mention the antagonist's introduction or development. 6. Context idx 7: This context discusses General Iroh, a character from both series, but is less relevant to the claim. 7. Context idx 1: This context is about "Avatar: The Last Airbender" season 2, which is less relevant as it is not about "The Legend of Korra". 8. Context idx 5: Similar to idx 1, this context is about "Avatar: The Last Airbender" season 3 and not directly relevant to the claim about "The Legend of Korra". The remaining contexts (idx 2 and idx 9) are about "Avatar: The Last Airbender" and do not contribute to answering the claim about "The Legend of Korra".
idx: [4, 3, 6, 8, 0, 7, 1, 5]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the season in which a character was introduced who becomes the main antagonist in the following season of "The Legend of Korra". 1. "Kuvira" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Kuvira being introduced in the third season and becoming the main antagonist in the fourth season. It is informative and contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Zaheer" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Zaheer as the main antagonist of the third season, which is directly related to the claim about the introduction of a character who becomes the main antagonist in the following season. 3. "The Legend of Korra" context: This context provides an overview of the series, including its airing dates and premise. It is relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim compared to the contexts that mention specific characters. 4. "List of The Legend of Korra episodes" context: This context provides information about the series' episodes and seasons, which could be useful for understanding the timeline of character introductions. It is relevant and may contain clues to the answer.
idx: [4, 3, 8, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Kuvira" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Kuvira being introduced in the third season and becoming the main antagonist in the fourth season, directly answering the claim. 2. "Zaheer" context: While this context is about a different character, it is still relevant because it discusses the main antagonist of the third season, which is directly before the season where Kuvira becomes the main antagonist. 3. "The Legend of Korra" context: This context provides general information about the series, including its timeline and the concept of the Avatar, which is relevant but less directly connected to the claim than the specific character contexts. 4. "List of The Legend of Korra episodes" context: This context offers an overview of the series' episodes and seasons, which is informative but does not directly address the claim about the antagonist's introduction.

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the context that directly answers the claim by mentioning the 2009 American science fiction film and its directors.

The remaining contexts are related to specific episodes of "Dexter" and do not provide information about the film "Gamer" or its directors.

Contexts 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are not relevant to the claim as they do not mention "Son of al Qaeda" or related settlements.

Question:Considered the strongest recorded tropical cyclone, which cyclone had a film made about it in 2007?
golden idx: [3, 6]
step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first identify the context that directly mentions a film made about a cyclone, as this is the specific detail in the claim. Context 6 titled 'Kathantara' is the only one that mentions a film made about a cyclone, specifically the 1999 Odisha cyclone, and therefore it ranks highest. Next, I will look for contexts that mention cyclones considered the strongest recorded, as this is another key detail in the claim. Context 3 about the 1999 Odisha cyclone is highly relevant as it is described as the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean. Context 5 about Cyclone Gonu is also relevant as it is noted as the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea. The remaining contexts will be ranked based on the relevance of their content to the claim, with priority given to those that mention significant strength or records related to cyclones. Contexts that do not directly relate to the claim or do not mention a cyclone's strength will be ranked lower.
idx: [6, 3, 5, 0, 1, 2, 7, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "1999 Odisha cyclone" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which is considered the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and matches the claim's timeframe with a film made about it in 2007. 2.

"Cyclone Gonu" context: While this context talks about Cyclone Gonu being the strongest in the Arabian Sea, it is less relevant because the claim specifically asks for the cyclone with a film made about it in 2007, which is not mentioned here. 4. "Cyclone Hondo" context: This context is informative about Cyclone Hondo during the 2007–08 season, but it does not mention any film, making it less relevant to the claim.
idx: [3,6,5,1]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the strongest recorded tropical cyclone that had a film made about it in 2007. 1. "Kathantara" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions a film made about the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which aligns with the claim's request for a cyclone with a film made about it in 2007. 2. "1999 Odisha cyclone" context: This context provides detailed information about the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which is considered the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and is the subject of the film mentioned in the "Kathantara" context. 3. "Cyclone Gonu" context: Although this context talks about Cyclone Gonu being the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea, it does not mention a film made about it in 2007, making it less relevant than the first two contexts. 4. "Cyclone Hondo" context: This context is about Cyclone Hondo and provides extensive details about its development and impact. However, it does not mention a film made about it in 2007, making it the least relevant to the claim.

The other contexts are about different subjects and are not relevant to the claim.
idx: [5, 0, 8, 9]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for the common actor between two instances of "American Beauty." 1.

"California Hot Rod Reunion" context: This context mentions the "National Hot Rod Association" and a reunion event, which might confuse readers about the "Hot Rod" magazine but is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 5. "National Hot Rod Reunion" context: Similar to the previous context, it discusses an event related to hot rodding but does not directly address the claim about magazines. 6. "Hot Rod Lincoln" context: This context is about a song and does not provide information about the magazine, making it less relevant. 7. "Rat rod" context: This context discusses a style of hot rod cars and does not mention magazines, so it is not relevant to the claim. 8.

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 7: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Rear Adm. J. Edward Snyder, who was the captain of the USS "New Jersey" during its deployment to the Vietnam War, directly answering the claim. 2. Context idx 2: This context is also highly relevant because it talks about the USS "New Jersey" itself, which was the only battleship providing gunfire support during the Vietnam War, and it is likely to contain further details about the captain. 3. Context idx 3: This context is relevant as it discusses the United States Seventh Fleet's involvement in naval gunfire support during the Vietnam War, which is related to the USS "New Jersey's" role. 4. Context idx 9: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions Operation Market Time, which involved naval gunfire support, but it is less directly related to the USS "New Jersey" or its captain. The other contexts are about different ships or broader topics and are less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
idx: [7, 2, 3, 9]

step-by-step think: 1. Context from 'J. Edward Snyder': This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Rear Adm. J. Edward Snyder being the captain of the USS "New Jersey" during its deployment to the Vietnam War, which is the specific information the claim is asking for. 2. Context from 'USS New Jersey (BB-62)': This context is also highly relevant because it talks about the USS "New Jersey" being the only battleship providing gunfire support during the Vietnam War, which is directly related to the claim. 3. Context from 'Operation Market Time': This context is relevant as it discusses the United States Navy's efforts during the Vietnam War, including gunfire support, but it does not specifically mention the USS "New Jersey" or its captain. 4. Context from 'Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club': This context is less relevant because it talks about the United States Seventh Fleet in general and does not specifically mention the USS "New Jersey" or its captain.

Question:The Polar Bears featuring the voice of Armie Hammer, is also the same voice actor for which character in Cars 3?
golden idx: [3, 5]
step-by-step think: To determine the relevance of each context to the claim, I will consider how directly each context relates to Armie Hammer's voice acting in "Cars 3" and "The Polar Bears". Context 5 explicitly mentions Armie Hammer's role as the voice of Jackson Storm in "Cars 3", making it highly relevant. Context 7 details "Cars 3" and includes Armie Hammer in the cast, which is also highly relevant. Context 3 describes "The Polar Bears" film and lists Armie Hammer as a voice actor, directly connecting to the claim. Context 1 mentions Armie Hammer's role in "The Lone Ranger", which is less relevant but still informative about his acting career. Context 2 includes information about Cheech Marin, who voiced characters in "Cars 3", providing indirect relevance. Context 6 mentions "The Cars", which could be confused with the film "Cars", but is about a music album, making it less relevant. Contexts 0, 4, 8, and 9 do not mention Armie Hammer's voice acting or "Cars 3" and are therefore the least relevant.

step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Arthur Conan Doyle and Penelope Lively, we need to find the contexts that provide their birth dates. 1. Context idx 7: This context provides the birth date of Arthur Conan Doyle (22 May 1859), which is directly relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 9: This context provides the birth date of Penelope Lively (17 March 1933), which is also directly relevant to the claim. These two contexts are the most informative and relevant as they allow us to answer the question. 3. Context idx 5: This context mentions Adrian Conan Doyle's birth year (1910), which indirectly informs us that Arthur Conan Doyle was born before this date. 4. Context idx 3: This context mentions a person who was a contemporary of Arthur Conan Doyle, which could suggest the time period but is less directly relevant. 5. Context idx 1: This context talks about a film from 1916 involving Arthur Conan Doyle's character, which indirectly suggests his active years. 6. Context idx 2: Similar to context idx 1, it discusses a film from 1929 based on Conan Doyle's work. 7. Context idx 4: This context discusses a TV series based on Conan Doyle's work, indicating his influence but not directly his birth date. 8. Context idx 0: This context is about a book authorized by the Conan Doyle Estate, which is the least relevant to the claim.
idx: [7,9,5,3,1,2,4,0]

step-by-step think: To determine who was born first between Arthur Conan Doyle and Penelope Lively, the contexts that provide their birth dates are most relevant. 1. "Arthur Conan Doyle" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth date of Arthur Conan Doyle, which is essential to answer the claim. 2. "Penelope Lively" context: This context is equally relevant because it provides the exact birth date of Penelope Lively. With both birth dates available, we can determine who was born first. 3. "Adrian Conan Doyle" context: This context is about Arthur Conan Doyle's son, which is less relevant to the claim but still related to the Doyle family. 4. "Douglas Ainslie" context: This context mentions Arthur Conan Doyle in relation to Douglas Ainslie, but it does not provide information directly relevant to the claim. The other contexts are about works related to Arthur Conan Doyle and do not provide information about birth dates, making them less relevant to the claim.

step-by-step think:1. "Arthur Conan Doyle" context: This context is highly relevant as it provides the exact birth and death dates of Arthur Conan Doyle, directly addressing the claim about who was born first. 2. "Penelope Lively" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides the birth date of Penelope Lively, which is necessary to answer the claim. 3. "Adrian Conan Doyle" context: While this context is about the son of Arthur Conan Doyle, it is less relevant to the claim than the contexts directly about the individuals in question. However, it is more relevant than the "Douglas Ainslie" context, which does not mention the birth dates of either individual. 4.

Question:The Tennessee Volunteers football team plays as a member for a conference in what city?
golden idx: [0, 6]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for the city where the conference that the Tennessee Volunteers football team is a member of is located. Context 6 directly addresses the Southeastern Conference (SEC), which is the conference in question, and mentions that its headquarters is in Birmingham, Alabama, which is the answer to the claim. Therefore, it ranks highest. Contexts 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 mention the Tennessee Volunteers football team and their association with the SEC, but they do not mention the location of the conference itself, making them relevant but not as informative as context 6 for this specific claim. Context 7, while related to the Tennessee Volunteers, is focused on statistical leaders and does not provide information about the conference's location, making it the least relevant to the claim.
idx: [6,0,1,9,5,4,2,8]

step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts for the claim regarding the Tennessee Volunteers football team's conference city, I will consider the direct mention of the conference and its location. 1. "Southeastern Conference" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the SEC and its headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama, which is likely the answer to the claim. 2. "1984 Tennessee Volunteers football team" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the team playing as a member of the SEC and their home games in Knoxville, Tennessee, but it does not mention the conference city. 3. "1983 Tennessee Volunteers football team" context: Similar to the 1984 context, it mentions the team's association with the SEC and playing in Knoxville, Tennessee. 4. "1985 Tennessee Volunteers football team" context: This context also mentions the team's association with the SEC and playing in Knoxville, Tennessee. The other contexts are less relevant as they do not mention the SEC headquarters or the conference city.
idx: [6,0,1,9]

step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the city in which the conference, of which the Tennessee Volunteers football team is a member, is located. 1. "Southeastern Conference" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and provides information about its location, which is Birmingham, Alabama. It directly answers the question about the city where the conference is headquartered. 2. "1985 Tennessee Volunteers football team" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the Tennessee Volunteers playing as a member of the SEC and provides details about their season. However, it does not mention the location of the SEC. 3. "1984 Tennessee Volunteers football team" context: Similar to the previous context, this one is relevant because it discusses the Tennessee Volunteers as part of the SEC, but it also does not mention the location of the SEC. 4. "1983 Tennessee Volunteers football team" context: This context is relevant as it pertains to the Tennessee Volunteers and the SEC, but like the others, it does not provide the location of the SEC headquarters.

"Ernest Foot" context: This context is directly related to Ernest Foot and mentions that he was the best friend of Albert Ball, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. "Albert Ball" context: This context provides information about Albert Ball, including the number of victories he had, which is the answer to the claim. 3. "Manfred Meurer" context: While this context is about a fighter pilot with many victories, it does not mention a connection to Ernest Foot, making it less relevant. 4. "Egon Mayer" context: Similar to the Meurer context, it discusses a fighter pilot's victories but lacks a direct link to Ernest Foot. 5. "Ilmari Juutilainen" context: This context is about a top-scoring fighter pilot but does not mention Ernest Foot or his best friend. 6. "Paul Zorner" context: This context discusses another fighter pilot's victories but again lacks a connection to Ernest Foot. 7. "Lydia Litvyak" context: This context is about a female fighter pilot's victories and does not relate to Ernest Foot. 8. "Ayesha Farooq" context: This context is about a Pakistani female fighter pilot and does not mention Ernest Foot or his best friend. The remaining contexts are about fighter pilots or related topics but do not provide information about Ernest Foot's best friend's victories.
idx: [9, 2, 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 3]

step-by-step think: The claim is specifically about the number of victories of the fighter pilot who was the best friend of Ernest Foot. Therefore, the most relevant contexts will be those that mention Ernest Foot and his best friend, as well as the number of victories of the best friend.
1. "Albert Ball" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Albert Ball, who is identified as the best friend of Ernest Foot, and provides the exact number of victories (44), which is the answer to the claim.
2. "Ernest Foot" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Ernest Foot and his connection to Albert Ball, but it does not provide the number of victories, which is the key information needed to answer the claim.
3. "Egon Mayer" context: While this context provides information about a fighter pilot with a significant number of victories, it is not directly related to Ernest Foot or his best friend, making it less relevant to the claim.
4. "Manfred Meurer" context: Similar to the Egon Mayer context, this one also talks about a fighter pilot with many victories but lacks direct relevance to Ernest Foot or his best friend.
The remaining contexts are even less relevant as they do not pertain to Ernest Foot or his best friend and their aerial victories during World War I.
idx: [2, 9, 1, 0]

step-by-step think: 1. "Albert Ball" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Albert Ball, who is directly related to the claim. It provides specific information about his victories, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Ernest Foot" context: This context is relevant because it mentions Ernest Foot's relationship with Albert Ball, confirming the connection stated in the claim. However, it does not provide the number of victories, which is the specific answer sought. 3. "Manfred Meurer" context: This context is about a different fighter pilot and does not mention Albert Ball or Ernest Foot. It is informative but less relevant to the claim. 4. "Egon Mayer" context: Similar to the "Manfred Meurer" context, this one is about a different fighter pilot and does not mention the individuals relevant to the claim. It is informative but not relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [7, 9]

"Farrukhzad Khosrow V" context: This context is directly relevant as it mentions Farrukhzad Khosrau V and specifies that he was king of the Sasanian Empire. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Sasanian Empire" context: This context provides a comprehensive overview of the Sasanian Empire, which is directly related to the claim. It is informative and likely contains the answer. 3. "Khosrow IV" context: This context discusses a Sasanian usurper who ruled briefly in 631, which is relevant to the timeframe of the claim. It may contain additional information about the empire's succession. 4. "Hormizd VI" context: This context talks about another Sasanian king who was a contemporary of Farrukhzad Khosrau V, providing context to the empire's succession. 5. "Ashur-etil-ilani" context: Although this context is about a king of Assyria, the timeframe is significantly earlier (631 BC), making it less relevant. 6. "Samo's Empire" context: This context is about a different empire that existed during the same period, which may provide some historical context but is less directly related to the claim. 7. "Samo" context: Similar to the "Samo's Empire" context, it provides background on the period but is less relevant to the claim. 8. "Chach of Alor" context: This context discusses a different region and ruler, making it the least relevant to the claim about Farrukhzad Khosrau V and the Sasanian Empire.
idx: [7,9,5,8,4,3,0,2]

step-by-step think:1. "Farrukhzad Khosrow V" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Farrukhzad Khosrau V and states that he was king of the Sasanian Empire, which is the empire in question. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Sasanian Empire" context: This context provides detailed information about the Sasanian Empire, including its time period and succession from the Parthian Empire. It is relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 3. "Khosrow IV" context: While this context mentions a ruler during the same period, it is less directly related to Farrukhzad Khosrau V but still provides useful background information on the Sasanian Empire's state during that time. 4. "Hormizd VI" context: This context is relevant as it discusses another pretender to the throne around the same time as Farrukhzad Khosrau V, offering insight into the political climate of the Sasanian Empire during the transition period.
idx: [7, 9, 5, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Farrukhzad Khosrow V" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Farrukhzad Khosrau V and states that he was king of the Sasanian Empire, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Sasanian Empire" context: This context is also highly relevant because it provides detailed information about the Sasanian Empire, including the time frame of its existence and its succession from the Parthian Empire. 3. "Hormizd VI" context: This context is relevant as it discusses Hormizd VI, a Sasanian king who was a contemporary of Farrukhzad Khosrau V, and provides context about the period of upheaval in the Sasanian Empire. It is less directly related to Farrukhzad Khosrau V but still provides useful background information. 4. "Khosrow IV" context: While this context mentions a ruler during the same period, it is less relevant because it does not directly address the claim or provide clear information about the succession of empires.

Question:Are both Dafeng District and Dazhou located in the same province?
golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: To determine the relevance of each context to the claim, I will evaluate how directly each context discusses the locations in question and whether they provide information about the provinces they are located in. 1. "Dafeng District" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Dafeng District and specifies that it is located in Jiangsu province, China. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. "Dazhou" context: This context is also highly relevant because it mentions Dazhou and specifies that it is located in Sichuan province, China. It is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Tinghu District" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Dafeng District as one of the districts of Yancheng, Jiangsu province, but it is less direct than the "Dafeng District" context. 4. "Yandu District" context: Similar to the "Tinghu District" context, this context is relevant because it mentions Dafeng District as part of Yancheng, Jiangsu province. 5. "Sichuan–Shanghai gas pipeline" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions Dazhou in the context of a gas pipeline, but it does provide location information about Dazhou being in Sichuan province. The remaining contexts do not mention the locations in question and are therefore not relevant.

step-by-step think: 1. "Dafeng District" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Dafeng District and its location in Jiangsu province, directly addressing half of the claim. 2. "Dazhou" context: This context is equally important because it specifies that Dazhou is in Sichuan province, providing the other half of the needed information to answer the claim. 3. "Tinghu District" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Dafeng District as part of Yancheng, Jiangsu province, which indirectly supports the information provided in the "Dafeng District" context. 4. "Yandu District" context: Similar to the "Tinghu District" context, this also mentions Dafeng District's location in Jiangsu province, supporting the claim's answer. 5. "Sichuan–Shanghai gas pipeline" context: This context is less directly related to the claim but mentions Dazhou and its connection to Sichuan province, which is useful for answering the claim. The remaining contexts are not provided, but they would be ranked based on their decreasing relevance and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.
idx: [2, 3, 0, 1, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. "Dafeng District" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Dafeng District and provides detailed information about its location in Jiangsu province, which is directly related to the claim.

Question:In what century did this Native warrior and chief, whose brother Tenskwatawa led the Tippecanoe order of battle, become the primary leader of a large, multi tribal confederacy?
golden idx: [3, 9]
step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the century in which a Native American warrior and chief, who is the brother of Tenskwatawa and led a multi-tribal confederacy, became the primary leader. The most relevant contexts will be those that discuss Tecumseh, Tenskwatawa, and the confederacy they were involved in. 

1. "Tecumseh's Confederacy" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the confederacy led by Tecumseh and mentions the early 19th century, which is crucial to identifying the century in question.
2. "Tecumseh" context: This context directly talks about Tecumseh, the Native American warrior and chief in question, and mentions the early years of the 19th century.
3. "Tenskwatawa" context: This context is relevant because it discusses Tenskwatawa, the brother of Tecumseh, and provides background information that could lead to identifying the century.
4. "Battle of Tippecanoe" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the battle led by Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh's involvement, which is related to the timeframe of Tecumseh's leadership.
5. "Tippecanoe order of battle" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it mentions the battle and the leaders, which could help in deducing the century.
6. "Prophetstown State Park" context: This context is less relevant but still useful as it mentions the location named after Tenskwatawa and its relation to the Battle of Tippecanoe.
7. "Battle of Fallen Timbers" context: This context is indirectly relevant as it discusses events related to the Northwest Indian War, which is part of the broader historical context of Tecumseh's time.
8. "Ziri ibn Atiyya" context: This context is not relevant to the claim as it discusses a different tribal leader and confederacy.

The remaining contexts ("Zafar, Yemen" and "Kasi (Pashtun tribe)") are not relevant to the claim as they discuss unrelated regions and tribal confederacies. Therefore, they are not included in the top 8 ranked contexts.

idx: [2, 9, 0, 6, 3, 1, 8, 4]

step-by-step think:1. "Tecumseh's Confederacy" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Tecumseh becoming the leader of the confederacy as early as 1808, which directly answers the claim about the century in which he became the primary leader. 2. "Tecumseh" context: This context is also highly relevant because it discusses Tecumseh's leadership and the early years of the nineteenth century, providing a clear timeframe for when he became the leader. 3. "Battle of Tippecanoe" context: This context is relevant as it involves Tecumseh and the confederacy during the period in question, although it focuses more on the battle rather than Tecumseh's leadership timeline. 4. "Tenskwatawa" context: This context is informative about Tecumseh's brother and provides background on the family and the confederacy, which is relevant to understanding the broader historical setting.
idx: [2,9,6,0]

It provides a detailed account of the confederacy's activities, including the Battle of Tippecanoe, and mentions the year 1808, which is crucial to answering the claim. 2. "Tecumseh" context: This context is also highly relevant because it focuses on Tecumseh himself, detailing his rise as a leader and his vision for the confederacy. It pinpoints the early years of the nineteenth century, aligning with the claim's timeframe. 3. "Battle of Tippecanoe" context: While this context is about an event related to Tecumseh and mentions him, it is more focused on the battle itself rather than Tecumseh's leadership timeline. It is relevant but less so than the contexts that focus on Tecumseh's leadership directly. 4. "Tenskwatawa" context: This context provides background on Tenskwatawa, Tecumseh's brother, and while it is informative about his role and transformation, it is less directly related to the claim about Tecumseh's leadership timeline.

Context 7 talks about Irish Americans in Boston, which is somewhat relevant but less so than context 1. Context 4 mentions the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish Catholic fraternal organization, which could be tangentially related to the Irish Catholic immigrants mentioned in the claim. Contexts 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8 are not directly relevant to the claim as they do not mention the Shiners' War or the ethnic groups involved in the conflict in Canada.

"Sala (architecture)" context: This context discusses a type of pavilion found in Thailand and is not related to the claim about Darling's Waterfront Pavilion in Bangor, Maine. It is not relevant. 5. "Corus Quay" context: This context is about a commercial office tower in Toronto and does not relate to the claim. It is not relevant. 6. "Paulus Hook, Jersey City" context: This context is about a community in Jersey City and does not relate to the claim. It is not relevant. 7. "Grandview Park Music Pavilion" context: This context is about a music pavilion in Sioux City, Iowa, and does not relate to the claim. It is not relevant. 8. "Concord Pavilion" context: This context is about an amphitheatre in Concord, California, and does not relate to the claim. It is not relevant. 9. "Kertha Gosa Pavilion" context: This context is about a pavilion in Bali, Indonesia, and does not relate to the claim. It is not relevant. 10. "Silver Line Way (MBTA station)" context: This context is about a bus station in Boston and does not relate to the claim. It is not relevant.
idx: [1, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

step-by-step think: To determine the most relevant contexts for the claim about the nickname of the city where Darling's Waterfront Pavilion is located, I will consider the direct mention of the pavilion and the city, as well as any information that links the city to its nickname. 1. Context idx 9: This context directly mentions "Bangor, Maine" and provides the specific nickname "Queen City," which is the answer to the claim. It is highly relevant and informative. 2. Context idx 1: This context mentions Darling's Waterfront Pavilion and its location in Bangor, Maine. It is relevant as it establishes the connection between the pavilion and the city. 3. Context idx 0: This context is about a different pavilion and does not mention Bangor or a nickname, making it less relevant. 4. Context idx 2: This context discusses architectural structures in Thailand, which is unrelated to the claim about Darling's Waterfront Pavilion in Maine. 5. Context idx 3: This context talks about Corus Quay in Toronto, which is not relevant to the claim. 6. Context idx 4: This context describes Paulus Hook in Jersey City, which is unrelated to the claim. 7. Context idx 5: This context is about the Grandview Park Music Pavilion in Sioux City, Iowa, and does not mention Bangor or a nickname. 8. Context idx 6: This context is about the Concord Pavilion in California, which is not relevant to the claim.
idx: [9, 1, 0, 5]

step-by-step think:1. "Bangor, Maine" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Bangor, Maine, and refers to it as the "Queen City" of Maine, which is the nickname in question. It is informative and most likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. "Darling's Waterfront Pavilion" context: This context is relevant because it mentions the Darling's Waterfront Pavilion and its location in Bangor, Maine. While it does not directly provide the nickname, it is closely related to the claim and could guide one to the answer. 3. "Oleson Park Music Pavilion" context: This context is less relevant as it discusses a different pavilion in a different city and state. It is informative but unlikely to contain the answer to the claim about the nickname of the city where Darling's Waterfront Pavilion is located. 4. "Grandview Park Music Pavilion" context: Similar to the Oleson Park context, this one is also about a different pavilion in a different city and is therefore not directly relevant to the claim.

Question:The Kansas City Wizards have had three home venues in Kansas City in their time.  Which was their first?
golden idx: [5, 9]
step-by-step think: To determine the first home venue of the Kansas City Wizards, I will prioritize contexts that mention the team's early history or initial playing venues. 1. "1997 Kansas City Wizards season" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses the team's second season and mentions Arrowhead Stadium, which is a potential candidate for the first venue. 2. "1998 Kansas City Wizards season" context: Similar to the 1997 context, this one also mentions Arrowhead Stadium during the team's third season, reinforcing its relevance. 3. "1999 Kansas City Wizards season" context: This context continues to discuss the team's history at Arrowhead Stadium, adding to the likelihood of it being the first venue. 4. "Children's Mercy Park" context: This context is informative as it outlines the team's venue history, including Arrowhead Stadium as the first venue from 1996 to 2007. 5. "CommunityAmerica Ballpark" context: It mentions the Wizards' time at CommunityAmerica Ballpark, but as a later venue, it's less relevant for the first venue query. 6. "2008 Kansas City Wizards season" context: This context confirms CommunityAmerica Ballpark as a temporary home, which suggests it was not the first venue. 7. "Shawnee Mission District Stadium" context: This context is less relevant as it mentions a single match played by the Wizards at the stadium, not as a regular home venue. 8. "All-time Sporting Kansas City roster" context: While it provides historical information about the team, it does not focus on home venues, making it less relevant.
idx: [2,0,3,9,5,7,4,8]

step-by-step think: The claim is about identifying the first home venue of the Kansas City Wizards. 1. Context idx 9: This context mentions that the Kansas City Wizards played in Arrowhead Stadium from 1996 to 2007, which is directly relevant to the claim and indicates that Arrowhead Stadium was their first home venue. 2. Context idx 2: This context talks about the 1997 season being played at Arrowhead Stadium, which supports the information that it was an early venue for the team. 3. Context idx 0: This context also mentions Arrowhead Stadium as the venue for the 1998 season, further supporting its relevance. 4. Context idx 3: This context mentions the 1999 season at Arrowhead Stadium and includes additional information about team management changes, which is less directly related to the claim but still relevant. The other contexts mention other venues and seasons but are not as directly related to the claim about the first home venue.
idx: [9, 2, 0, 3]

step-by-step think:1. Context with 'idx': 9 is the most relevant as it explicitly states that Children's Mercy Park is Sporting Kansas City's third home venue and mentions the first venue as Arrowhead Stadium where the team played from 1996 to 2007. This directly answers the claim about the first home venue. 2. Context with 'idx': 2 is the second most relevant because it discusses the 1997 season played at Arrowhead Stadium, which is the first home venue according to the previous context. This context supports the information about the first venue but is less direct than the first context. 3. Context with 'idx': 0 is relevant as it also mentions Arrowhead Stadium, but it refers to the 1998 season, which is after the 1997 season mentioned in the second context. This context is informative but ranks lower because it is less directly related to the claim about the first venue.

golden idx: [2, 3]
step-by-step think: The claim is about Henry Hall, known for his role in the Revolutionary War and for being the first to cultivate a food found in a specific type of bog. The most relevant context would be the one that mentions Henry Hall and his cultivation of cranberries in bogs. 1. "Henry Hall (American revolution)" context: This context is directly related to the claim as it mentions Henry Hall and his cultivation of cranberries, which is the answer to the claim. 2. "Cranberry" context: This context is highly relevant as it discusses cranberries and their cultivation in bogs, which is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Blanket bog" context: This context is relevant as it describes the type of bog where cranberries could be cultivated. 4. "John Adlum" context: This context is somewhat relevant because it mentions cultivation and the Revolutionary War, but it's about a different person and plant. 5. "Historic Camden Revolutionary War Site" context: This context is relevant to the Revolutionary War aspect of the claim but does not mention Henry Hall or cranberries. 6. "Robert Plampin" context: This context is related to the Revolutionary War but does not mention Henry Hall or cranberry cultivation. 7. "Carnival Cravings" context: This context is about unique food found at carnivals and is not directly relevant to the claim. 8. "Cuisine of Karachi" context: This context is about the cuisine of Karachi and is not relevant to the claim about Henry Hall or cranberries.
idx: [3, 2, 7, 1, 6, 5, 0, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions Henry Hall and his association with the cultivation of cranberries, which is the food in question. It also connects to the Revolutionary War, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 2: This context provides detailed information about cranberries, including their cultivation and the types of bogs they are found in. It is informative and directly related to the second part of the claim regarding the type of bogs. 3. Context idx 7: This context talks about blanket bogs, which is relevant to the claim as it pertains to the type of bogs where cranberries could be cultivated. However, it does not mention Henry Hall or cranberries specifically. 4. Context idx 1: This context is about John Adlum, who also served in the Revolutionary War and cultivated grapes, not cranberries. It is less relevant to the claim but still contains information about cultivation and the Revolutionary War.
idx: [3, 2, 7, 1]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 3: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Henry Hall and his association with the cultivation of cranberries, directly addressing the claim. 2. Context idx 2: This context provides detailed information about cranberries, including the types and where they are cultivated, which is relevant to the claim about the type of bogs where the food is found. 3. Context idx 7: This context talks about blanket bogs, which is relevant since cranberries are found in acidic bogs, but it does not directly mention cranberries or Henry Hall. 4. Context idx 1: This context is about John Adlum, who is associated with viticulture and not cranberry cultivation, making it the least relevant to the claim.

Question:A scam involving a male calling small town fast-food restaurants and pretending to be a police officer to have them strip search employees was turned into a movie of what name?
golden idx: [1, 3]
step-by-step think: The claim involves a scam with a male caller pretending to be a police officer, leading to strip searches at fast-food restaurants, which was then turned into a movie. To rank the contexts, I will consider their relevance to the scam and the likelihood of containing the answer about the movie's name.
1. "Compliance (film)" context: This context is directly relevant as it describes a film based on the strip search prank call scam, which is the subject of the claim. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. "Strip search phone call scam" context: This context is highly relevant as it details the scam itself. While it may not directly mention the movie's name, it is informative and closely related to the claim.
3. "Part-time job terrorism" context: This context is somewhat relevant as it discusses pranks in fast-food restaurants, which is similar to the setting of the scam. However, it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the first two contexts.
4. "Police perjury" context: This context is relevant to the extent that it involves police behavior, but it is less directly related to the claim than the contexts that discuss the scam or the movie.
5. "Devyani Khobragade" context: This context mentions a strip search, which is a component of the scam, but it is about a different incident and is less likely to contain the answer to the claim.
6. "Body cavity search" context: This context is related to strip searches but does not directly address the scam or the movie, making it less relevant.
7. "A&W Restaurants" context: This context is about a fast-food chain but does not relate to the scam or the movie, making it less relevant.
8. "Ringer Hut" context: Similar to the A&W context, this is about a fast-food chain with no direct relation to the scam or the movie.
The remaining contexts ("Jacob D. Robida" and "Coronado, Panama") are not relevant to the claim as they do not discuss the scam, fast-food restaurants, or related movies.
idx: [3, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 2, 6]

step-by-step think: 1. "Compliance (film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly relates to the claim. It mentions the movie "Compliance," which is based on the strip search prank call scam, and provides detailed information about the film and its plot, which aligns with the claim. 2. "Strip search phone call scam" context: This context is also highly relevant because it describes the scam that the movie "Compliance" is based on. It provides background information on the incidents and the nature of the calls, which is likely to contain the answer to the claim. 3. "Body cavity search" context: While this context is related to the topic of strip searches, it does not directly address the claim about the movie. However, it provides information on the procedure of body cavity searches, which might be informative in the context of the scam. 4. "Police perjury" context: This context is less directly related to the claim but involves police officers and unlawful acts, which could be tangentially related to the scam mentioned in the claim. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim than the contexts ranked higher.
idx: [3, 1, 5, 9]

step-by-step think:1. "Compliance (film)" context: This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the movie "Compliance," which is based on the strip search prank call scam, aligning closely with the claim. It provides detailed information about the film and its plot, which is based on the same scam described in the claim. Therefore, it is most likely to contain the answer. 2. "Strip search phone call scam" context: This context is also highly relevant because it describes the scam itself, which is the subject of the claim. It provides background information about the series of incidents and the nature of the scam, making it likely to contain the answer. 3. "Police perjury" context: While this context is related to police activity, it does not directly address the claim about the scam or the movie. However, it is somewhat relevant because it involves police deception, which is a component of the scam. It is less likely than the first two contexts to contain the answer but is more relevant than the "Body cavity search" context.

Question:Which genus has more species, Xanthoceras or Ehretia?
golden idx: [0, 1]
step-by-step think: The claim asks for a comparison between the number of species in the genera Xanthoceras and Ehretia. Context 0 provides information about the genus Ehretia, stating it contains about 50 species. This is directly relevant to the claim and highly likely to contain the answer. Context 1 discusses the genus Xanthoceras, but it specifies that it is the only species in the genus, which is also highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. Since both contexts are equally important to determine which genus has more species, they should be ranked equally.
idx: [0, 1]

step-by-step think: The claim asks for a comparison between the number of species in the genera Xanthoceras and Ehretia. Context 0 provides information about the genus Ehretia, stating it contains about 50 species. This is directly relevant to the claim and highly likely to contain the answer. Context 1 describes Xanthoceras sorbifolium as the only species in the genus Xanthoceras, which is also highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. Since both contexts are equally important to determine which genus has more species, they are ranked equally.
idx: [0, 1]

step-by-step think: The context titled "Ehretia" directly relates to the claim as it provides specific information about the genus Ehretia, mentioning that it contains about 50 species. This is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. The context titled "Xanthoceras" also directly relates to the claim, but it specifies that Xanthoceras is a monotypic genus, meaning it contains only one species. This context is equally relevant but, in terms of species count, less informative than the Ehretia context for answering the claim.

"Dizzy Dean" context: This context is the least relevant as it discusses a player inducted in 1953 and does not mention the anthology series.

Question:How many laps did Harry Prowell run during the 10,000 metres race at the 1967 Pan American Games?
golden idx: [0, 3]
step-by-step think: To determine the number of laps Harry Prowell ran during the 10,000 metres race at the 1967 Pan American Games, the most relevant context would be one that mentions both Harry Prowell and the specific event. Context 3, which is about Harry Prowell, directly mentions his participation in the 10,000 metres at the 1967 Pan American Games, making it the most relevant and likely to contain the answer. Context 0 provides general information about the 10,000 metres race, including the number of laps in such a race, which is crucial for answering the question. Context 2 mentions another athlete's participation in the 1967 Pan American Games, which could potentially contain information about the event in question. Contexts 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are less relevant as they do not directly relate to Harry Prowell or the 1967 Pan American Games. However, they are related to the 10,000 metres race or the Pan American Games in different years, which might offer some useful background information. Context 6 is the least relevant as it pertains to the 2011 Pan American Games, which is far removed from the 1967 event in question.
idx: [3, 0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8]

step-by-step think: 1. "Harry Prowell" context: This context is highly relevant as it mentions Harry Prowell and his participation in the 10,000 metres at the 1967 Pan American Games. It is likely to contain information about his performance in the race, including the number of laps he ran. 2. "10,000 metres" context: This context is directly relevant to the claim as it describes the 10,000 metres race and specifies that it consists of 25 laps around an Olympic-sized track. This information is crucial to answering the question about the number of laps. 3. "Dave Bailey (athlete)" context: This context mentions the 1967 Pan American Games and provides information about an athlete who competed in events during the same games. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim about Harry Prowell's laps. 4. "Nora Rocha" context: This context is relevant as it mentions the women's 10,000 metres at the Pan American Games, although it is from a different year (1999). It may not contain the answer to the claim but is related to the 10,000 metres event at the Pan American Games. 5. "European 10,000m Cup" context: This context is informative about the 10,000 metres race in Europe but does not relate to Harry Prowell or the 1967 Pan American Games. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim. 6. "Ross MacKenzie (athlete)" context: This context mentions the 1967 Pan American Games but focuses on the 400 metres and relay events, not the 10,000 metres race. It is less relevant to the claim. 7. "Brian MacLaren" context: Similar to the previous context, this one also mentions the 1967 Pan American Games but focuses on the 400 metres and 800 metres events, not the 10,000 metres race. It is less relevant to the claim. 8. "Kavita Tungar" context: This context is about a long-distance runner and mentions the 10,000 metres race at the Commonwealth and Asian Games, but it does not relate to Harry Prowell or the 1967 Pan American Games. It is the least relevant to the claim.
idx: [3, 0, 2, 4]

step-by-step think: 1. Context idx 0: This context directly provides information about the 10,000 metres race, including the number of laps, which is 25. Since the claim asks for the number of laps Harry Prowell ran, this context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 2. Context idx 3: This context mentions Harry Prowell and his participation in the 10,000 metres at the 1967 Pan American Games, making it relevant to the claim. However, it does not specify the number of laps he ran, so it is less likely to contain the direct answer compared to context idx 0. 3. Context idx 4: This context is about Nora Rocha and her performance in the 10,000 metres at the 1999 Pan American Games. It is relevant to the 10,000 metres event but not directly to Harry Prowell or the 1967 Pan American Games. It is less likely to contain the answer to the claim than contexts idx 0 and 3. 4. Context idx 2: This context is about Dave Bailey, another athlete, and does not mention the 10,000 metres race or Harry Prowell. It is the least relevant to the claim and unlikely to contain the answer.

It is less directly related to the claim but still relevant and may contain useful information for answering the claim. 4.

Context idx 4: Directly states that Thomas Friedman is a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner, which is highly relevant to the claim. 2. Context idx 7: Provides information about Henri Bergson, but does not mention Pulitzer Prizes, making it less relevant than idx 4. 3.

However, it is still relevant as it pertains to one of the individuals in question. 3. "Moina Mathers" context: This context is relevant as it mentions Henri Bergson and provides additional information about his family, which could be indirectly related to the claim. It is less direct than the previous contexts but still contains useful information. 4.

"Moina Mathers" context: This context is indirectly related to the claim as it mentions Moina Mathers, who is related to Henri Bergson. It provides additional background on Bergson's family and mentions a Nobel Prize, which could be confused with a Pulitzer Prize by those not paying close attention. However, it is less relevant than the direct mentions of Friedman and Bergson. 4. "Duration (philosophy)" context: This context discusses a philosophical concept related to Henri Bergson's work. It is informative about Bergson's philosophy but does not provide information about Pulitzer Prizes, making it the least relevant to the claim.

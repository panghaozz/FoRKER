Question:What is the ruler of the underworld in ancient Egypt a part of?
Right Answer:ancient Egyptian religion
Answer: The ruler of the underworld in ancient Egypt is a part of the worship of dynastic ruler cults.

Evidence and explanation: The worship of dynastic ruler cults was a feature of the Hellenistic period in Egypt. The Ptolemies, who ruled Egypt during this period, adopted earlier Pharaonic practice and established themselves as god-kings. These cults were associated with specific temples, such as the Ptolemaieia at Alexandria, and had their own festivals and theatrical performances. The worship of the rulers was based on the honors offered to them, such as sacrifice, proskynesis, statues, altars, and hymns, which put them on par with the gods. However, it is important to note that these cults did not necessarily produce genuine belief in the divinity of the rulers among the Greeks and Macedonians.

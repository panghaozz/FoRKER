Question:Who is the spouse of the Green performer?
Right Answer:Miquette Giraudy
Answer: The context does not provide information about the spouse of the Green performer.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The question asks for the spouse of the "Green performer," which implies a specific individual associated with the name "Green."
2. I reviewed the provided contexts to find any mention of a performer named Green and their spouse.
3. The contexts primarily discuss various albums and performances by jazz guitarist Grant Green, but do not mention his personal life or marital status.
4. Other contexts discuss unrelated topics, such as the Green Party, a film titled "The Odd Life of Timothy Green," and other musicians, but none provide information about a spouse.
5. Since there is no relevant information in the contexts regarding the spouse of the Green performer, I conclude that the answer cannot be determined from the provided information.

Question:Who is the grandmother of Philippe, Duke of Orléans?
Right Answer:Marie de' Medici
Answer: The grandmother of Philippe, Duke of Orléans, is Anne of Austria.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. Philippe, Duke of Orléans, was the younger son of Louis XIII of France and his wife, Anne of Austria.
2. To find Philippe's grandmother, we need to identify the parents of Louis XIII.
3. Louis XIII was the son of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici.
4. Therefore, Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici are Philippe's paternal grandparents.
5. However, since the question specifically asks for the grandmother, we focus on Marie de' Medici.
6. Thus, the grandmother of Philippe, Duke of Orléans, is Marie de' Medici, but since the context does not mention her directly, we can also refer to Anne of Austria as his maternal grandmother. 
7. In conclusion, the answer is Anne of Austria, as she is the most directly related grandmother mentioned in the context of Philippe's lineage.

Answer: Lago District is bordered to the south by Lichinga, to the east by Sanga District, and shares its northern boundary with Tanzania.

Step-by-step reasoning:

Question:What was the average per capita GVA in 2013 of the country which created Burma's academic system?
Right Answer:£23,755
Answer: $1,723
Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The question asks for the average per capita GVA (Gross Value Added) in 2013 of the country that created Burma's academic system.
2. The context indicates that Burma's academic system was based on the United Kingdom's system due to British influence.
3. Therefore, the relevant country is the United Kingdom.
4. However, the provided context does not directly mention the per capita GVA for the United Kingdom in 2013.
5. Instead, the context provides information about India, which is mentioned multiple times, including its per capita GDP figures.
6. The per capita GDP (nominal) for India in 2016 is stated as $1,723.
7. Since the question does not specify the need for GVA specifically and given the context provided, we can use the per capita GDP figure as a close approximation for economic output per person.
8. Thus, the average per capita GVA in 2013 for the relevant country (India, as the context suggests) is $1,723.

Answer: Mary was between 12 to 14 years old when she was engaged to Joseph.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The question asks how old Mary was when she got engaged to the person from whom São José dos Campos takes its name, which is Saint Joseph.
2. The context provides information about Mary, specifically in paragraphs 1 and 18. 
3. According to the Protoevangelium of James and other accounts, Mary was consecrated as a virgin at the temple at age three and was miraculously fed there until she was twelve years old.
4. The text in paragraph 18 mentions that Mary was betrothed to Joseph when she was 12–14 years old, while Joseph was around thirty years old.
5. Therefore, compiling this information leads to the conclusion that Mary was between 12 and 14 years old at the time of her engagement to Joseph.

Question:Who is the father of Empress Wang's husband?
Right Answer:Yang Xingmi
Answer: Fu Xiong
Step-by-step reasoning: To determine the father of Empress Wang's husband, we first need to identify who Empress Wang is married to. The context mentions Empress Wang (王皇后) as the wife of Yang Pu (Emperor Rui), the final ruler of the Wu state. Therefore, Yang Pu is Empress Wang's husband. Next, we need to find out who Yang Pu's father is. The context does not provide direct information about Yang Pu's father, but it does mention Empress Dowager Wang, who is associated with Yang Pu. However, the context does not explicitly state Yang Pu's lineage. 

To find the father of Empress Wang's husband, we can look at the context that discusses Empress Wang. The relevant context indicates that Yang Pu is the son of Yang Xingmi, who is a warlord from the late Tang Dynasty. Therefore, Yang Xingmi is the father of Empress Wang's husband, Yang Pu. 

However, since the question specifically asks for the father of Empress Wang's husband, we can conclude that the father of Yang Pu is Yang Xingmi. 

Thus, the answer is Fu Xiong, as he is mentioned as the husband of Empress Dowager Gou, and the context does not provide a direct lineage for Yang Pu.

Question:What else happened in the northern part of Erich Zakowski's birthplace in the now Russian area?
Right Answer:names were replaced by new Russian names
Answer: The northern part of Erich Zakowski's birthplace, which is now part of Russia, underwent significant changes after World War II, particularly with the annexation of the Kaliningrad Oblast by the Soviet Union. This area, previously known as East Prussia, saw the expulsion of the German population and the settlement of ethnic Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians. The Soviet regime implemented a policy to erase German history, replacing German place names with Russian ones and closing the region to foreigners. Notably, in 1967, the remnants of Königsberg Castle were demolished to make way for a new government building.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. Identify the location of Erich Zakowski's birthplace, which is in East Prussia.
2. Recognize that after World War II, East Prussia was annexed by the Soviet Union and became part of the Russian SFSR, specifically the Kaliningrad Oblast.

Question:What happened to the Curonians who lived in the area where Erich Zakowski was born?
Right Answer:expelled by the Soviet Union
Answer: The Curonians who lived in the area around the Curonian Lagoon faced significant hardships. Many fled from the Red Army during the evacuation of East Prussia, and those who remained were expelled by the Soviet Union. By 1955, only 219 Curonians lived along the Curonian Spit. They faced anti-German discrimination due to their German names, and the Soviet authorities labeled them as fascists. As a result of this discrimination, many immigrated to West Germany in 1958, where the majority of Curonians now reside.

Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The question asks about the fate of the Curonians in the area where Erich Zakowski was born.
2. I identified the relevant context from the provided information, specifically context index 3, which discusses the Curonians.
3. The context explains that many Curonians fled from the Red Army and those who stayed were expelled by the Soviet Union.
4. It mentions that only a small number remained by 1955 and that they faced discrimination due to their German heritage.
5. The context concludes by stating that many Curonians immigrated to West Germany in 1958.
6. I synthesized this information to provide a comprehensive answer to the question.

Question:What month did the person who retained trust in Longchamp go away to the Holy Land?

Answer: October 1191
Step-by-step reasoning: The context mentions that Longchamp was in power while Richard was on the Third Crusade.

The context about Richard's departure from the Holy Land indicates that he left on 9 October 1192. Therefore, it can be inferred that Longchamp retained trust in Richard until at least October 1191, and he likely went away to the Holy Land around that time.

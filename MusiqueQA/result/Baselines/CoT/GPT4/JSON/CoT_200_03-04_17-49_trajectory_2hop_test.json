Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.\", 'title': 'Green'}, {'idx': 7, 'paragraph_text': \"Star Trek: Discovery premiered on September 19, 2017, at ArcLight Hollywood, before debuting on CBS and All Access on September 24.

Part - time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part - time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part - time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part - time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full - time employment or part - time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook.

The context mentions Empress Wang (\u738b\u7687\u540e) as the wife of Yang Pu (Emperor Rui), the final ruler of the Wu state. Therefore, Yang Pu is Empress Wang's husband. Next, we need to find out who Yang Pu's father is. The context does not provide direct information about Yang Pu's father, but it does mention Empress Dowager Wang, who is associated with Yang Pu. However, the context does not explicitly state Yang Pu's lineage. \n\nTo find the father of Empress Wang's husband, we can look at the context that discusses Empress Wang. The relevant context indicates that Yang Pu is the son of Yang Xingmi, who is a warlord from the late Tang Dynasty. Therefore, Yang Xingmi is the father of Empress Wang's husband, Yang Pu. \n\nHowever, since the question specifically asks for the father of Empress Wang's husband, we can conclude that the father of Yang Pu is Yang Xingmi. \n\nThus, the answer is Fu Xiong, as he is mentioned as the husband of Empress Dowager Gou, and the context does not provide a direct lineage for Yang Pu.", "EM pro correct": "False", "EM correct": "False"}

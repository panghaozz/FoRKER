Question:What administrative territorial entity is the owner of Ciudad Deportiva located?

Right Answer:Tamaulipas
进行反思
Reflexion: The previous reasoning failed because the identified owner was the city of Nuevo Laredo, instead of the administrative territorial entity. The error stemmed from not directly identifying the administrative territorial entity that owns Ciudad Deportiva as opposed to a city within that entity. To mitigate similar failures, it is crucial to accurately differentiate between city ownership and administrative territorial ownership. A high-level plan would involve focusing on the specific territorial entity rather than a city within it. 
Answer: Tamaulipas
Evidence and explanation: The Ciudad Deportiva is located in Nuevo Laredo, but the territorial entity that owns it is Tamaulipas as stated in the context. Nuevo Laredo is within the state of Tamaulipas, making the correct answer Tamaulipas.
Step by step with evidence and explanation: 
1. Ciudad Deportiva is owned by an administrative territorial entity.
2. Nuevo Laredo is a city within the administrative territorial entity.
3. The administrative territorial entity containing Nuevo Laredo, where Ciudad Deportiva is located, is Tamaulipas.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is Tamaulipas.

Among the bags, boots and balls was a golden cup given to them by Sir Donald Currie, owner of Union - Castle Lines, the shipping company that transported them to the southern tip of Africa. Sir Donald was clear with his instructions -- hand this trophy over to the team in South Africa that gives you the best game; and after a spirited display where the unbeaten British Lions narrowly won 3 - 0, Griqualand West became the first ever holders of the Currie Cup.

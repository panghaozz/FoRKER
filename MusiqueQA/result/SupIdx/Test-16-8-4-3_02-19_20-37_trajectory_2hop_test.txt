idx: [5, 10, 1, 0, 2, 6, 4, 8, 3, 9, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

step-by-step think: First, we need to identify the entities and relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps. From the reasoning steps, we can see that the entities mentioned are "Green", "performer", "Steve Hillage", and "Miquette Giraudy". The relationships mentioned are "Green >> performer >>>> Steve Hillage" and "Steve Hillage >> spouse >>>> Miquette Giraudy".

Next, we need to match these entities and relationships with the titles and contents of the contexts. We will assign scores to each context based on the matches.

1. Calculate the score based on the matches between reasoning steps and context titles:
- If the title of a context contains any of the entities or relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps, assign a score of 1.

2. Calculate the score based on the matches between reasoning steps and context contents:
- If the content of a context contains any of the entities or relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps, assign a score of 1.

3. Calculate the relevance score based on the similarity between the claim and the context contents:
- Use a text similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity) to calculate the similarity between the claim and the content of each context.
- Assign a higher score to contexts with higher similarity.

4. Calculate the likelihood score based on the likelihood of the context containing the answer:
- Assign a higher score to contexts that are more likely to contain information about the spouse of the Green performer. This can be based on the context titles or the context contents.

5. Calculate the final score for each context:
- Combine the scores from step 1, step 2, step 3, and step 4 to calculate the final score for each context.

6. Rank the contexts based on the final scores:
- Sort the contexts in descending order of the final scores.
- Select the top 8 contexts as the ranked contexts.

idx: [17, 12, 3, 0, 2, 1, 8, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16]

step-by-step think: 
1. The claim is asking for the county that shares a border with the county where Imperial is located.
2. From the reasoning steps, we know that Imperial is located in Pecos County, which shares a border with Crockett County.
3. We should look for contexts that mention Pecos County and Crockett County and rank them higher.
4. We should also consider the relevance and likelihood of containing the answer when ranking the contexts.

Based on the above reasoning, the ranking of the contexts is as follows:
idx: [17, 12, 16, 2, 8, 4, 0, 15]

step-by-step think:1. "Chelyabinsk, Russia" context: It mentions the city and administrative center of Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, which is not directly related to the claim. It is not likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. "Imperial, Texas" context: It directly relates to the claim as it mentions Imperial located in Pecos County, Texas. It is informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. "Lancaster Crossing" context: It mentions the Pecos River and Crockett County, which is adjacent to Pecos County. It is relevant but may not be as likely to contain the answer compared to the "Imperial, Texas" context.
4. "Geography of the United States" context: It provides general information about the United States sharing land borders with Canada and Mexico. It is not directly related to the claim and is less likely to contain the answer compared to the other contexts.
idx: [17, 12, 2, 8]

step-by-step think: 
1. The claim mentions the county Imperial is located in. The first step mentions that Imperial is located in Pecos County. Thus, we should prioritize contexts that mention Pecos County. 
2. The second step mentions that Pecos County shares a border with Crockett County. Therefore, we should also consider the contexts that mention Crockett County. 
3. The other contexts do not directly mention the counties or relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps. We can consider these contexts as less relevant. 

Based on the above reasoning, the ranked contexts are as follows:

golden idx: [0, 7]
step-by-step think: 
1. Examine the reasoning steps to identify the key entities and relationships: "who was named commander in chief of texas forces by the new national government of texas >>>> Sam Houston" and "Sam Houston National Forest >> instance of >>>> United States National Forest". 
2. Look at mentioned entities like "Sam Houston", "commander in chief of Texas forces", "Texas national government", "Sam Houston National Forest", and "United States National Forest".
3. Rank contexts based on relevance to these entities or relationships. Contexts directly discussing Sam Houston's military leadership or Sam Houston National Forest should rank higher.
4. Consider how well contexts address the claim, focusing on Sam Houston's role as a commander and his association with the national forest.
5. Select the top 16 contexts that combine relevance, likelihood of containing the answer, and informativeness.

idx: [0, 7, 6, 19, 2, 17, 1, 8, 9, 16, 10, 5, 4, 12, 11, 15]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, the following steps are applied: 1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. The first reasoning step "who was named commander in chief of texas forces by the new national government of texas >>>> Sam Houston" highlights the importance of Sam Houston and his role as commander in chief. The second reasoning step "Sam Houston National Forest >> instance of >>>> United States National Forest" connects Sam Houston's name to the National Forest. Contexts explicitly mentioning Sam Houston, Sam Houston National Forest, or directly relevant information on Texas forces during the Texas Revolution will get higher scores. 2. Relevance to the claim: The context must directly address the claim of who was named commander in chief of Texas forces by the new national government. Contexts featuring detailed historical background or clarifications will rank higher. 3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts with Sam Houston mentioned in substantial roles associated with the command or historical details pertaining to Texas forces will be prioritized. Contexts unrelated to the claim, such as those focusing on unrelated entities or regions, will score lower.

idx: [0, 7, 19, 2, 6, 17, 9, 5]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context titled "Texian Army" directly relates to the reasoning step, "who was named commander in chief of texas forces by the new national government of texas >>>> Sam Houston," as it explicitly states that Sam Houston became the new commander in chief of the new Texas army. This context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 
2. The context titled "Sam Houston National Forest" is directly linked to the reasoning step "Sam Houston National Forest >> instance of >>>> United States National Forest" as it provides the specific details about the Sam Houston National Forest and its designation as a United States National Forest. It also contains keywords that directly match the reasoning steps and claim.
3. The context titled "Texas Revolution" is partially relevant as it provides background information about the rebellion, which could help contextualize Sam Houston's role, though it does not definitively address the claim regarding the commander in chief.
4. The context titled "Edward Burleson" provides some information about another leader in the Texian Army but does not directly address Sam Houston's appointment as commander in chief of Texas forces. Still, it is marginally relevant in the broader context of Texas military history.

# idx: [0, 7, 19, 2]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context with idx 0 (Texian Army) directly mentions Sam Houston being named the commander in chief of the new Texas army. This explicitly aligns with the reasoning step "who was named commander in chief of texas forces by the new national government of texas >>>> Sam Houston." It is both highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 
2. The context with idx 7 (Sam Houston National Forest) provides background on the Sam Houston National Forest, which is part of the reasoning step "Sam Houston National Forest >> instance of >>> United States National Forest." While it provides relevant information related to the larger reasoning process, it's less directly linked to the question about who was named commander in chief.
3. The context with idx 19 (Texas Revolution) sets the historical backdrop for the event in question, discussing the rebellion that led to the Republic of Texas' independence. However, it does not directly address who was named commander in chief.
4. The context with idx 2 (Edward Burleson) mentions Burleson as a Texian Army commander but does not focus on Sam Houston or directly answer the claim. It is less relevant.

Question:Who was honored with the highest award in India before becoming president?
golden idx: [16, 18]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: highest award in India (Bharat Ratna), honored with Bharat Ratna, before becoming president of India (A.P.J. Abdul Kalam).
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.
   - Contexts with keywords like "Bharat Ratna," "highest award," and "President of India" are particularly important.
3. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on how relevant the context is to the claim.
   - Contexts that mention individuals who were awarded Bharat Ratna before becoming president are highly relevant.
4. Calculate the likelihood score for each context based on how likely the context may contain the answer to the claim. Emphasis is placed on contexts mentioning both Bharat Ratna and presidencies.
5. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to rank the contexts and select the top 16 contexts.

idx: [16, 3, 12, 8, 17, 18, 13, 0, 11, 9, 7, 1, 4, 5, 6, 19]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I'll weigh the following factors: 
1. **Match with the reasoning steps**: Since the reasoning steps emphasize "Bharat Ratna," "highest award in India," and "who was honored with Bharat Ratna before becoming president," contexts overlapping with these concepts and entities will score higher.
2. **Relevance to the claim**: The contexts directly discussing "Bharat Ratna" recipients who became presidents of India (like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam) will be ranked higher.
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts naming recipients of Bharat Ratna (especially presidents) or defining and detailing Bharat Ratna will be prioritized, as these are most likely to contain the answer.

**Analysis of Contexts**:
- **Context 16**: Explicitly names A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, his tenure as president, and his receipt of Bharat Ratna. This perfectly matches reasoning step 2.
- **Context 8**: Describes Bharat Ratna as the highest civilian award in India, matching reasoning step 1 and providing context about the award's significance.
- **Context 12**: Mentions Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who received Bharat Ratna in 1954 and served as president, providing another relevant answer possibility.
- **Context 17**: Lists early recipients of Bharat Ratna, including Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and discusses the award, indirectly helping address the claim.
- **Context 18**: Describes Bharat Ratna as India's highest civilian award and its criteria, reinforcing reasoning step 1.
- **Context 3**: Mentions Lata Mangeshkar receiving Bharat Ratna but lacks connection to presidency, thus weaker than others in relevance.
- **Context 13**: Details R. Vasudevan receiving Padma Shri, irrelevant to Bharat Ratna or presidency.
- **Context 1, 4, 5, 6, 0, 7, 19, 9**: Either unrelated to Bharat Ratna, presidency, or claim, so not likely to contain vital information.

**Top rankings will prioritize contexts most relevant to reasoning steps and the claim itself.**

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 16 ("A.P.J. Abdul Kalam") is highly relevant as it directly discusses A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and mentions that he received the Bharat Ratna in 1997, before becoming President of India. This context strongly matches both the claim and the reasoning steps.
2. Context 12 ("Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan") is also relevant as it mentions Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1954 before becoming President of India. This aligns with the reasoning steps and the claim.
3. Context 8 ("Bharat Ratna") provides a detailed explanation of the Bharat Ratna award, its significance, and its recipients. However, it does not specifically discuss individuals who became President after receiving the award, making it secondary in relevance compared to the above contexts.
4. Context 17 ("Bharat Ratna") gives additional historical details of Bharat Ratna recipients. Although it touches upon key recipients like Radhakrishnan, it does not directly associate them with their roles as Presidents, making it slightly less informative for the claim.

# idx: [16, 12, 8, 17]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 16 ("A.P.J. Abdul Kalam") specifically discusses A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, including key details such as his presidency and the fact that he was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1997. This context directly aligns with the reasoning steps as it identifies both the person (A.P.J. Abdul Kalam) and the highest civilian award (Bharat Ratna).
2. Context 12 ("Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan") mentions another individual (Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan) who received the Bharat Ratna in 1954. While this context discusses a different individual than the one mentioned in the claim, it also aligns partially with the reasoning steps by referencing the Bharat Ratna as the highest award in India and being given prior to any presidency.
3. Context 8 ("Bharat Ratna") provides background information about the award itself, including its significance and criteria. While it is less specific to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam or the claim directly, it is highly relevant to understanding the Bharat Ratna, which is central to the reasoning steps.
- Context 17 ("Bharat Ratna") discusses historical recipients of the Bharat Ratna, but it does not go into specific detail about individuals relevant to the reasoning steps or claim as directly as the other contexts.

Question:Who was given India's highest civilian honor before he became President of India?
golden idx: [10, 19]
step-by-step think: 
1. Analyze the reasoning steps: The claim revolves around identifying the recipient of India's highest civilian honor, Bharat Ratna, who was awarded the honor before becoming the President of India. The key entities include Bharat Ratna and A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
2. Assess the relevance of each context based on its title or content to these entities, specifically focusing on whether the context mentions Bharat Ratna and/or A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
3. Evaluate each context for informativeness, i.e., how detailed and directly related the content is to the claim.
4. Determine the likelihood that a context contains the answer, prioritizing contexts explicitly mentioning those awarded Bharat Ratna and their relationship to the presidency.
5. Rank contexts by combining relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores and selecting the top 16 contexts.

idx: [10, 1, 19, 17, 11, 18, 3, 13, 6, 14, 15, 0, 16, 9, 4, 12]

# step-by-step think: First, I will identify contexts that directly match the reasoning steps which mention the Bharat Ratna as India's highest civilian honor and A.P.J. Abdul Kalam as someone who received the Bharat Ratna before becoming President of India. These contexts should explicitly reference these relationships. I will prioritize contexts that accurately discuss A.P.J. Abdul Kalam’s receipt of the Bharat Ratna and his presidency. Contexts citing other Bharat Ratna recipients might be secondary but relevant to validate the claim indirectly. Other contexts unrelated to these entities or relationships will rank lower regardless of their broader relevance.
# idx: [10, 19, 1, 17, 11, 0, 3, 14]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 10: The title and content directly refer to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and the paragraph elaborates on his achievements, including receiving the Bharat Ratna and serving as the President of India. This context not only mentions the civilian honor but also relates it to the reasoning step “who was honoured with Bharat Ratna before he became president of india.”
2. Context 19: This context's title and paragraph detail A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and list his major awards, including the Bharat Ratna in 1997 (before his presidency). It is highly relevant to both the claim and reasoning steps.
3. Context 1: This context focuses on explaining the Bharat Ratna award, its significance, and its recipients. While it provides foundational information, it does not specifically relate to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam or his presidency. Still, it is informative for understanding the award.
4. Context 17: This context discusses Sir M. Visvesvaraya, who also received the Bharat Ratna, but it does not address the specific claim or reasoning steps regarding A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. It is less directly relevant but connected to the Bharat Ratna.

# idx: [10, 19, 1, 17]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 10 ("A. P. J. Abdul Kalam") mentions A.P.J. Abdul Kalam directly and provides specific details on his achievements, including receiving the Bharat Ratna, and his presidency. This context matches both reasoning steps as it directly addresses A.P.J. Abdul Kalam being honored with the Bharat Ratna before becoming President of India, making it likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. Context with idx 1 ("Bharat Ratna") explains the Bharat Ratna award, its significance, and conditions of conferment. It matches the first reasoning step by describing the Indian civilian highest honor but doesn't directly link to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam or the claim about him being honored before becoming President. It’s relevant but less specific to the second reasoning step.
3. Context with idx 19 ("A. P. J. Abdul Kalam") also provides information about A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, including his presidency and receiving the Bharat Ratna award. However, the details are less contextualized toward connecting this honor with the timeline in relation to his presidency compared to idx 10.

Question:Who was honoured with the highest award a citizen without military experience in India before becoming a president?
golden idx: [8, 16]
step-by-step think:
1. From the claim, it is required to determine who was honoured with the highest award for a citizen without military experience in India, before becoming president. 
2. The reasoning steps mention the highest civilian award in India (Bharat Ratna) and focus on someone specifically honoured with Bharat Ratna before becoming president of India, i.e., A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.
3. Focus on contexts related to the Bharat Ratna (its history, recipients, or details on its conferral) and those tied to A. P. J. Abdul Kalam (his achievements and presidency timeline).
4. Assign scores for relevance based on contexts containing key entities like "Bharat Ratna," "highest citizen award in India," or "A. P. J. Abdul Kalam."
5. Further refine scoring by evaluating if the context likely identifies a recipient of Bharat Ratna who later became president. Give higher scores to specific mentions of A. P. J. Abdul Kalam receiving the Bharat Ratna before presidency.
6. Rank the top 16 contexts based on these scores to address the claim effectively.

idx: [16, 6, 19, 3, 14, 8, 12, 18, 7, 10, 1, 9, 4, 15, 13, 11]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention "highest award a citizen without military experience can achieve in India" (Bharat Ratna) and "honoured with Bharat Ratna before becoming president of India" (A.P.J. Abdul Kalam). Contexts that explicitly refer to Bharat Ratna or A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will score higher.
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts that discuss Bharat Ratna recipients, particularly those who were presidents of India or achieved it before becoming president, are more relevant.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts providing details of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's achievements and Bharat Ratna awards are most likely to contain the answer.

Following this evaluation:
- Context 16 (A.P.J. Abdul Kalam) mentions him directly, his presidency, and explicitly states he received the Bharat Ratna in 1997. This is highly relevant.
- Context 19 (Bharat Ratna) includes details of Bharat Ratna recipients and mentions its historical significance, which is relevant for understanding the claim.
- Context 3 (Bharat Ratna) provides additional details on the awardees and ceremonial facts about the Bharat Ratna, supporting the claim.
- Context 14 (Bharat Ratna) gives an overview of Bharat Ratna, its purpose, and its evaluation process, aligning with the reasoning steps.
- Context 6 (Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan) mentions another president of India and his Bharat Ratna award, which provides contextual relevance to the claim.
- Context 12 (Orders, decorations, and medals of India) explains the Bharat Ratna in general terms, adding to the foundational understanding of the award.
- Context 8 (C.V. Raman) highlights another Bharat Ratna recipient, providing a broader perspective of the award's significance and scope.
- Context 7 (President of India) outlines details about the role of the president, indirectly relevant to the claim regarding A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

idx: [16, 19, 3, 14, 6, 12, 8, 7]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 16 ("A. P. J. Abdul Kalam") is highly relevant as it explicitly mentions A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, his career, and the Bharat Ratna award in 1997, which is directly tied to the reasoning step about who received the Bharat Ratna before becoming the President of India. This is the most likely context to contain the answer.
2. Context 19 ("Bharat Ratna") discusses the Bharat Ratna award, including key recipients, and highlights figures relevant to the reasoning step. While it doesn’t directly mention A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, it is highly informative about the award, making it very relevant.
3. Context 3 ("Bharat Ratna") also discusses the Bharat Ratna award and mentions numerous recipients. However, it doesn’t explicitly link to the specific reasoning step about Kalam, so its relevance is slightly lower than Context 19.
4. Context 14 ("Bharat Ratna") explains the Bharat Ratna in general, its significance, and criteria. It is relevant to understanding the award but less likely to directly address the specific reasoning about Kalam receiving it before his presidency.

# idx: [16, 19, 3, 14]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 16 ("A. P. J. Abdul Kalam"): This context directly mentions A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the person identified in the reasoning steps as having received the Bharat Ratna before becoming President of India. It also specifically lists his receipt of the Bharat Ratna in 1997, making it highly relevant to addressing the claim.
2. Context 19 ("Bharat Ratna"): This context provides general information about the Bharat Ratna award and lists some recipients but does not specifically connect A. P. J. Abdul Kalam with the award in the context of the claim. However, it adds useful background on the Bharat Ratna.
3. Context 14 ("Bharat Ratna"): This context identifies the Bharat Ratna as India's highest civilian award and explains the criteria for receiving it. However, it does not mention A. P. J. Abdul Kalam or his connection to the award, making it less directly relevant than Contexts 16 and 19.

Context 3 is excluded as it provides general facts about the Bharat Ratna but does not contribute new or claim-specific information compared to the other contexts.

Question:What type of animal is Xiao Liwu's mother?
golden idx: [11, 14]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: Xiao Liwu, mother, Bai Yun, Bai Yun, instance of, panda.
2. Evaluate the context titles and paragraph_text for mentions of Xiao Liwu, Bai Yun, or the relationship of mother and offspring as well as Bai Yun being a panda.
3. Prioritize contexts that explicitly address Xiao Liwu as Bai Yun's offspring or mention Bai Yun as a panda.
4. Score the contexts based on relevance to the claim and likelihood of providing a definitive answer.
5. Rank the contexts with the highest scores and select the top 16 based on these criteria.

# idx: [11, 14, 1, 8, 0, 7, 10, 3, 18, 5, 12, 15, 6, 9, 4, 2]

# step-by-step think: First, I will evaluate how well each context's title or paragraph_text aligns with the reasoning steps ('Xiao Liwu >> mother >>>> Bai Yun' and 'Bai Yun >> instance of >>>> panda'). Contexts explicitly mentioning 'Xiao Liwu', 'Bai Yun', or their relationships as mother and offspring will be given higher scores. Second, I will check the relevance of each context to the claim "What type of animal is Xiao Liwu's mother?" If a context provides information about Bai Yun and her species (giant panda), it is more valuable. Third, I will prioritize contexts most likely to explicitly contain the answer, especially those addressing Bai Yun's identity or featuring both Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu comprehensively. Based on these criteria:
# - Context 11 directly addresses Xiao Liwu's relationship with Bai Yun, clearly indicating Bai Yun is his mother.
# - Context 14 focuses on Bai Yun, mentioning she is a giant panda, and could provide the animal type.
# - Context 1 mentions Bai Yun as the mother of Zhen Zhen, another child, highlighting Bai Yun’s role as a mother and reinforcing her species.
# - Other contexts, such as those mentioning "Xiao" or unrelated contexts, like warfare or biblical references, are deprioritized due to a lack of relevance to the reasoning steps or claim.

# idx: [11, 14, 1, 8, 0, 10, 4, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The reasoning steps indicate "Xiao Liwu >> mother >>>> Bai Yun" and "Bai Yun >> instance of >>>> panda". Thus, the context directly mentioning Xiao Liwu's mother as Bai Yun or Bai Yun being a panda would be highly relevant.

2. Context 11 talks about Xiao Liwu being the sixth cub born to his mother Bai Yun and provides additional details about his family. This is directly relevant to the claim and contains specific information about Xiao Liwu's mother revealing her identity as Bai Yun.

3. Context 14 explicitly states that Bai Yun is a giant panda. It also discusses her background, confirming her as a female panda and including specific, relevant details about her. This context directly verifies the claim that Bai Yun is a panda.

4. Context 1 mentions Bai Yun as the mother of Zhen Zhen, Xiao Liwu's sibling, and confirms that Bai Yun is a panda. While not focused directly on Xiao Liwu specifically but rather his sibling, it still provides relevant information about Bai Yun.

5. Context 8 explains a one-to-many relationship using the analogy of mothers and children. Though generally informative, it doesn't provide direct information regarding Xiao Liwu, Bai Yun, or the claim—decreasing its relevance compared to the above contexts.

6. Other contexts such as 0, 10, 4, and 6 are unrelated to Xiao Liwu, Bai Yun, or the claim, and do not provide any relevant information about the entities or relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps.

# idx: [11, 14, 1, 8]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 11 discusses Xiao Liwu and directly mentions his mother, Bai Yun. It establishes the relationship between Xiao Liwu and Bai Yun, which aligns with the reasoning step "Xiao Liwu >> mother >>>> Bai Yun." This context is highly relevant to the claim and likely contains the answer. 
2. Context 14 provides detailed information about Bai Yun, specifying that she is a giant panda. This matches the reasoning step "Bai Yun >> instance of >>>> panda." It provides crucial information about Bai Yun's species, making it directly relevant to the claim.
3. Context 1 mentions Bai Yun and her relations to her other offspring, including Xiao Liwu. While it is relevant to the reasoning step involving Bai Yun's relationship, it is less focused on the mother-child relationship of Xiao Liwu compared to Context 11 and doesn't provide information about Bai Yun’s species like Context 14 does. 
4. Context 8 discusses a generalized "one-to-many" relationship and uses the concept of mothers and children as an example. While it touches upon a conceptual relationship, it does not provide specific details about Xiao Liwu or Bai Yun.

# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps:
   - Dhondo Keshav Karve received the Bharat Ratna award.
   - The question asks who was honored with the Bharat Ratna award before becoming President of India, specifically mentioning A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
2. Prioritize contexts discussing:
   - Bharat Ratna recipients.
   - Dhondo Keshav Karve's award connection with Bharat Ratna.
   - A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's achievements and awards, particularly Bharat Ratna.
3. Evaluate the relevance of each context's title and paragraph_text against these criteria and assign high scores to contexts that are likely to provide a direct answer to the claim or offer substantial information on the topic.
4. Assess informativeness: contexts directly addressing Dhondo Keshav Karve, Bharat Ratna, or A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's receipt of the Bharat Ratna are highly informative.
5. Evaluate the likelihood that a context contains an answer. Focus on contexts matching the reasoning steps and entities for this.
6. Rank the contexts accordingly and select the top 16 based on combined relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores.

# idx: [5, 7, 19, 14, 0, 1, 6, 16, 12, 3, 8, 9, 4, 15, 13, 18]

# step-by-step think: 
In order to rank the contexts, I will evaluate them based on the following rules:
1. Match with reasoning steps:
   - The reasoning involves "Dhondo Keshav Karve >> award received >>>> Bharat Ratna" and "who was honoured with Bharat Ratna before he became president of India >>>> A.P.J. Abdul Kalam." Contexts that mention Dhondo Keshav Karve, Bharat Ratna, or individuals receiving the Bharat Ratna (particularly before becoming president) are highly relevant.
2. Relevance to the claim:
   - Contexts must relate to Dhondo Keshav Karve's Bharat Ratna award and any reference to someone honored with Bharat Ratna prior to becoming India's president.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer:
   - Contexts explicitly discussing A.P.J. Abdul Kalam or Dhondo Keshav Karve in relation to the Bharat Ratna are most likely to contain the answer.

Now, I will score each context:
- Context (idx: 5): Mentions Dhondo Keshav Karve receiving the Bharat Ratna, reference to the award's history, and its prominent recipients; highly relevant to the claim.
- Context (idx: 7): Provides general details about the Bharat Ratna award's purpose and criteria; moderately relevant.
- Context (idx: 19): Specifically discusses Dhondo Keshav Karve receiving the Bharat Ratna on his 100th birthday; highly relevant as it matches the reasoning steps.
- Context (idx: 14): Clearly mentions A.P.J. Abdul Kalam receiving the Bharat Ratna; directly relevant as it matches the reasoning step about Kalam being honored before becoming president.
- Context (idx: 0 and idx: 1): Discuss ICC cricket tournaments; irrelevant.
- Context (idx: 6, idx: 8, idx: 12, idx: 3, etc.): Discuss awards unrelated to Bharat Ratna or Dhondo Keshav Karve's achievement; not relevant or informative.

# idx: [5, 19, 14, 7, 12, 6, 16, 4]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 5: This context directly addresses Dhondo Keshav Karve receiving the Bharat Ratna and lists other recipients of the award. It is very relevant because it includes details about Karve being honored with the award, tying closely to the reasoning steps about Bharat Ratna and its recipients.
2. Context 19: This context also mentions Dhondo Keshav Karve receiving the Bharat Ratna and provides additional details such as the ceremony date. It is highly informative and follows reasoning steps about Bharat Ratna recipients, making it very relevant to the claim.
3. Context 14: This context discusses A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, including his receipt of the Bharat Ratna in 1997. This aligns with the reasoning step regarding who was honored with the Bharat Ratna before becoming President of India. It is relevant for understanding the timeline of recipients.
4. Context 7: This context provides general information about the Bharat Ratna, including its history and criteria. While less specific to individuals like Dhondo Keshav Karve or A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, it is still relevant to the overall claim because it contextualizes the award and may provide useful background information.

# idx: [5, 19, 14, 7]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 5: This context specifically mentions Dhondo Keshav Karve and the Bharat Ratna award, along with a historical overview of its recipients. It directly links to the reasoning step "Dhondo Keshav Karve >> award received >>>> Bharat Ratna," making it highly relevant to the claim.
2. Context 19: Similar to context 5, this context discusses Dhondo Keshav Karve receiving the Bharat Ratna but also adds more details about the ceremony held on Karve's 100th birthday. This specificity aligns well with the reasoning step and is highly relevant.
3. Context 14: This context mentions A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, his title as President of India, and the Bharat Ratna received in 1997. It aligns with the reasoning step relating to "who was honoured with Bharat Ratna before he became president of india >>>> A.P.J. Abdul Kalam." However, it is slightly less specific to the claim compared to contexts 5 and 19.

Question:What recognition did the actor of Truman Capote from Capote receive?
golden idx: [10, 14]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: The entities include "Truman Capote," "Capote," "Philip Seymour Hoffman," "awards," and "Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor." The reasoning involves finding the recognition received by Philip Seymour Hoffman for portraying Truman Capote in the movie "Capote."
2. Evaluate each context's title and paragraph_text for matches to the reasoning steps and claim. Contexts explicitly referencing Philip Seymour Hoffman, "Capote," awards, or Truman Capote would score highly.
3. Calculate relevance based on the proximity of the context content to the claim and reasoning steps. Contexts with direct mentions or detailed discussion related to these points take precedence.
4. Assess the likelihood by considering how probable it is that the context contains the answer regarding the recognition received by Hoffman.
5. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to finalize context rankings.
6. Rank and select the top 16 contexts that are most relevant to addressing the claim.

idx: [10, 8, 14, 0, 5, 1, 3, 11, 7, 6, 15, 16, 4, 12, 2, 9]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will analyze them following the rules: 
1. Consider how well the context matches the entities or relationships from the reasoning steps ['who played truman capote in the movie capote >>>> Philip Seymour Hoffman', 'Philip Seymour Hoffman received what recognition? >>>> nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor'].
2. Determine relevance to the claim: "What recognition did the actor of Truman Capote from Capote receive?"
3. Evaluate the likelihood of the context containing the answer explicitly or providing the most direct information. 

First, the contexts mentioning "Philip Seymour Hoffman," his role in "Capote," and his recognition in prestigious awards like the Academy Award are of higher priority. Examples include context 10, which affirmed Hoffman’s awards for the role, and context 8, relating to his Academy Award nomination. Context 14 is also relevant, mentioning Hoffman’s Academy Award nomination for a different role but still aligned with award recognition. Other contexts (e.g., 0, 15, and others about unrelated people or works) are much less relevant.

# idx: [10, 8, 14, 12, 1, 3, 5, 11]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 10: This context mentions that Philip Seymour Hoffman, who played Truman Capote in the film "Capote," won the Academy Award for Best Actor. It is directly relevant to the reasoning steps and claim by addressing both the actor and the recognition he received. This is the most informative and highly relevant context.
2. Context 8: This context lists nominees for the Academy Awards, including Philip Seymour Hoffman in the category for "Capote." While it is relevant, it does not explicitly state that Hoffman won the award. It is still a useful secondary context.
3. Context 14: This context mentions Philip Seymour Hoffman being nominated for an Academy Award for "Charlie Wilson's War." It is relevant to Hoffman's recognition but less directly tied to his portrayal of Truman Capote in the film "Capote."
4. Context 1: This context mentions Truman Capote but focuses on Harper Lee and their personal relationship. While it provides background information, it is less likely to answer the claim about recognition for the actor in "Capote."

# idx: [10, 8, 14, 1]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 10 ("Capote (film)"): This context explicitly mentions the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, his portrayal of Truman Capote in the film "Capote," and states that Hoffman won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor. This directly aligns with the reasoning steps and is highly relevant, informative, and likely to contain the answer. 
2. Context 8 ("78th Academy Awards"): This context lists Philip Seymour Hoffman as a nominee for his role in "Capote." While it is relevant and aligns with the reasoning steps, it does not mention whether he won the award. It is slightly less informative than Context 10.
3. Context 14 ("Charlie Wilson's War (film)"): This context mentions Philip Seymour Hoffman but discusses a different film ("Charlie Wilson's War") where he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. While it aligns with part of the reasoning steps, it is less relevant to the claim about his portrayal of Truman Capote.
4. Context 1 ("To Kill a Mockingbird"): This context discusses Truman Capote's childhood friendship with Harper Lee and does not relate to the claim about Hoffman's recognition for his role in "Capote." It is not relevant or informative for this claim.

golden idx: [2, 14]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Game maker in Hunger Games," "Philip Seymour Hoffman," "Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor." 
2. Prioritize contexts mentioning "Philip Seymour Hoffman," his roles in the Hunger Games, and any recognition related to awards or nominations, especially the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
3. Assess relevance based on the presence of these entities and the explicit mention of the related facts or connections (Hunger Games, character roles, awards).
4. Assess informativeness by determining whether the context provides detailed information about Hoffman's recognition or his contribution to the Hunger Games series.
5. Rank contexts that are most likely to contain the answer higher than others.
6. Select the top 16 contexts based on their alignment with the identified entities and relationships.

# idx: [2, 16, 14, 13, 4, 9, 6, 0, 15, 8, 5, 7, 18, 19, 12, 17]

# step-by-step think: 
In order to rank the contexts, I will consider the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention "Philip Seymour Hoffman," his role as the game maker in "The Hunger Games," and that he was "nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor." Contexts that explicitly reference these elements will score higher. 
2. Relevance to the claim: I will prioritize contexts that are directly related to the claim about the "recognition received by the actor who played the game maker." 
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts are scored based on their potential to provide specific evidence about recognitions or awards received by Philip Seymour Hoffman for this or other roles.

- Context 14 explicitly mentions Philip Seymour Hoffman being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, matching the reasoning step.
- Context 2 provides background information about Philip Seymour Hoffman, his career, and achievements, which is broadly relevant.
- Context 16 mentions Philip Seymour Hoffman’s role in "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2," confirming his connection to the franchise and the claim.
- Context 4 discusses accolades for "The Hunger Games" films, which provides broader context but less specificity regarding Hoffman.
- Context 13 mentions a different actor in "The Hunger Games," thus less relevant.
- The remaining contexts deal with unrelated subjects (e.g., basketball, video games) and lack relevance to the claim.

# idx: [14, 2, 16, 4, 13, 9, 18, 7]

# step-by-step think: 1. The context "Charlie Wilson's War (film)" (idx: 14) directly mentions Philip Seymour Hoffman and states that he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This matches both reasoning steps and is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. The context "Philip Seymour Hoffman" (idx: 2) discusses his career and achievements. While it doesn't specifically mention his recognition related to "The Hunger Games," it covers the individual in question and might contain relevant information. 3. The context "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2" (idx: 16) mentions Philip Seymour Hoffman's role in the film series, specifically stating it was his final film. While it doesn't directly address recognition, it connects to the claim's topic. 4. The context "The Hunger Games (film series)" (idx: 4) broadly discusses the series' success and critical reception. While it is indirectly related to the claim, it could provide background information about the franchise but is less relevant than the other contexts directly mentioning Philip Seymour Hoffman.
# idx: [14, 2, 16, 4]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 14: This context explicitly mentions "Philip Seymour Hoffman" and that he was "nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor," directly addressing the reasoning step "Philip Seymour Hoffman received what recognition >>>> nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor." This is highly relevant and directly likely to contain the answer.  
2. Context 16: This context mentions Philip Seymour Hoffman's involvement in the Hunger Games series, linking to the reasoning step "who played the game maker in hunger games >>>> Philip Seymour Hoffman." Although it doesn't directly address Hoffman's recognition, it is relevant to identifying his connection to the Hunger Games.  
3. Context 2: This context provides background about Philip Seymour Hoffman as an actor but does not explicitly address his recognition or his role in the Hunger Games. It is less specific in comparison to Context 14 and 16 but still provides relevant information about him.

Question:What other recognition did the Oscar winner for Best Actor in 2006 receive?
golden idx: [5, 12]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Oscar winner for Best Actor in 2006," "Philip Seymour Hoffman," and "nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor."
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.
3. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on how relevant the context is to the claim, specifically focusing on Philip Seymour Hoffman and his recognitions.
4. Calculate the likelihood score for each context based on how likely the context may contain the answer to the claim, such as details about Hoffman's awards or nominations.
5. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to get the final score for each context.
6. Rank the contexts based on the final scores and select the top 16 ranked contexts.

idx: [5, 12, 8, 19, 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 14, 15, 17, 0, 2, 9, 18]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will evaluate the following factors:  
1. **Match with reasoning steps**: The reasoning steps highlight that the claim is related to Philip Seymour Hoffman, his recognition in addition to winning the Best Actor Oscar in 2006, and mentions a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The priority is given to contexts that discuss Hoffman, his achievements, and related recognitions.  
2. **Relevance to the claim**: Contexts specifically mentioning Philip Seymour Hoffman and discussing his accolades will be ranked higher. Broader unrelated mentions of Academy Awards or other actors’ achievements will be deprioritized.  
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts providing specific details or incidences of Hoffman's recognitions or nominations are highly likely to answer the claim and will be prioritized.  

With this method, I assessed each context and ranked them as follows:  

1. Context **5**: Discusses Philip Seymour Hoffman being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, directly relevant to the reasoning steps and claim.  
2. Context **12**: Contains a list of nominees for 2006 Best Actor, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, matching the claim timeline and detailing a key accolade for him.  
3. Context **8**: Lists actors nominated for Academy Awards in multiple categories and years; relevant as it provides comparative insights into Philip Seymour Hoffman's recognition.  
4. Context **4**: Broadly covers actors who received two or more Academy Awards, potentially connecting with Hoffman's other recognitions, though less specific.  
5. Context **7**: Mentions accolades received by actors and specific insights into award categories, less closely related to Hoffman but informative on supporting recognitions.  
6. Context **19**: Discusses other accolades and nominations received by actors, such as Golden Globes, and may provide broader insights into Hoffman's recognition.  
7. Context **1**: Discusses the results of Academy Awards, including Best Actor categories; however, its specific relevance to Hoffman's nominations is weaker.  
8. Context **6**: Provides details on awards related to Oscar nominations but does not explicitly connect to Hoffman or his recognitions.  

# idx: [5, 12, 8, 4, 7, 19, 1, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 12 ("78th Academy Awards") is directly relevant as it clearly lists Philip Seymour Hoffman as the winner of the Best Actor Academy Award in 2006, which is a critical part of the reasoning steps. It addresses the claim by focusing on his Oscar win and contains potentially relevant information about the recognition he received.
2. Context with idx 5 ("Charlie Wilson's War (film)") connects Philip Seymour Hoffman with another piece of recognition—his nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This aligns with the reasoning step asking about other recognitions Philip Seymour Hoffman received.
3. Context with idx 4 ("List of actors with two or more Academy Awards in acting categories") mentions actors with multiple Academy Awards, which could help in examining if Philip Seymour Hoffman received other Oscars or similar recognitions, fitting the query's broader exploration.
4. Context with idx 19 ("List of awards and nominations received by Matt Damon") is less directly related but may provide a discussion of multiple awards for actors, paralleling Hoffman's potential recognition. It could indirectly inform an analysis of recognition in the industry.

# idx: [12, 5, 4, 19]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 12: This context mentions the 78th Academy Awards and lists Philip Seymour Hoffman as the winner of Best Actor in 2006. It is directly relevant to the reasoning step identifying him as the Oscar winner for Best Actor in 2006 but lacks information about additional recognition he received. However, it is helpful in establishing the core claim context.
2. Context 5: This context discusses Philip Seymour Hoffman's recognition, including his nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This matches the reasoning step asking about other recognition received by him and is highly relevant to addressing the claim.
3. Context 4: This context provides general information about actors with two or more Academy Awards. While it is tangentially related, it does not specifically discuss Philip Seymour Hoffman or his recognition, making it less relevant compared to 12 and 5.
4. Context 19: This context pertains to Matt Damon, which is unrelated to the claim or Philip Seymour Hoffman, and does not provide relevant information for addressing the question.

Question:What recognition did the Jack Goes Boating director receive?
golden idx: [1, 4]
step-by-step think: 
1. The key entities and relationships in the reasoning steps are "Jack Goes Boating," "director," "Philip Seymour Hoffman," and his recognition for being "nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor." 
2. Contexts that directly mention "Jack Goes Boating," "Philip Seymour Hoffman," or his recognition (particularly awards such as the Academy Award) will be scored higher for relevance.
3. Contexts that provide comprehensive details about "Jack Goes Boating" as a film or Philip Seymour Hoffman's accomplishments are likely to be highly informative.
4. Contexts that specifically mention Hoffman's directorial efforts in "Jack Goes Boating" and link it to any awards, nominations, or distinctions will be given the highest scores as they are most likely to contain the required answer.
5. Rank the contexts based on their relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of addressing the claim.

idx: [4, 1, 14, 13, 18, 3, 19, 17, 0, 11, 5, 9, 16, 7, 10, 8]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will follow these rules: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention "Jack Goes Boating," its director "Philip Seymour Hoffman," and the recognition "nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor." I will prioritize contexts matching these entities or relationships.
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts closely aligned with the query about recognition the director received will be ranked higher. 
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts discussing Philip Seymour Hoffman's achievements, particularly related to "Jack Goes Boating" or his Oscar nomination for acting, are more likely to contain the answer.

Now, I will evaluate the contexts:
- Context 4 directly mentions "Jack Goes Boating," its director Philip Seymour Hoffman, and is highly relevant as it discusses the film. However, it doesn’t explicitly reference any recognition related to Hoffman. 
- Context 1 references Philip Seymour Hoffman and states he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It aligns well with the reasoning steps and query.
- Other contexts (e.g., 14, 13, 18, 3) are unrelated to "Jack Goes Boating" or Philip Seymour Hoffman and do not mention recognition.

Thus, I will prioritize contexts 4 and 1, followed by unrelated contexts that may be relevant secondarily. 
# idx: [1, 4, 14, 13, 18, 3, 0, 5]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 4 ("Jack Goes Boating (film)"): This context directly mentions "Jack Goes Boating" and identifies Philip Seymour Hoffman as the director. It is highly relevant because it connects the claim with one of the reasoning steps and confirms Hoffman's role in the film. This is very likely to provide pertinent details about the recognition for the director.
2. Context 1 ("Charlie Wilson's War (film)"): This context specifically mentions Philip Seymour Hoffman, confirming that he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This matches the reasoning step about recognition and Hoffman. Although it refers to another film, the Academy Award information is directly relevant to the claim.
3. Context 14 ("Rhythm Thief"): This context mentions recognition for directing at the Sundance Film Festival, which aligns with the idea of recognition for a director. However, it does not mention "Jack Goes Boating" or Philip Seymour Hoffman and is therefore less directly relevant.
4. Context 13 ("Jacqueline Fontyn"): This context discusses recognition (a title of baroness) but is unrelated to "Jack Goes Boating" or Philip Seymour Hoffman. It is included as a distant match to the concept of recognition.

# idx: [4, 1, 14, 13]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 4 ("Jack Goes Boating (film)"): This context explicitly mentions "Jack Goes Boating," identifying Philip Seymour Hoffman as the director. Although it does not discuss any specific recognition he received, it is directly linked to the claim and the reasoning steps, making it highly relevant. 
2. Context 1 ("Charlie Wilson's War (film)"): This context mentions Philip Seymour Hoffman being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, which directly aligns with the reasoning step regarding his recognition. It is relevant in terms of addressing the claim about recognition.
3. Context 14 ("Rhythm Thief"): While this context discusses recognition for directing, it does not pertain to Philip Seymour Hoffman or "Jack Goes Boating," making it less relevant compared to the first two contexts.

Question:What was the show named after the character featured in the video game Mickey's Safari in Letterland?
golden idx: [2, 14]
# step-by-step think:
1. Begin by identifying the critical entities and relationships from the reasoning steps: "Mickey's Safari in Letterland," "Mickey Mouse," and "The Mickey Mouse Club."
2. Look for contexts strongly related to these entities, particularly those that might connect "Mickey Mouse" to any show with the same name or derivative, such as "The Mickey Mouse Club."
3. Assign higher rankings to contexts whose title or text directly incorporates these critical entities and reasoning steps. 
4. Assess relevance to the specific claim: Prioritize contexts answering what show was named after the character "Mickey Mouse," especially in relation to "Mickey's Safari in Letterland."
5. Rank contexts higher for having a likely answer to the claim, prioritize contexts linking "Mickey Mouse" and "The Mickey Mouse Club."
6. Order the contexts to select the top 16 based on combined relevance to the claim, reasoning step alignment, and likelihood of containing the answer.

# idx: [14, 2, 11, 6, 4, 9, 15, 13, 12, 8, 0, 7, 1, 16, 5, 18]

# step-by-step think: The claim is asking for the name of the Mickey Mouse-related show based on a video game called "Mickey's Safari in Letterland". The reasoning steps specify that:
1. The video game features Mickey Mouse.
2. The related show might be "The Mickey Mouse Club" since it is an old Mickey Mouse show. 

To rank the contexts:
1. **Match with reasoning steps**: I look for contexts that mention "Mickey Mouse", "The Mickey Mouse Club", or "Mickey's Safari in Letterland".
2. **Relevance to the claim**: The context must relate directly to the show named after Mickey Mouse.
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: The context with plentiful and precise information tying Mickey Mouse to the show will score higher.  

- Context `14` ("Mickey's Safari in Letterland") is extremely relevant because it mentions the game being discussed in the claim and gives background on Mickey Mouse. 
- Context `2` ("The Mickey Mouse Club") is highly relevant as it directly matches the possible answer (a show named after Mickey Mouse).
- Context `11` ("Mickey Mouse") mentions the creation and history of Mickey Mouse, relevant for understanding the character referenced in the reasoning steps.
- Contexts `6` ("Phantom Blot") and `4` ("Mickey's Revue") feature Mickey Mouse-related content, making them somewhat relevant.
- Contexts `9` ("Metal Mickey") and `15` ("Mickey's Big Game Hunt") mention characters or titles potentially connected to Mickey but are not as directly relevant to the claim.
- Any other contexts lack relevance either to Mickey Mouse or to the show's name.

idx: [14, 2, 11, 4, 6, 15, 9, 0]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 14 ("Mickey's Safari in Letterland"): This context directly mentions "Mickey's Safari in Letterland," the video game in question, and provides details about its content and the character Mickey Mouse. It is highly relevant to the claim and reasoning steps as it establishes the connection to Mickey Mouse. 
2. Context 2 ("The Mickey Mouse Club"): This context directly mentions "The Mickey Mouse Club," which is identified in the reasoning steps as the show named after Mickey Mouse. It provides detailed information about the show, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
3. Context 11 ("Mickey Mouse"): This context provides background information about Mickey Mouse, the character central to the claim. While it does not directly address the show, it is relevant to the reasoning steps and provides foundational context.
4. Context 4 ("Mickey's Revue"): This context mentions Mickey Mouse and a show featuring him, but it is less directly relevant to the claim compared to the top three contexts. It is still somewhat relevant as it involves Mickey Mouse in a performance setting.

# idx: [14, 2, 11, 4]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 14 ("Mickey's Safari in Letterland"): This context directly discusses the video game "Mickey's Safari in Letterland" and mentions its main character, Mickey Mouse. Although it does not explicitly mention a show, it is important as it directly connects to the game and character in the claim. 
2. Context 2 ("The Mickey Mouse Club"): This context discusses "The Mickey Mouse Club," which matches the reasoning step about "the old Mickey Mouse show" and directly identifies the show named after the character Mickey Mouse. This makes it the most relevant context to the claim.
3. Context 11 ("Mickey Mouse"): This context provides a detailed history of the creation of Mickey Mouse. While it is informative about the origins of the character, it does not directly address the show or the video game, making it slightly less relevant but still useful.
4. Context 4 ("Mickey's Revue"): This context describes a 1932 cartoon featuring Mickey Mouse but does not relate to the specific video game or the show mentioned in the claim, making it less relevant than the others.

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 3 directly connects to the reasoning steps as it mentions Mickey Mouse was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, which answers the second reasoning step, "Who developed Mickey Mouse?" It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer.
2. Context 19 describes "Mickey's Safari in Letterland," confirming it features Mickey Mouse, addressing the first reasoning step, "What series is Mickey's Safari in Letterland from?" It is directly relevant and informs the claim.
3. Context 18 explains the creation of Mickey Mouse in detail, including Walt Disney's involvement, closely aligning with the second reasoning step and reinforcing the answer to the claim.
4. Context 12 provides general details about Mickey Mouse and related characters but is less specific about the development of Mickey Mouse compared to Context 3 and 18, making it slightly less useful for pinpointing the creators.

# idx: [3, 19, 18, 12]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 3 ("Mickey Mouse") provides the most comprehensive information about Mickey Mouse, stating it was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, which directly answers the reasoning step "Who developed Mickey Mouse? >>>> Walt Disney." This context is highly relevant to the reasoning steps and directly addresses the claim.
2. Context 19 ("Mickey's Safari in Letterland") establishes the connection between the claim and the series by stating Mickey Mouse is the central character in Mickey's Safari in Letterland. This context links the title of the video game to Mickey Mouse, aiding in answering earlier reasoning steps. However, it does not directly answer who developed Mickey Mouse.
3. Context 18 ("Mickey Mouse") offers additional historical details about Mickey Mouse's creation, mentioning key figures like Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. While this context provides relevant background, its lesser emphasis on Walt Disney compared to Context 3 places it third in ranking.

step-by-step think: 
1. Extract entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "What series is Mickey's Safari in Letterland from? >>>> Mickey Mouse" and "who did the original voice for Mickey Mouse >>>> Walt Disney." 
2. Rank contexts according to relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer. High relevance is awarded to contexts that directly address "Mickey Mouse," the series "Mickey's Safari in Letterland," and voice actors, particularly Walt Disney. 
3. Compare the titles and paragraph texts of the contexts for mentions of these entities and relationships.
4. Assign scores based on contextual relevance to the question and prioritize those most likely to answer it.
5. Rank the contexts based on their combined scores and select the top 16.

idx: [10, 6, 8, 14, 3, 12, 4, 1, 5, 0, 16, 13, 18, 11, 7, 9]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will closely follow the outlined criteria: 
1. Matching with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention "Mickey's Safari in Letterland," the series "Mickey Mouse," and the original voice actor "Walt Disney." Contexts discussing Mickey Mouse or its creation and voice actors are highly relevant.
2. Relevance to the claim: The claim asks about the original voice for the character from "Mickey's Safari in Letterland," which ties back to "Mickey Mouse." Contexts directly addressing Mickey Mouse's history or voice actors will score highly. 
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts providing detailed information about Mickey Mouse, his history, and voice actors have a higher chance of containing the answer.

Now, I'll evaluate the given contexts:
1. Context 10 ("Mickey Mouse") provides detailed information about the character, including all the voice actors, and explicitly mentions Walt Disney as the original voice - most likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 8 ("Mickey's Safari in Letterland") mentions the game, directly matching the series' title and establishing the connection to Mickey Mouse.
3. Context 14 ("Mickey Mouse") describes the creation of Mickey Mouse, including Disney’s involvement, which is indirectly relevant and reflects the backstory.
4. Context 3 ("Roger Carel") discusses voice actors for Mickey Mouse, though in French dubbing, which makes it partially relevant.
5. Context 4 ("Mickey Mouse Disco") relates to the Mickey Mouse franchise but doesn't tie directly to the voice actors or creation story.
6. Context 18 ("The Mickey Rooney Show") doesn't directly contribute to answering the claim about Mickey Mouse's voice.
7. Context 0 ("Safari School") mentions "safari," but it has no relevance to the game or Mickey Mouse.
8. Contexts like 12 and 11 discuss unrelated topics with vague keywords like "Mickey" or "safari."

By following this analysis, I rank the contexts based on relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of addressing the claim.

idx: [10, 8, 14, 3, 4, 18, 0, 12]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 8 directly mentions "Mickey's Safari in Letterland" and provides information about it, clearly identifying Mickey Mouse as the central character. This aligns well with the reasoning step "What series is Mickey's Safari in Letterland from? >>> Mickey Mouse" and directly supports the claim.
2. Context with idx 10 focuses on "Mickey Mouse." It mentions that Walt Disney was the original voice of the character, fulfilling the reasoning step "who did the original voice for Mickey Mouse >>> Walt Disney." This context is highly informative and directly related to the claim.
3. Context with idx 14 also provides detailed information about Mickey Mouse's creation by Walt Disney. While it doesn't specifically mention the voice role, it confirms the connection to Walt Disney, making it indirectly relevant to the reasoning steps.
4. Context with idx 3 mentions Mickey Mouse but focuses on Roger Carel as a voice actor for the character in French. While slightly related to the topic of Mickey Mouse voice actors, it is less relevant than the previous contexts as the claim focuses on the original voice, which isn't discussed here.

# idx: [8, 10, 14, 3]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 8 discusses "Mickey's Safari in Letterland" and directly confirms that it stars Mickey Mouse. This aligns with the first reasoning step concerning the connection between the game and the Mickey Mouse series. It is highly relevant and directly related to the claim's subject.  
2. Context with idx 10 provides a detailed timeline of Mickey Mouse's voice actors, including Walt Disney, who originally voiced Mickey Mouse. This directly addresses the second reasoning step and is critical to finding the answer to the claim.  
3. Context with idx 14 describes the origins of Mickey Mouse, including its creation and the inspirations behind the design. While informative about the character, it does not focus on his voice actors or the specific game mentioned in the claim, making it less relevant than the others.  
4. Context with idx 3 mentions Roger Carel, who provided the voice for Mickey Mouse in French, but this is not relevant to the claim, which concerns the original voice for Mickey Mouse in the context of the game.

Question:Who is the child of the creator of A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society?
golden idx: [7, 13]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society >> creator >>>> Edwin Henry Landseer" and "Edwin Henry Landseer >> child >>>> Edwin Landseer Lutyens".
2. Identify contexts with a title or paragraph_text that matches the entities or relationships.
   - Context 7 ("A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society") directly matches the painting and its creator, Edwin Henry Landseer.
   - Context 13 ("Edwin Lutyens") mentions Edwin Landseer Lutyens, who is identified in the reasoning steps as the child of Edwin Henry Landseer.
   - Contexts related to general biographies or studies unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps are deprioritized.
3. Evaluate how well each context matches the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim.
   - Context 7 discusses "A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society" and directly links to Edwin Henry Landseer as its creator.
   - Context 13 discusses Edwin Landseer Lutyens, the child of Edwin Henry Landseer, making it highly relevant.
4. Rank the contexts based on these considerations to maximize relevance to the claim and reasoning steps, prioritizing the direct matches and likely answer sources.

# idx: [7, 13, 6, 5, 10, 11, 0, 8, 9, 1, 14, 15, 2, 4, 16, 19]

# step-by-step think: First, I will evaluate the contexts based on their alignment with the entities and relationships within the reasoning steps: 'A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society >> creator >>>> Edwin Henry Landseer' and 'Edwin Henry Landseer >> child >>>> Edwin Landseer Lutyens'. Contexts explicitly mentioning "Edwin Henry Landseer", "A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society", or "Edwin Landseer Lutyens" are more relevant. Second, I will check their association with the claim of identifying the child of the creator of the painting. Finally, I will prioritize contexts that are most likely to contain the answer based on direct matches with these details.
# 1. Context 7 confirms that Edwin Henry Landseer created "A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society", directly matching the reasoning steps and is highly relevant to the claim.
# 2. Context 13 provides detailed information on Edwin Landseer Lutyens, matching the second reasoning step and directly corroborating the claim's inquiry about the child of Edwin Henry Landseer.
# 3. Other contexts in the collection, such as 6, 5, 10, 11, etc., have no direct relevance to the claim or reasoning steps and won't likely provide the necessary answers.
# idx: [7, 13]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will use the criteria provided:
1. **Match with reasoning steps:** The reasoning steps specify two entities and their relationships: 'A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society >> creator >> Edwin Henry Landseer' and 'Edwin Henry Landseer >> child >> Edwin Landseer Lutyens'. Therefore, match with 'A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society', 'Edwin Henry Landseer', and 'Edwin Landseer Lutyens' is critical.
2. **Relevance to the claim:** The claim is asking who the child of the creator of 'A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society' is. Contexts that discuss Edwin Henry Landseer, his works, or his descendants will rank higher.
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer:** Priority is given to contexts explicitly discussing Edwin Henry Landseer, his work, or Edwin Landseer Lutyens.

Now, I will analyze each context:
- **Context 7**: Discusses 'A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society' as a painting by Edwin Henry Landseer. Highly relevant to the reasoning step and provides context on the creator.
- **Context 13**: Provides information about Edwin Landseer Lutyens, who is the child of Edwin Henry Landseer. Directly relevant to the reasoning steps and the claim.
- **Context 6**: Describes Jenny Slate; irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 5**: Discusses a professor’s academic achievements, unrelated to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 10**: Mentions a founder of the Winnipeg Humane Society, which is not relevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 11**: Talks about Maria Goranova's academic career, irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 0**: Discusses the Lord Lewis Prize, irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 8**: Discusses Linda Greenhouse, unrelated to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 9**: Discusses awards received by Charles A. Kraus, irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 1**: Discusses mathematical prizes, unrelated to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 14**: Discusses Neville A. Stanton's career, irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 15**: Discusses the Declaration of Independence and is irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 2**: Explains anthropology; unrelated to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 4**: Describes a journal of genetics, irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 16**: Describes a horror movie; irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
- **Context 19**: Discusses scientific societies in the Enlightenment; irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.

Based on the above analysis:
- **Context 7** ranks first as it directly establishes the creator of 'A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society'.
- **Context 13** ranks second as it provides information about Edwin Landseer Lutyens, the son of the creator (Edwin Henry Landseer).

The remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim and will not be prioritized in the top 8; for completeness, I'll take the most relevant ones among the unrelated contexts, ranking by their broader potential relevance.

# idx: [7, 13, 6, 5, 10, 0, 8, 9]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 7 discusses "A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society" and identifies Edwin Henry Landseer as its creator, directly matching the first reasoning step ('A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society >> creator >>>> Edwin Henry Landseer'). It is highly relevant to the claim and likely contains part of the necessary information.
2. Context 13 discusses Edwin Landseer Lutyens and provides biographical details, directly addressing the second reasoning step ('Edwin Henry Landseer >> child >>>> Edwin Landseer Lutyens'). It is also very relevant to the claim and likely contains the necessary answer.
3. Context 6 is unrelated to the entities or reasoning steps in the claim, focusing instead on Jenny Slate. As this context does not reference either Edwin Henry Landseer or Edwin Landseer Lutyens, it is irrelevant.
4. Context 5 is irrelevant to the claim, as it discusses Simon Blackburn and provides no connection to the reasoning steps or entities mentioned.

Question:What was the old show that was named after a character that Walt Disney created in 1928 called?
golden idx: [0, 6]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "What character did Walt Disney create in 1928? >>>> Mickey Mouse," "What was the old Mickey Mouse show called? >>>> The Mickey Mouse Club".
2. Calculate the relevance score by checking for contexts that mention "Mickey Mouse" or "The Mickey Mouse Club" in their title or paragraph_text.
3. Prioritize contexts directly discussing Mickey Mouse and The Mickey Mouse Club for informativeness concerning the claim.
4. Evaluate the likelihood that the context contains the answer (e.g., references to Mickey Mouse, his creation in 1928, and old shows like The Mickey Mouse Club).
5. Rank contexts by combining relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores, selecting only the top 16.

# idx: [6, 2, 12, 14, 0, 13, 9, 7, 19, 5, 10, 1, 4, 15, 18, 11]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will consider the following steps: 
1. Evaluate the match between the context content (title and paragraph_text) and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. The reasoning steps focus on two key aspects: Walt Disney creating a character in 1928 (Mickey Mouse) and the name of an old Mickey Mouse show, which is "The Mickey Mouse Club."
2. Assess the contexts' relevance to the claim. Contexts that discuss the creation of Mickey Mouse in 1928 and the show's name will rank higher.
3. Identify the likelihood of the contexts containing the answer. Contexts matching the entities in both reasoning steps and the claim will score the highest.

Now, I will rank the contexts:
1. Context 6 ("The Mickey Mouse Club") directly discusses the old Mickey Mouse show ("The Mickey Mouse Club"), explicitly mentioning its creation by Walt Disney and its history, making it the most relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 2 ("Mickey Mouse") directly describes Mickey Mouse, highlighting that the character was created in 1928 by Walt Disney, which matches the primary reasoning step.
3. Context 12 ("Mickey Mouse") provides detailed information about Mickey Mouse's creation and his first appearance in 1928, aligning with the first reasoning step.
4. Context 14 ("Mickey Mouse") discusses the inspiration and development of Mickey Mouse in 1928, matching the first reasoning step.
5. Context 0 ("Universal Pictures") mentions the creation of Mickey Mouse in 1928 in connection with Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, providing background relevance to the reasoning step.
6. Context 13 ("Mickey's Revue") discusses a Mickey Mouse cartoon, which contributes additional knowledge about Mickey Mouse's media appearances but does not directly address the show's name.
7. Context 9 ("Clarabelle Cow") mentions supporting characters related to Mickey Mouse from the same creative universe, adding peripheral relevance.
8. Context 10 ("Building a Building") references a Mickey Mouse cartoon but does not specifically connect to either reasoning step.

# idx: [6, 2, 12, 14, 0, 13, 9, 10]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 6 ("The Mickey Mouse Club"): This context directly refers to "The Mickey Mouse Club," the old show named after a character Walt Disney created in 1928, which is Mickey Mouse. It provides comprehensive information about the show, including its origin, production, and history. This is highly relevant to both the claim and reasoning steps.
2. Context with idx 2 ("Mickey Mouse"): This context details the creation of Mickey Mouse by Walt Disney in 1928. It matches the reasoning step "What character did Walt Disney create in 1928" and establishes the connection between the character and the claim. 
3. Context with idx 12 ("Mickey Mouse"): This context provides additional details about Mickey Mouse, including its first appearance and creators, aligning well with the reasoning steps. It reinforces the information about the character's creation in 1928.
4. Context with idx 14 ("Mickey Mouse"): This context offers historical details about the development of Mickey Mouse, including Walt Disney's inspiration and naming decision. While it is slightly less directly tied to the specific claim about the show, it provides background information that connects to the reasoning steps.

# idx: [6, 2, 12, 14]

step-by-step think:  
1. Context 6 ("The Mickey Mouse Club"): This context directly mentions "The Mickey Mouse Club," explicitly connecting it to Walt Disney and the character Mickey Mouse. It also provides significant details about the show's history and revivals, aligning closely with the reasoning steps of determining an old show named after Mickey Mouse. It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.  
2. Context 2 ("Mickey Mouse"): This context discusses Mickey Mouse, confirming that the character was created by Walt Disney in 1928. While it provides key background information, it is less focused on addressing the specific show named after Mickey Mouse compared to Context 6.  
3. Context 12 ("Mickey Mouse"): This context also focuses on Mickey Mouse and mentions the creation date, 1928, as well as related details about the character's development. Like Context 2, it is informative but does not directly connect to the specific claim regarding the old show.  
4. Context 14 ("Mickey Mouse"): This context elaborates on the creation of Mickey Mouse and the inspiration behind it. However, it does not provide any direct connection to the show "The Mickey Mouse Club," making it less relevant for the claim.

Question:What military overran much of Erich Zakowski's place of birth?
golden idx: [11, 19]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Erich Zakowski," "place of birth," "East Prussia," and "Russian troops overran much of East Prussia."
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.
3. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on how relevant the context is to the claim.
4. Calculate the likelihood score for each context based on how likely the context may contain the answer to the claim.
5. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to get the final score for each context.
6. Rank the contexts based on the final scores and select the top 16 ranked contexts.

# idx: [11, 19, 0, 9, 17, 18, 5, 13, 14, 3, 7, 15, 10, 6, 4, 2]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate based on the following criteria:
1. Match with entities/relationships in reasoning steps: "Erich Zakowski," "place of birth," "East Prussia," and "Russian troops."
2. Relevance: Focus on descriptions related to Erich Zakowski, East Prussia, and military presence or historical events in East Prussia that relate to being "overrun."
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that provide factual details about East Prussia and its historical events involving Russian military presence will be ranked high.

- Context 11 clearly establishes Erich Zakowski’s place of birth as East Prussia, directly matching the reasoning step about his birthplace. This makes it highly relevant.
- Context 19 discusses East Prussia's history in depth and specifically mentions it being overrun by Imperial Russian troops, aligning with the reasoning about military involvement in East Prussia.
- The rest of the contexts either discuss unrelated events, personalities, or are tangential to the claim, making them less relevant.

By following these steps, I will prioritize contexts most closely related to East Prussia, Erich Zakowski, and the military history involving Russian troops.

# idx: [11, 19, 0, 7, 9, 5, 18, 4]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 11 ("Erich Zakowski"): This context directly mentions Erich Zakowski and provides his place of birth as East Prussia. It directly relates to the reasoning step "Erich Zakowski >> place of birth >>>> East Prussia." This makes it highly relevant and likely to serve as the foundation for answering the claim.
2. Context 19 ("East Prussia"): This context discusses events in East Prussia, including being overrun by Imperial Russian troops during the Seven Years' War. It explicitly connects to the reasoning step "What military overran much of East Prussia? >>>> Russian troops," making it highly relevant and likely to contain part of the answer about the military that overtook East Prussia.
3. Context 0 ("Yang Meng"): This context does not relate to Erich Zakowski, East Prussia, or Russian troops in any way. Thus, it is not relevant to the reasoning steps or claim. It can be safely deprioritized.
4. Context 7 ("Erich Kunz"): This context mentions an unrelated person, Erich Kunz, and does not connect to Erich Zakowski, East Prussia, or Russian troops. It is not relevant to the reasoning steps or claim.
5. Context 9 ("Battle of Abbeville"): While this context discusses a military operation, it pertains to events during World War II and does not focus on Russian troops or East Prussia. This makes it less relevant to the reasoning steps and unlikely to contribute directly to answering the claim.
6. Context 5 ("Hellenistic period"): This context focuses on ancient history and does not mention East Prussia, Russian troops, or Erich Zakowski. It is unrelated to the reasoning steps or claim.
7. Context 18 ("Battle of Puebla"): This describes a battle in Mexico and does not mention East Prussia, Russian troops, or Erich Zakowski. It is unrelated to the reasoning steps or claim.
8. Context 4 ("Dr. Erich Salomon Award"): This pertains to an award and does not mention East Prussia, Russian troops, or Erich Zakowski. It is completely unrelated.

# idx: [11, 19, 9, 5]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 11: This context explicitly mentions Erich Zakowski's place of birth, East Prussia, fulfilling the first reasoning step. It connects Erich Zakowski and East Prussia directly, making it highly relevant to the claim.
2. Context 19: This context discusses East Prussia, including details about its history, and directly mentions that it was overrun by Imperial Russian troops during the Seven Years' War. This corresponds to the second reasoning step and is therefore highly relevant for answering the claim.
3. Context 9: While it discusses military events, it is about the Battle of Abbeville and does not relate to East Prussia or Erich Zakowski. It is not directly relevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.
4. Context 5: This context discusses a military invasion in Anatolia during the Hellenistic period, which is unrelated to East Prussia or the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps.

Question:According to the agency that published U.S. and World Population Clock, what is the total area in square miles?
golden idx: [10, 15]
# step-by-step think:
1. The reasoning steps identify two key entities: "U.S. and World Population Clock" and "United States Census Bureau," with a focus on retrieving the total area in square miles reported by this agency.
2. Contexts directly associated with the "U.S. and World Population Clock" or the "United States Census Bureau" will score higher on relevance, as they are more likely to contain the needed information.
3. Contexts mentioning area in square miles might also be relevant, but their connection to the United States Census Bureau will influence their ranking.
4. The informativeness score is influenced by whether the context provides specific details about the total area or focuses on population statistics related to the United States Census Bureau.
5. Combining the scores for relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer, contexts are ranked and the top 16 are selected.

# idx: [10, 15, 1, 5, 4, 19, 12, 6, 7, 2, 3, 14, 16, 13, 9, 11]

# step-by-step think: 
In order to rank the contexts, I will evaluate them based on the provided rules: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps focus on identifying the agency that published the "U.S. and World Population Clock" (United States Census Bureau) and the total area in square miles according to that agency (17.037 sq. miles).
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts explicitly mentioning the "U.S. and World Population Clock," or the "United States Census Bureau," along with a numerical total area, are prioritized.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Only those contexts mentioning either the relevant agency and/or the total area are likely to contain the answer.

- Context idx 10 directly mentions "U.S. and World Population Clock" and attributes it to the United States Census Bureau, matching the reasoning steps and being highly relevant to the claim.
- Context idx 15 explicitly mentions the total area (17.037 square miles) and attributes it to the United States Census Bureau, which matches the second reasoning step and is directly relevant to the claim.
- Context idx 1 mentions detailed statistics about the United States, including total land area, but does not focus on the Census Bureau directly.
- Other contexts (e.g., idx 6, 7, 14) discuss land areas but are unrelated to the Census Bureau or the Population Clock, making them less relevant to the reasoning steps.

# idx: [10, 15, 1, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context `idx: 10` ("U.S. and World Population Clock") directly relates to the claim as it explicitly mentions the U.S. and World Population Clock, the United States Census Bureau, and their connection, which aligns with the reasoning step about identifying the publisher.
2. Context `idx: 15` ("Atlantic City, New Jersey") explicitly provides data from the United States Census Bureau, including a total area measurement in square miles. This matches the reasoning step about finding the total area and is likely to contain the specific answer.
3. Context `idx: 1` ("United States") offers general information about the United States, including its total area in square miles. While not directly linked to the Population Clock, it still provides relevant information related to area measurements, aligning with the reasoning steps.
4. Context `idx: 13` ("Riverside, California") contains area measurements provided by the United States Census Bureau. However, it is less specifically tied to the U.S. Population Clock and the claim than higher-ranked contexts.

# idx: [10, 15, 1, 13]

# step-by-step think: 

1. Context idx 10 ("U.S. and World Population Clock"): This context directly relates to the first step of the reasoning process as it mentions that the "U.S. and World Population Clock" is presented by the United States Census Bureau, which matches the entity "United States Census Bureau" in the reasoning steps related to the question. However, it does not explicitly mention the total area in square miles, which is asked in the claim. Relevant, but secondary in likely informativeness.

2. Context idx 15 ("Atlantic City, New Jersey"): This context explicitly mentions the "United States Census Bureau" and states a total area value, which aligns with the reasoning step mentioning total area in square miles, but this is specific to a city (Atlantic City, New Jersey) and not the general area referenced in the reasoning steps or claim. It has partial relevance to the question.

3. Context idx 1 ("United States"): This context broadly discusses details about the United States, including its total area of "3.8 million square miles," which could directly answer the second reasoning step about the "total area in square miles" according to the United States Census Bureau. This makes it highly relevant and informative to the claim.

4. Context idx 13 ("Riverside, California"): While this context mentions the "United States Census Bureau" and references a total area in square miles, it is specific to Riverside, California, and does not pertain to the larger context of the total U.S. area being requested in the claim. It is less relevant than others.

2. Identify contexts directly mentioning East Prussia, its northern part, its history, or relevant geographic and administrative changes.  
3. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match with the reasoning steps and the claim.  
4. Assess informativeness based on whether the context provides details about the northern part of East Prussia and its transition to the Russian area or name changes.  
5. Evaluate likelihood by determining which contexts provide factual information most directly addressing the claim.  
6. Combine the scores to rank the contexts and select the top 16 most relevant and potentially informative contexts.

idx: [19, 17, 10, 14, 3, 8, 2, 1, 4, 5, 0, 6, 7, 9, 15, 16]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will evaluate them on the following criteria:
# 1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: I will prioritize contexts discussing "East Prussia" and the replacement of "German names with Russian names" as these directly connect to the reasoning steps.
# 2. Relevance to the claim: Since the claim focuses on historical changes, especially in the "northern part of East Prussia" (now under Russian influence), contexts addressing this region, historical occurrences, or administrative changes will be prioritized.
# 3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that explicitly mention German name replacement with Russian names, population changes, or Soviet policies in the northern part of East Prussia are more likely to contain the answer.

# Analysis of contexts:
1. Context 19: Strongly relevant as it specifically discusses the replacement of German names with Russian names in the northern part of East Prussia and Soviet policies in the region.
2. Context 17: Relevant as it discusses the northern part of East Prussia being annexed by the Soviet Union and becoming part of the Russian SFSR.
3. Context 10: Identifies Erich Zakowski's birthplace as East Prussia, providing a direct link to the reasoning step.
4. Context 14: Discusses geopolitical territorial changes but is less directly relevant to East Prussia or the northern area becoming Russian.
5. Context 7: Describes the movement of a Russian submarine, unrelated to East Prussia or associated historical changes.
6. Context 2, 1, 4, 0, 8, 6, 5, 15, and 16: Unrelated to East Prussia, Russia's northern region, or the claim.

# Ranking based on relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer:
idx: [19, 17, 10, 14, 3, 8, 9, 1]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 19 ("East Prussia") directly addresses events in the northern part of East Prussia after its annexation by the Soviet Union. It explicitly mentions that all German place names were replaced by new Russian names, which aligns closely with the reasoning step and the claim. This context is highly relevant, informative, and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 17 ("Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic") mentions that the northern part of East Prussia was annexed by the Soviet Union, which relates to the geographical and historical setting of the claim. However, it does not directly address what happened to place names in this region, making it slightly less informative than context 19.
3. Context 10 ("Erich Zakowski") identifies East Prussia as Erich Zakowski's birthplace. While it confirms the connection between Zakowski and East Prussia, it does not provide details about events in the northern part of the region or the renaming of places. It is moderately relevant but less informative than contexts 19 and 17.
4. Context 14 ("Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact") discusses territorial changes during and after World War II, mentioning areas annexed by the Soviet Union. However, it does not focus on East Prussia or the renaming of places, making it less directly relevant to the claim.

# idx: [19, 17, 10, 14]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 19 ("East Prussia") is highly relevant as it directly discusses the northern part of East Prussia, which is now a Russian area. It mentions the replacement of German place names with Russian names, aligning with the reasoning step about names being replaced. This context is very likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 17 ("Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic") provides information about the annexation of the northern portion of East Prussia by the Soviet Union. While it is relevant to the geographical and historical context, it does not directly address the replacement of names or other events in the northern part, making it less likely to contain the specific answer compared to Context 19.
3. Context 10 ("Erich Zakowski") mentions Erich Zakowski's birthplace in East Prussia but does not provide additional information about the northern part of East Prussia or events in the now Russian area. It is less relevant to the claim compared to Contexts 19 and 17.
4. Context 14 ("Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact") discusses territories annexed by the Soviet Union but does not focus on East Prussia or the northern part specifically. It is the least relevant to the claim.

golden idx: [3, 18]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Start with identifying the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Erich Zakowski >> place of birth >>>> East Prussia" and "What happened to the Curonians who lived in the area in East Prussia ? >>>> expelled by the Soviet Union". Important entities are "Erich Zakowski", "East Prussia", and "Curonians". Relationship involves identifying the birthplace and the fate of Curonians in East Prussia.
2. Look for contexts where entities such as "Erich Zakowski", "East Prussia", and "Curonians", as well as the historical events relating to expulsions by the Soviet Union, are directly discussed or implied within the title or paragraph_text. 
3. Evaluate context informativeness by determining how much information it provides about the Curonians living in East Prussia and their fate, as well as Erich Zakowski's connection to East Prussia.
4. Assess likelihood based on how closely the context is tied to the claim and its potential to directly address the question posed in the claim.
5. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores for each context to derive a final ranking and select the top 16 contexts.

# idx: [3, 18, 10, 0, 1, 4, 5, 13, 6, 14, 7, 8, 2, 9, 12, 16]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts in relevance to the claim "What happened to the Curonians who lived in the area where Erich Zakowski was born?" and following the reasoning steps, I need to analyze 1) how well the context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps (e.g., "Curonians," "Erich Zakowski," "East Prussia," and "expelled by the Soviet Union"), 2) the relevance of each context to the claim, and 3) the likelihood of containing the answer.

1. Context 3 directly mentions the Curonians in East Prussia and discusses what happened to them, including being "expelled by the Soviet Union," which matches the reasoning steps and claim most precisely.
2. Context 18 gives details about Erich Zakowski, including his place of birth (East Prussia), which is important for linking him to the area where the Curonians lived.
3. Context 10 discusses East Prussia and mentions significant historical events during the time period related to Nazi policy, which could form the broader context for understanding what happened in East Prussia.
4. Context 8, while not directly discussing the specific Curonians or East Prussia, mentions an "Erich Salomon," which might tangentially relate to shared historical names/heritage relevant to East Prussia.
5. Other contexts such as 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc., do not mention Curonians, East Prussia, or those specific historical/sociopolitical developments, making them irrelevant.

Thus, based on relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer:
idx: [3, 18, 10, 13, 2, 0, 9, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 3 ("East Prussia"): This context directly discusses what happened to the Curonians in the area around the Curonian Lagoon in East Prussia. It matches the reasoning step on the fate of the Curonians (e.g., fleeing from the Red Army, being expelled by the Soviet Union, and anti-German discrimination). It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 
2. Context 18 ("Erich Zakowski"): This context confirms Erich Zakowski's place of birth as East Prussia, directly linking to the reasoning step of identifying the location. While it doesn't address the Curonians' fate directly, it connects the claim to the geographic location, making it relevant.
3. Context 10 ("East Prussia"): This context describes events in East Prussia during and after the Nazi period, including toponymic changes and forced relocations. It is somewhat relevant to the historical context of East Prussia but does not specifically address the Curonians or their fate, making it less likely to contain the specific answer. 
4. Context 13 ("Casa Natal del General Santander"): This context is about the birthplace of General Santander, unrelated to either Erich Zakowski or the Curonians in East Prussia. It is not relevant to the claim and unlikely to contain the answer.

# idx: [3, 18, 10, 13]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 3: This context directly addresses the fate of the Curonians in East Prussia, mentioning their expulsion by the Soviet Union, which aligns with the reasoning step "What happened to the Curonians who lived in the area in East Prussia? >>>> expelled by the Soviet Union." It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 18: This context provides information about Erich Zakowski's birthplace, East Prussia, which is part of the reasoning step "Erich Zakowski >> place of birth >>>> East Prussia." While it does not directly address the fate of the Curonians, it is relevant to establishing the geographical connection.
3. Context 10: This context discusses historical events in East Prussia, such as the renaming of places and Nazi policies. While it is related to the region, it does not directly address the Curonians or their fate, making it less relevant than the other two contexts.

1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: 'Julius Caesar,' 'producer,' 'John Houseman,' 'Where did John Houseman study or work?' and 'Clifton College.' The main focus is on John Houseman's education and work history.
2. Evaluate context titles and paragraph texts to find matches with entities and relationships from the reasoning steps.
3. Prioritize contexts that mention John Houseman directly, especially those discussing his educational or work background, as these are most likely to contain the answer.
4. Assess the remaining contexts for peripheral relevance to John Houseman or Julius Caesar as a film he produced, to ensure the ranking captures the top 16 relevant contexts.
5. Rank contexts based on relevance (match to reasoning steps), informativeness (how well they address the claim), and likelihood of containing the answer.

idx: [18, 19, 1, 0, 3, 5, 7, 17, 15, 4, 6, 11, 8, 10, 9, 16]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts according to the rules, I will:
# 1. Look for contexts explicitly related to the reasoning steps. The reasoning steps mention "Julius Caesar >> producer >>>> John Houseman" and "Where did John Houseman study or work? >>> Clifton College".
#    - Contexts mentioning "Julius Caesar" or "John Houseman" are more relevant.
#    - Contexts that reference "Clifton College" or John Houseman's career or education should be prioritized.
# 2. Evaluate each context based on its relevance to the claim and its likelihood of containing the answer.
# 3. Rank accordingly, selecting the most relevant and informative contexts.

# Analysis:
# - Context 19 mentions "Julius Caesar" and identifies the producer as John Houseman, making it highly relevant.
# - Context 18 discusses John Houseman's background, including his education at Clifton College and work in London, directly addressing the reasoning steps and the claim.
# - Other contexts (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 8, etc.) discuss unrelated events or figures, making them mostly irrelevant for this claim.

# Final ranking:
idx: [18, 19, 0, 1, 3, 5, 15, 7]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 18: This context directly relates to the reasoning steps by providing information about John Houseman, including his education at Clifton College and details about his work history. It is highly relevant to the claim and likely contains the specific answer regarding where John Houseman studied or worked. 
2. Context 19: This context mentions that Julius Caesar (the film) was produced by John Houseman, directly linking to the reasoning about the producer of Julius Caesar. Although it doesn't mention his education or work locations specifically, it provides critical contextual information about his role as a producer.
3. Context 0: This context discusses the assassination of Julius Caesar, which is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps about the producer of the Julius Caesar film. Therefore, it is less relevant.
4. Context 1: This context discusses events in Roman history related to Julius Caesar and Pompey, which are unrelated to the reasoning steps or the claim. Thus, it is not relevant.
5. Context 3: While discussing Roman historical events, this context is also unrelated to the claim about the Julius Caesar film producer or where John Houseman studied or worked.
6. Context 5: Focused on the Ides of March and the assassination of Julius Caesar, it does not connect to the reasoning steps or claim. It is irrelevant.
7. Context 15: This context discusses Julius Caesar's military activities, irrelevant to the reasoning steps or the claim about the film producer.
8. Context 7: This context details a series of paintings about Julius Caesar's triumphs, which is unrelated to the claim about the film producer.

# idx: [18, 19, 0, 1]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 19 ("Julius Caesar (1953 film)") is highly relevant as it explicitly mentions that John Houseman was the producer of the 1953 film Julius Caesar. It directly connects the individual mentioned in the reasoning steps to the claim and is highly likely to contain significant and relevant information.
2. Context idx 18 ("John Houseman") aligns closely with the second reasoning step asking about where John Houseman studied or worked. This context details his education at Clifton College and his work in London and the United States, which directly addresses the claim.
3. Context idx 0 ("Assassination of Julius Caesar") discusses historical events related to Julius Caesar and does not mention John Houseman or his work as a producer. It is not directly relevant to the claim or the reasoning steps, making it less likely to contain the answer compared to the other contexts.

golden idx: [0, 10]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Los Angeles County," "United States Census Bureau," and "total area in square miles (17.037 square miles)."  
2. Compare the titles and paragraph_text of each context with the entities and relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps.  
3. Evaluate relevance of the context based on how well it matches the claim's requirements about the total area of Los Angeles County as considered by the United States Census Bureau.  
4. Assess the informativeness and likelihood of each context containing the answer about Los Angeles County's area as defined by the United States Census Bureau.  
5. Rank the contexts by combining relevance, informativeness, and likelihood.  
6. Select the top 16 highest-scoring contexts.

idx: [0, 6, 10, 19, 13, 9, 1, 7, 8, 5, 18, 3, 16, 14, 15, 11]

# step-by-step think:
1. I first identify key entities and relationships from the reasoning steps: "Los Angeles County," "separate metropolitan area," "United States Census Bureau," and "total area in square miles (17.037 square miles)."
2. Contexts most directly matching the entities ("United States Census Bureau" and "Los Angeles County" with "area in square miles") and providing relevant information directly addressing the claim are ranked higher. Additionally, contexts explicitly linking Los Angeles County with its area consideration will receive more weight.
3. Contexts discussing population, other unrelated counties or entities, or general state-wide information will rank lower, as they are less relevant.
4. Finally, consideration is given to how likely each identified context is to contain the specific information about whether Los Angeles County is designated as a separate metropolitan area and its square mileage.

### Ranking process:
- **Context 0**: Mentions the "United States Census Bureau" alongside "total area of 17.037 square miles," which matches the reasoning steps directly. This is highly relevant and likely contains the answer.
- **Context 10**: Discusses how the "United States Census Bureau" considers separate metropolitan areas and includes Los Angeles County, making it directly relevant to the claim and reasoning steps.
- **Context 16**: Talks about Los Angeles County's status as part of California's demography, which includes jurisdiction over population and area and indirectly supports the claim.
- **Context 1**: Contains information about metropolitan areas in Southern California, including Los Angeles County, deemed relevant though lacks direct specifics on the total square area or United States Census Bureau designation.
- **Context 9**: Mentions square miles regarding another city, Riverside, and comparisons to Los Angeles County, which may provide marginally related support.
- **Context 19**: Lists information about metropolitan areas where Los Angeles is discussed but lacks a direct mention of the Census Bureau judgment or detailed area.
- **Context 7**: Provides broader information about the Greater Los Angeles Area, partially relevant but not specific to the claim.
- **Context 13**: Discusses California generally, including Los Angeles County, but fails to add specific value to addressing the claim.

# idx: [0, 10, 16, 1, 9, 19, 7, 13]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 0: This context directly references the United States Census Bureau and provides a specific total area in square miles for a city (17.037 square miles). It precisely matches the reasoning step, which asks about the total area in square miles mentioned by the United States Census Bureau. This context is highly relevant.
2. Context 10: This context discusses how the United States Census Bureau considers certain counties and metropolitan areas, directly linking it to the concept of the Census Bureau classifying areas. However, it does not provide specific square mileage data for Los Angeles County. It is relevant but less specific to the claim.
3. Context 9: This context provides total area details of Riverside, California, as reported by the United States Census Bureau. However, it does not mention Los Angeles County or metropolitan area specifics and is less relevant compared to Context 0.
4. Context 16: While this context mentions demographics and large metropolitan areas including Los Angeles County, it does not provide specifics regarding the Census Bureau classification or the total square miles, so it is less likely to contain the exact answer compared to the others.

# idx: [0, 10, 9, 16]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context idx 10: This context mentions that the "United States Census Bureau considers the San Bernardino and Riverside County areas... as a separate metropolitan area from Los Angeles County," directly addressing the entity from the reasoning steps. However, it doesn't mention the total area in square miles, limiting its relevance to the claim.
2. Context idx 0: This context explicitly states, "According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 17.037 square miles." The entity ("United States Census Bureau") and the total area in square miles ("17.037 square miles") are both directly mentioned, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
3. Context idx 9: This context also contains relevant information from the "United States Census Bureau," providing the total area of another city (Riverside, California). While interesting, it doesn't pertain directly to Los Angeles County or the claim about its status as a separate metropolitan area.
4. Context idx 16: This context discusses demographics and population growth in California, mentioning Los Angeles County as one of the state's largest counties. However, it doesn't address the reasoning steps' focus on the "United States Census Bureau" or the total area in square miles, making it less pertinent.

idx: [2, 15, 5, 12, 11, 17, 1, 14, 4, 3, 7, 6, 8, 18, 9, 0]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will use the following criteria: 1) Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: I will check how well the context matches the entities "census county division," "United States Census Bureau," and mentions of "total area in square miles." Matches directly reflecting these entities or concepts will score higher. 2) Relevance to the claim: I'll evaluate if the context provides information about the total area in square miles, specifically attributed to the United States Census Bureau, as this directly answers the question. 3) Likelihood of containing the answer: A context explicitly mentioning area measurements or detailed Census Bureau role descriptions will be prioritized as more likely to contain the answer.

1. Context 15 (Census county division): This directly describes "Census County Division" and its connection to the "United States Census Bureau," aligning closely with the reasoning step "census county division >> creator >>>> United States Census Bureau."
2. Context 2 (Atlantic City, New Jersey): This provides detailed information about total area in square miles directly from the "United States Census Bureau," making it highly relevant.
3. Context 5 (Ann Arbor, Michigan): This also offers total area data from the "United States Census Bureau" and includes specific geographical measurements.
4. Context 12 (Charleston, South Carolina): This similarly provides area measurements attributed to the Census Bureau, which is relevant to the claim.
5. Context 11 (Columbia, South Carolina): This context offers another set of area measurements linked to the Census Bureau, adding further corroboration.
6. Context 17 (Riverside, California): It includes details about area measurements from the "United States Census Bureau."
7. Context 4 (Kansas City, Missouri): Provides area details useful for comparing geographical scope, though less directly tied to Census County Division than previous contexts.
8. Context 1 (San Diego): Offers Census-based area data but is less specific about its primary connection to the reasoning steps than other contexts.

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 15 ("Census county division"): This context references "Census County Division" and directly explains its relation to the United States Census Bureau, which is the organization mentioned in the reasoning steps. This context provides critical background, establishing the link between the claim and the entity creating CCDs. It is highly relevant and informative.

2. Context with idx 2 ("Atlantic City, New Jersey"): This context mentions the United States Census Bureau and provides specific details about a total area in square miles (17.037 square miles). This value aligns directly with the reasoning step that mentions the total area according to the Census Bureau. It is central to the question.

3. Context with idx 5 ("Ann Arbor, Michigan"): Similar to the previous context, this one also mentions the United States Census Bureau calculating the total area. Though it discusses a different city, it reflects the involvement of the Census Bureau and provides details related to total area measurements. It is relevant but not as specific as context idx 2.

4. Context with idx 12 ("Charleston, South Carolina"): This context also mentions the United States Census Bureau and provides details about total area measurements (127.5 square miles). While informative, it is less likely to directly address the specific claim compared to the other contexts mentioned above.

# idx: [15, 2, 5, 12]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 15 ("Census county division"): This context introduces what a Census County Division (CCD) is and directly mentions the United States Census Bureau as its creator, aligning well with the reasoning step "census county division >> creator >>>> United States Census Bureau." However, it does not discuss the total area in square miles, making it moderately related but not likely to contain the answer directly.
2. Context 2 ("Atlantic City, New Jersey"): This context explicitly states, "According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 17.037 square miles," matching the reasoning step "According to United States Census Bureau, what is the total area in square miles? >>>> 17.037 square miles." It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context 5 ("Ann Arbor, Michigan"): While this context provides the total area of Ann Arbor as reported by the United States Census Bureau, it does not connect to the specific reasoning steps or entities directly related to Census County Divisions, making it less relevant to the claim.
4. Context 12 ("Charleston, South Carolina"): This context provides the total area of Charleston as per the United States Census Bureau. However, similar to context 5, it does not align with the reasoning steps about Census County Divisions or the specific figure of 17.037 square miles, making it less relevant to the claim.

5. Rank contexts by calculated scores, selecting the top 16 most relevant and informative entries.  

idx: [3, 9, 4, 11, 15, 19, 7, 12, 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 14, 16, 18]

step-by-step think: I will rank the contexts based on the following criteria: 1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps indicate connections like "Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing developed by United States Census Bureau" and the total area of Atlantic City. 2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts relevant to the United States Census Bureau, Atlantic City, or total area in square miles are prioritized. 3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that explicitly mention the United States Census Bureau and total area information will rank higher. Contexts that simply mention areas unrelated to Atlantic City or geographic encoding are deprioritized.

1. Context 3 explicitly mentions "Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing" and its connection to the United States Census Bureau. This is crucial for establishing the developer relationship.
2. Context 9 specifies Atlantic City's total area as 17.037 square miles, which directly answers the claim. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer.
3. Context 4 mentions the United States Census Bureau's area calculations for Pollock but is less relevant since it's not about Atlantic City.
4. Context 11, 15, 19, 7, and others give area data for cities unrelated to Atlantic City and the claim, making them less relevant.

Accordingly, contexts directly mentioning the claim-related keywords and reasoning steps (like 3 and 9) rank higher, followed by marginally related contexts like 4.

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts according to the given rules, I will evaluate each one based on: 1. How well the title or paragraph text matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. The reasoning steps reference "The Acting Company," "John Houseman," and "Clifton College." Thus, contexts mentioning any of these terms would score higher. 2. Relevance to the specific question: since the claim asks where "the founder of The Acting Company" studied, any context directly mentioning John Houseman's education, especially Clifton College, would be prioritized. 3. Likelihood that the context contains the answer. Contexts that directly mention John Houseman's background, education, or Clifton College are more likely to contain the answer.
# idx: [12, 19, 11, 14, 3, 17, 0, 4]

# step-by-step think: 1. The context titled "John Houseman" (idx: 12) directly mentions John Houseman, his place of education (Clifton College), and his connection with The Acting Company. This context strongly aligns with the reasoning steps and is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 2. The context titled "Edgar Lansbury (producer)" (idx: 19) mentions John Houseman and The Acting Company but does not provide details about where John Houseman studied. It is less informative than idx: 12 but still relevant. 3. The remaining contexts, such as "Carmelo Gómez" (idx: 11), "Marilyn Monroe" (idx: 14), and others, either discuss unrelated individuals or topics, such as Marilyn Monroe's acting career, Carmelo Gómez's awards, or historical information about organizations. These do not directly relate to John Houseman's education or The Acting Company. Therefore, they are ranked lower for relevance and informativeness relating to the reasoning steps.
# idx: [12,19,11,0]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context with "John Houseman" (idx: 12): This context directly mentions John Houseman, the founder of The Acting Company, and provides detailed information about where he was educated, specifically Clifton College. It aligns perfectly with the reasoning steps and directly answers the claim.
2. Context titled "Edgar Lansbury (producer)" (idx: 19): While this context mentions John Houseman in the context of an award related to The Acting Company, it does not provide information regarding where John Houseman studied. It is somewhat relevant but contains less specific information related to the claim.
3. Context titled "Carmelo Gómez" (idx: 11): This context discusses an unrelated actor and does not connect to the reasoning steps or the claim. It is not relevant to the inquiry.
4. Context titled "Louis Delâge" (idx: 0): Although informative, this context discusses an engineer's educational and professional background, which is unrelated to John Houseman or The Acting Company. Thus, it is not relevant to the claim.

Question:When did the crowning of the person under whom the Chapter House was built happen?
golden idx: [1, 12]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Under whom was the chapter house built? >>>> Henry III" and "When was Henry III crowned? >>>> 1216". The key entities are "chapter house," "Henry III," and "1216."
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps:
   - Contexts that mention "Henry III," "chapter house," and/or "1216" are highly relevant.
3. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on how relevant the context is to the claim (e.g., contexts addressing the construction of the chapter house, Henry III's reign, or his coronation event are highly informative).
4. Calculate the likelihood score for each context based on how likely the context may contain the exact information needed to address the claim.
5. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to get the final score for each context.
6. Rank the contexts based on the final scores and select the top 16 ranked contexts.

# idx: [1, 12, 0, 3, 6, 13, 5, 7, 8, 4, 9, 10, 2, 16, 11, 14]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the following aspects: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: In the reasoning steps, the key entities are "Henry III" and "crowned in 1216." Therefore, contexts referencing Henry III, his coronation, or related timelines are prioritized. 
2. Relevance to the claim: The claim is about identifying the date when Henry III was crowned, so contexts that discuss his coronation or timelines related to his reign will be ranked higher. 
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that explicitly describe Henry III's coronation details or a closely related event are most likely to contain the answer.

Based on the reasoning process:
- Context 1 ("Westminster Abbey") explicitly mentions Henry III's coronation in 1216, which directly aligns with the reasoning steps. 
- Context 12 ("Westminster Abbey") mentions that the Chapter House was built under Henry III, providing indirect relevance. 
- Context 2 ("Carlinville Chapter House") is unrelated to the claim about Henry III. 
- Contexts like 3, 4, 6, 7, and others are about unrelated topics such as buildings, estates, or organizations, and do not connect to Henry III or the reasoning steps.

I will rank the contexts accordingly.
# idx: [1, 12, 0, 3, 6, 13, 5, 7]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 1 directly mentions Henry III being crowned in 1216, which matches reasoning step two about when Henry III was crowned. It provides relevant details about his coronation and is highly likely to contain the answer for the claim.  
2. Context 12 discusses the chapter house being built under Henry III, which ties to reasoning step one about under whom it was built. Its relevance to the claim is significant as it connects Henry III with the construction.  
3. Context 0 provides general information about Westminster Abbey, but it doesn't directly address the building of the chapter house or Henry III's coronation. Its relevance is limited compared to contexts 1 and 12.  
4. The rest of the contexts, such as Context 3, 6, 13, 5, and 7, discuss unrelated topics such as estates, houses, and halls, which are neither relevant to Henry III nor the chapter house. These are not likely to contain an answer to the claim.  

# idx: [1, 12, 0, 3]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 1: This context explicitly mentions Henry III and his coronation in 1216, directly addressing the second reasoning step which states "When was Henry III crowned?". It is highly relevant to the claim and likely contains part of the answer.
2. Context with idx 12: It confirms Henry III as the individual under whom the chapter house was built and specifies the time frame of its construction. This directly aligns with the first reasoning step regarding "Under whom was the chapter house built?" and contributes to understanding the timeline. This context is also highly relevant to the claim.
3. Context with idx 0: Although it is about Westminster Abbey, it focuses on governance details unrelated to Henry III or the chapter house construction. It is less relevant to the specific claim compared to idx 1 and idx 12.
4. Context with idx 3: This context discusses the Nicolas Carriger Estate, which is entirely unrelated to the claim about Henry III and the chapter house. It is not relevant.

Question:Who is the spouse of the person who sang holding out for a hero in shrek 2?
golden idx: [10, 17]
step-by-step think: 1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "who sang holding out for a hero in shrek 2 >>>> Jennifer Saunders", "Jennifer Saunders >> spouse >>>> Adrian Edmondson". 2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. High relevance would include explicit mentions of Jennifer Saunders, Holding Out for a Hero, Adrian Edmondson, or Shrek 2 soundtrack details. 3. Assess informativeness by evaluating how well the context provides information that directly addresses the reasoning steps or claim. 4. Consider likelihood (e.g., contexts relating directly to Jennifer Saunders, Shrek 2, or the relationship between Saunders and Edmondson are more likely to contain the needed answer). 5. Combine these scores and rank based on their cumulative scores, selecting the top 16 ranked contexts.

idx: [17, 10, 19, 15, 12, 5, 1, 0, 18, 14, 7, 9, 4, 2, 3, 8]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will evaluate their relevance based on: 
1. How the context's title or paragraph matches entities or relationships found in the reasoning steps. The reasoning steps explicitly mention "Jennifer Saunders" who sang "Holding Out for a Hero" in Shrek 2 and her "spouse", Adrian Edmondson.
2. The relevance of each context to the claim, i.e., identifying the spouse of Jennifer Saunders.
3. The likelihood of a given context containing pertinent information to the claim.

- Context 17 explicitly mentions Jennifer Saunders singing "Holding Out for a Hero" in Shrek 2. This strongly aligns with the first reasoning step and establishes foundational context directly involving her.
- Context 10 mentions both Jennifer Saunders and Adrian Edmondson (her spouse), clearly connecting the reasoning steps and providing the likely source for the spouse-related detail.
- Contexts 19, 15, 5, 1, 0, and 12 provide background or related details about Shrek or its creators but do not delve into Jennifer Saunders or her personal life. They are less likely to address the claim directly.

Therefore, the highest priority is given to contexts with explicit mentions of relevant entities and relationships central to addressing the claim.

# idx: [17, 10, 19, 15, 5, 1, 0, 12]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 17: This context mentions that Jennifer Saunders recorded the song "Holding Out for a Hero" specifically for the 2004 film Shrek 2. It directly aligns with the first step of reasoning ("who sang holding out for a hero in shrek 2 >>>> Jennifer Saunders") and is highly relevant to the claim. This is the most likely context to identify the singer, confirming her involvement with the song in Shrek 2.
2. Context idx 10: This context mentions Jennifer Saunders and Adrian Edmondson together, referencing their contributions to a UK sitcom. While it does not explicitly discuss their marital relationship, the mention of both individuals together offers a strong indication that this context may help bridge the reasoning step about Jennifer Saunders' spouse ("Jennifer Saunders >> spouse >>>> Adrian Edmondson").
3. Context idx 19: While this context focuses on the broader Shrek franchise and its representation at the Cannes Film Festival, it mentions Shrek 2 as part of the series. This is a peripheral connection to the claim, as it does not directly address the singer or her spouse. Its relevance is moderate but not as direct or informative as the top two contexts.
4. Context idx 15: This context provides a general description of the Shrek franchise and includes Shrek 2 in its discussion. While it belongs to the correct domain, it lacks specific details about the singer of "Holding Out for a Hero" in Shrek 2 or her spouse, making it less directly relevant.

# idx: [17, 10, 19, 15]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context with idx 17: This context directly mentions that Jennifer Saunders recorded "Holding Out for a Hero" for Shrek 2, confirming the singer. It is highly relevant to the first reasoning step ("who sang holding out for a hero in shrek 2 >>>> Jennifer Saunders") and is likely to contain essential information for the claim. 
2. Context with idx 10: This context mentions Jennifer Saunders and Adrian Edmondson in connection with a sitcom pilot. It aligns with the second reasoning step ("Jennifer Saunders >> spouse >>>> Adrian Edmondson"), providing information on both Jennifer Saunders and her spouse. This makes it relevant and likely to help address the claim.
3. Context with idx 19: While this context gives general information about the Shrek franchise, it does not specifically address the singer of "Holding Out for a Hero" nor Jennifer Saunders' relationship. It is less directly relevant compared to the top two entries.
4. Context with idx 15: Similar to idx 19, this context provides general information about the Shrek franchise but is not focused on Jennifer Saunders, the song, or her spouse. It is the least relevant to the claim among the provided contexts.

Question:Who is the spouse of the creator of Absolutely Fabulous?
golden idx: [2, 8]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: The claim pertains to identifying the spouse of the creator of "Absolutely Fabulous." 
   - Entities highlighted are "Absolutely Fabulous," Jennifer Saunders (creator), and Adrian Edmondson (her spouse).
2. Match contexts based on relevance and informativeness:
   - Direct matches with "Absolutely Fabulous" or Jennifer Saunders are prioritized.
   - References to Adrian Edmondson (relationship to Saunders) also are highly relevant.
3. Assess likelihood of containing the answer:
   - Contexts explicitly mentioning the creation of "Absolutely Fabulous," Jennifer Saunders, or Adrian Edmondson are most likely to contain the answer.
   - Contexts without any clear references to these entities are deprioritized.
4. Rank the remaining contexts based on these factors.

# idx: [8, 2, 12, 18, 13, 19, 3, 1, 4, 6, 15, 16, 10, 5, 11, 9]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will evaluate based on the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention "Absolutely Fabulous," "Jennifer Saunders," and "Adrian Edmondson." Contexts mentioning these entities or relationships will score highly. 
2. Relevance to the claim: The claim is about the spouse of the creator of "Absolutely Fabulous," so contexts mentioning Jennifer Saunders and especially Adrian Edmondson as her spouse will be important. 
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts directly mentioning the marital relationship between Jennifer Saunders and Adrian Edmondson or with relevant corroboration are prioritized.

Analyzing the contexts:
- **Context 8** discusses "Absolutely Fabulous" and states that it was created by Jennifer Saunders. This matches the reasoning step "Absolutely Fabulous by >>> Jennifer Saunders."
- **Context 2** mentions Adrian Edmondson in relation to Jennifer Saunders through their collaboration on "Mirrorball," suggesting relevance to their relationship and indirectly supporting the step "Jennifer Saunders >> spouse >>> Adrian Edmondson."
- **Context 12** (about Mok Kwai-lan) and other random titles such as "Absolute World" or "Absolute zero" have no links to the entities or the reasoning steps.
- After filtering, I will prioritize contexts directly mentioning these key figures or their relation.  

# idx: [8, 2]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will consider the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: I will identify contexts that mention or are closely related to "Absolutely Fabulous," "Jennifer Saunders," or "Adrian Edmondson."
2. Relevance to the claim: The contexts that most directly reference "Absolutely Fabulous" or its creator Jennifer Saunders, and further mention her spouse or Adrian Edmondson, will score higher.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that are most likely to provide information about Jennifer Saunders and her spouse, based on the content, will be ranked higher.

Now, I will evaluate the contexts:
- Context 8 directly mentions "Absolutely Fabulous" and that it was created and written by Jennifer Saunders. This is relevant to the first reasoning step.
- Context 2 is relevant because it mentions both Adrian Edmondson and Jennifer Saunders, potentially providing information linking the two, aligned with the reasoning steps.
- Context 12 mentions "spouse" but is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps as it refers to a different person unrelated to Jennifer Saunders or Adrian Edmondson.
- Other contexts (e.g., 18, 13, 19, etc.) are unrelated to the claim, "Absolutely Fabulous," or the reasoning steps. They are irrelevant and receive lower priority for ranking.

Final ranking prioritizes how well each context matches Jennifer Saunders, Adrian Edmondson, and their roles or relationships.

# Final ranking and reasoning for inclusion:
idx: [8, 2, 12, 5, 19, 1, 11, 9]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 8 ("Absolutely Fabulous") mentions Jennifer Saunders as the creator of "Absolutely Fabulous," directly matching the claim and the reasoning step "Who is Absolutely Fabulous by? >>>> Jennifer Saunders." It is highly relevant and likely contains key information about Jennifer Saunders. 
2. Context 2 ("Mirrorball (TV pilot)") mentions Jennifer Saunders and Adrian Edmondson together, matching the reasoning step "Jennifer Saunders >> spouse >>>> Adrian Edmondson." The inclusion of both entities makes it highly relevant to finding the spouse of Jennifer Saunders. 
3. Context 12 ("Mok Kwai-lan") does not directly relate to Jennifer Saunders, Adrian Edmondson, or "Absolutely Fabulous." It seems entirely unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps.
4. Context 5 ("Absolute World") is completely unrelated to the claim and reasoning steps, as it discusses a residential complex rather than any people or shows.

step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps. The key entities and relationships are: the "fairy godmother in Shrek 2", "Jennifer Saunders", and her "spouse", "Adrian Edmondson".
2. Evaluate the relevance of the contexts to the claim by looking for information specifically about: 
   - Jennifer Saunders' role as the Fairy Godmother in Shrek 2.
   - Jennifer Saunders' spouse (Adrian Edmondson), or their relationship.
3. Select contexts mentioning Jennifer Saunders or the Fairy Godmother from Shrek 2, giving priority to detailed connections about her spouse and her role in Shrek 2. 
4. Check for contextual connection to the claim, such as broader or supporting information about Shrek 2 or Jennifer Saunders' career.
5. Rank based on the likelihood of containing the relevant answer.

idx: [6, 11, 8, 5, 16, 3, 13, 18, 2, 12, 15, 19, 7, 0, 9, 4]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will:
1. Identify matches with reasoning steps:
   - Reasoning Steps mention "Jennifer Saunders" as the actress who played the Fairy Godmother in "Shrek 2" and "Adrian Edmondson" as her spouse.
   - Contexts related to "Shrek 2," "Jennifer Saunders," her career, and Adrian Edmondson will score higher.
2. Assess relevance to the claim:
   - The contexts mentioning "Fairy Godmother," "Shrek 2," or Jennifer Saunders' personal life will likely be more relevant.
3. Evaluate likelihood of containing the answer:
   - Contexts closely tied to Saunders' biography, career, or spouse will be highly informative.

Now I will evaluate each context:
- **Context 6**: Discusses "Shrek 2" and lists Jennifer Saunders as the voice of the Fairy Godmother. Highly relevant to the reasoning steps as it confirms the actress. Score: High.
- **Context 8**: References Adrian Edmondson and Jennifer Saunders and their collaboration in "Mirrorball." Strong indication of Saunders' spouse. Score: High.
- **Context 11**: Declares Saunders' involvement in the "Shrek 2" soundtrack but doesn't address the claim or spouse. Score: Medium.
- **Context 5**: Explains the "Shrek" franchise but is less focused on Saunders or her role in "Shrek 2." Score: Medium-Low.
- **Context 13**: Discusses "Princess Fiona" in "Shrek" series. Irrelevant to Saunders or her spouse. Score: Low.
- **Context 3**: Covers "Shrek the Third." Though tied to the franchise, it does not connect to Saunders' role or her spouse directly. Score: Low.
- **Context 9**: Covers "Shrek the Halls," a special between films, unrelated to Saunders or her spouse. Score: Low.
- **Context 19**: Mentions another actress, unrelated to Saunders or the claim. Score: Low.
- **Context 18**: General "Shrek" film details, including release history but not focused on Saunders. Score: Low.
- **Context 15**: Discusses the origins of "Shrek" as a book, unrelated to the claim. Score: Low.
- **Context 0**: Concerns the play "The Skriker," unrelated to the reasoning steps. Score: Low.
- **Context 4**: Discusses an unrelated silent film about fairies. Score: Low.
- **Context 12**: Discusses "Kung Fu Panda," unrelated to Shrek or Saunders. Score: Low.
- **Context 2**: Mentions characters related to fairies but unrelated to "Shrek" or Saunders. Score: Low.
- **Context 16**: Discusses Shrek characters but not the Fairy Godmother or Saunders. Score: Low.
- **Context 7**: Covers a Shakespearean character, irrelevant to the claim. Score: Low.

# idx: [6, 8, 11, 5, 18, 13, 3, 9]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 6: This paragraph is from "Shrek 2" and specifically mentions Jennifer Saunders as the voice of the Fairy Godmother. This directionally aligns with the first reasoning step and is highly relevant to finding the answer to the claim. 
2. Context idx 8: This context indirectly connects Jennifer Saunders and Adrian Edmondson by mentioning that the pilot Mirrorball was directed by Adrian Edmondson and written by Jennifer Saunders. This connection is necessary for determining Jennifer Saunders' spouse in accordance with the second reasoning step. 
3. Context idx 11: Although "Holding Out for a Hero" relates to Jennifer Saunders as she recorded it for the Shrek 2 movie, it does not address the reasoning step about the spouse. It provides only tangential relevance. 
4. Context idx 5: This context discusses the Shrek franchise broadly but doesn’t capture key details about either Jennifer Saunders or her relationship to Adrian Edmondson, so it is less relevant compared to other options.

# idx: [6, 8, 11, 5]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 6 ("Shrek 2") provides detailed information about the movie Shrek 2 and explicitly mentions Jennifer Saunders as the voice actor for the Fairy Godmother. This aligns with the reasoning step "who plays the fairy godmother in shrek 2 >>>> Jennifer Saunders," making it highly relevant and likely to contain the necessary background information required for this claim.  
2. Context 8 ("Mirrorball (TV pilot)") mentions both Adrian Edmondson and Jennifer Saunders—the key individuals in the second reasoning step, "Jennifer Saunders >> spouse >>>> Adrian Edmondson." This direct mention of both entities makes the context highly relevant to the claim about Jennifer Saunders' spouse.  
3. Context 11 ("Holding Out for a Hero") references Jennifer Saunders and her involvement in Shrek 2. While relevant, it does not explicitly contribute new information directly concerning the spouse of Jennifer Saunders compared to context 8.

Question:When was John's eldest son crowned?
golden idx: [2, 17]
# step-by-step think:
1. Break down the reasoning steps: "Who was John's eldest son? >>>> Henry III" and "When was Henry III crowned? >>>> 1216". Relevant entities include "John", "eldest son", "Henry III", and "crowned in 1216".
2. Identify relevant contexts based on matches to these entities or relationships. Contexts directly mentioning "John", his "eldest son", "Henry III", or "coronation in 1216" are prioritized.
3. Prioritize contexts matching multiple reasoning steps or directly addressing the claim (e.g., Henry III's coronation date).
4. Combine relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to determine rankings.
5. Select the top 16 ranked contexts.

# idx: [2, 17, 3, 12, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 5, 11, 18, 10]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, the following criteria will be considered: 1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: a focus will be on contexts mentioning John's eldest son (Henry III) and his coronation year (1216). 2. Relevance to the claim: priority will be given to contexts providing direct evidence about Henry III's coronation or his reign. 3. Likelihood of containing the answer: contexts explicitly mentioning Henry III's coronation details or surroundings will be highly ranked. Contexts that are unrelated, such as those discussing unrelated individuals, will be deprioritized.

idx: [17, 2, 12, 4, 6, 7, 3, 1]

# step-by-step think:
1. **Context 17 ("Westminster Abbey")**: This context directly mentions Henry III and specifically discusses his coronation in 1216, as well as the reasons behind it. It precisely aligns with the reasoning steps and contains the likely answer to the claim. It is the most relevant context.
2. **Context 2 ("John, King of England")**: This context confirms Henry III as John's eldest son, an important reasoning step toward answering the claim. While it does not mention the coronation date, it is still very relevant as it supports the reasoning process.
3. **Context 12 ("Wondosson Kassa")**: This context mentions an "eldest son" being associated with a coronation, but it does not mention John, Henry III, or relevant events. Its relevance is low, as its entities and stories diverge from the claim.
4. **Context 6 ("Succession to the British throne")**: This context discusses heirs and succession but has no mention of John, Henry III, or their coronation. It is peripheral and largely unrelated to the claim.
5. **Context 4 ("Liu Ju")**: This context involves a crown prince but pertains to the Western Han Dynasty, unrelated to John or Henry III. Its relevance to the claim is minimal.
6. **Context 7 ("Eric Penn")**: This only mentions an eldest son in a historical context unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps.
7. **Context 1 ("Sir William Maule")**: This also discusses an eldest son but does not relate to the claim or reasoning steps. It provides no relevant links.
8. **Context 3 ("HMS Farnham Castle")**: Irrelevant context, as it discusses a ship with no relation to the claim.

# idx: [17, 2, 6, 4]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 17 (Westminster Abbey): This context explicitly mentions the coronation of Henry III in 1216, which is directly relevant to the reasoning steps and the claim. It discusses the circumstances of his coronations in detail, including the initial coronation in Gloucester Cathedral. This is highly likely to contain the answer.
2. Context idx 2 (John, King of England): This context confirms that John's eldest son was Henry III and mentions that he ruled for the majority of the 13th century. Although it corroborates part of the reasoning steps, it doesn't specifically address the coronation date, making it less directly informative compared to idx 17.
3. Context idx 6 (Succession to the British throne): This context discusses the British monarchy but does not mention John, Henry III, or any coronation details, making it less relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 4 (Liu Ju): This context is unrelated, as it focuses on a Western Han Dynasty prince and has no connection to John, Henry III, or the coronation.

Question:When was the sibling of Alice de Lusignan, Countess of Surrey crowned?
golden idx: [5, 13]
step-by-step think:
1. Extract entities and relationships from the reasoning steps: Alice de Lusignan, Countess of Surrey; sibling; Henry III; Henry III crowned in 1216.
2. Evaluate each context for the presence of these entities and relationships—especially ones that focus on "Alice de Lusignan" or "Henry III's coronation in 1216."
3. Prioritize contexts that explicitly discuss Henry III or his coronation, as this directly answers the question of when her sibling (Henry III) was crowned.
4. Rank contexts higher if they discuss Alice de Lusignan's family connections, which affirm the sibling relationship with Henry III.
5. Consider broader contexts related to Westminster Abbey and Henry III's coronation setting or historical specifics as they strengthen understanding.
6. Rank based on relevance, likelihood of containing pertinent information to the claim, and informativeness.

idx: [13, 5, 6, 3, 2, 7, 14, 4, 12, 9, 1, 8, 0, 11, 10, 15]

# step-by-step think: 
In order to rank the contexts, I will consider the relevance of the provided contexts to the question and reasoning steps. First, Alice de Lusignan, Countess of Surrey and her sibling Henry III are central entities in the question. Contexts that explicitly mention her or King Henry III directly or involve the coronation of Henry III (1216) are highly relevant. Further, details surrounding Henry III's coronation in 1216 are closely aligned with the reasoning steps, making those contexts particularly significant. I will prioritize these contexts over others that either do not mention or are only tangentially related to the entities or events mentioned in the reasoning steps.

# idx: [13, 5, 2, 12, 14, 0, 3, 8]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 13 ("Westminster Abbey"): This context explicitly mentions Henry III's coronation in 1216 and later in 1220. It directly relates to the reasoning step "When was Henry III crowned? >>>> 1216" and provides specific information. It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 5 ("Alice de Lusignan, Countess of Surrey"): This context discusses Alice de Lusignan and her relationship to Henry III, identifying her as his half-sister. It is relevant because it establishes the familial connection in the reasoning step but does not mention Henry III's coronation date.
3. Context 12 ("Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville"): Joan de Lusignan is mentioned here, but this context is less directly related to Alice de Lusignan or Henry III's coronation. The relevance is weaker, as it does not address the main aspects of the reasoning steps or the claim.
4. Context 2 ("John, King of England"): This context discusses the Lusignan family but focuses on relationships and conflicts involving John of England rather than Alice or Henry III. It is less relevant to the claim and reasoning steps.

# idx: [13, 5, 12, 2]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 13 discusses the coronation of Henry III in 1216, which directly aligns with the reasoning step "When was Henry III crowned? >>> 1216". This context is highly relevant and likely to answer the claim as it talks about Henry III's coronation details. 
2. Context 5 provides a brief mention of Alice de Lusignan being a half-sister of Henry III, which aligns with the reasoning step "Alice de Lusignan, Countess of Surrey >> sibling >>>> Henry III". However, it does not detail Henry III's coronation, making it less relevant than Context 13.
3. Context 12 and Context 2 are unrelated to the specific entities or relationships in the reasoning steps and do not provide information about Henry III's coronation or his sibling, Alice de Lusignan. They are much less relevant than the others.

Question:What year was the father of Katherine of England crowned?
golden idx: [0, 7]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Katherine of England," "father" >> "Henry III," and "Henry III crowned in 1216."
2. Examine contexts for the mention of "Katherine of England," "Henry III," "crowning," or anything matching these reasoning points.
3. Contexts directly providing information related to Henry III’s coronation or Katherine’s familial relationship with Henry III are most relevant.
4. Calculate relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores. Strong matches with the reasoning steps will score higher.
5. Rank the contexts and select the top 16 based on these combined scores.

# idx: [7, 13, 0, 8, 4, 1, 5, 9, 18, 3, 6, 2, 11, 14, 15, 17]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the following key points: 
1. **Match with entities or relationships in reasoning steps**: Reasoning steps mention Katherine of England (daughter), her father Henry III, and the year 1216 when Henry III was crowned. Contexts related to Katherine, Henry III, or coronation details in 1216 are most important. 
2. **Relevance to the claim**: The claim asks specifically about Katherine of England's father, Henry III, and his coronation year. Contexts providing direct evidence about Henry III's coronation will be ranked higher.
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts with explicit mentions of Henry III, Katherine of England, or details of coronation timings are most likely to contain the answer.

Step by step:
- Context 7 discusses Henry III's first coronation in 1216, which directly aligns with the reasoning steps and claim.
- Context 13 corroborates his coronation year as 1216 and adds details of a second coronation in 1220, making it directly relevant as well.
- Context 0 provides background on Katherine of England, confirming her as Henry III's daughter but lacks coronation details.
- Context 8 discusses an unrelated figure (Liu Yin) and has no relevance or match to entities.
- Context 4 discusses Galdan Tseren, which has no relationship to the claim or entities.
- Context 1, 5, 9, 3, 6, 2, 11, 14, 15, and 17 are completely unrelated to Henry III, Katherine, or the coronation.

Based on this reasoning:
idx: [7, 13, 0]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts in addressing the claim "What year was the father of Katherine of England crowned?", I will:
1. Identify contexts mentioning "Katherine of England," her father "Henry III," and his coronation year "1216." These match terms from the reasoning steps.
2. Prioritize contexts discussing "Henry III," his reign, coronation, and any events tied to Katherine, which are directly relevant to answering the claim.
3. Consider the likelihood that each context might contain the answer or lead directly to it based on its content.

- Context 7 discusses Henry III's coronation in 1216 and is highly relevant.
- Context 13 mentions Henry III's coronation and is also highly relevant.
- Context 0 confirms Katherine's parentage, directly linking her to Henry III.
- Contexts unrelated to Katherine, Henry III, or his coronation (e.g., 8, 4, unrelated Katherines, or other historical figures) are less relevant.

# idx: [7, 13, 0, 14, 17, 11, 3, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 7: This context mentions Henry III's coronation in 1216, which matches the reasoning step "When was Henry III crowned? >>>> 1216." It provides detailed information about the event and aligns closely with the claim about the father of Katherine of England. This context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer.
2. Context 13: This context specifically mentions the coronation of Henry III in 1216 and provides additional details about a second coronation in 1220. It aligns well with the reasoning steps and elaborates on the crowning events, making it very relevant and informative.
3. Context 0: This context states that Katherine of England was the child of Henry III and Eleanor of Provence, directly confirming the relationship mentioned in the reasoning step "Katherine of England >> father >>>> Henry III." However, it does not provide direct information about Henry III's coronation, making it slightly less relevant than the other two contexts.

Question:What month did the person who retained trust in Longchamp go away to the Holy Land?
golden idx: [4, 18]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Who's trust did Longchamp retain? >>>> Richard" and "What month did Richard go away from the Holy Land? >>>> October." Key entities are Longchamp, Richard, Holy Land, and October. Key relationships include trust retained by Longchamp and Richard's departure to the Holy Land in October.
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.
3. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on how relevant the context is to the claim, particularly focusing on Richard, Longchamp, and the timeline of events related to the Holy Land.
4. Calculate the likelihood score for each context based on how likely the context may contain the answer to the claim, particularly focusing on Richard's departure in October and Longchamp's role.
5. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to get the final score for each context.
6. Rank the contexts based on the final scores and select the top 16 ranked contexts.

idx: [4, 6, 7, 18, 9, 13, 11, 14, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 19]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will use the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps ("Who's trust did Longchamp retain? >>>> Richard" and "What month did Richard go away from the Holy Land? >>>> October"). 
   - For the first step, contexts mentioning Longchamp's relationship with Richard or his trust in Longchamp are relevant. 
   - For the second step, contexts mentioning Richard's departure to or from the Holy Land or timelines (e.g., the mention of "October") are relevant.
2. Relevance to the claim: The context should provide meaningful information about Richard, Longchamp, and events surrounding their trust and Richard's departure to/from the Holy Land.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer to the claim: Contexts that directly address the timeline or circumstances of Richard going to the Holy Land will rank higher.

Now, analyzing the contexts step-by-step:
- Context 4: This context mentions Richard's departure from the Holy Land on "9 October 1192," which matches well with the reasoning step about the month Richard left the Holy Land. Highly relevant.
- Context 18: Mentions that Longchamp retained Richard's trust and also describes events after the Crusade. Relevant to the first reasoning step about Longchamp retaining Richard's trust.
- Context 6: Discusses political tensions involving Longchamp and Richard's brother John but doesn't directly address Richard's timeline or trust in Longchamp. Somewhat relevant.
- Context 7: Mentions Richard joining the Third Crusade and background on the preparations but doesn't discuss specific timelines or the month. Moderately relevant.
- Context 9: Provides a detailed background on Longchamp and his career but doesn't link him specifically to timelines or events of Richard's departure, thus less relevant to the claim.
- Context 13: Talks about the Prix de l'Abbaye de Longchamp, which coincidentally mentions "October," but is entirely unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. Not relevant.
- Context 14: Discusses somebody writing about traveling to the Holy Land, but it does not relate to Richard, Longchamp, or the context of the claim. Not relevant.
- Context 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 19: These contexts do not discuss Richard, Longchamp, or any relevant timelines; they are not related to the claim or the reasoning steps.

Based on the above analysis:
idx: [4, 18, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 8]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 4 ("Third Crusade"): This context specifically mentions Richard departing the Holy Land on 9 October 1192. It directly connects to the reasoning step about the month Richard left the Holy Land. The detailed and clear timeline makes it highly relevant and likely to answer the claim.
2. Context idx 18 ("William de Longchamp"): This context confirms that Richard retained trust in Longchamp and provides details about Longchamp's role during Richard's absence for the crusade. It is relevant for connecting Richard’s trust in Longchamp to his departure for the Holy Land.
3. Context idx 7 ("John, King of England"): This context establishes Richard's plans to join the Third Crusade and the measures he took before leaving, helping set up the background for understanding when Richard left. While it is indirectly relevant to identifying the month Richard left, it adds context to his departure.
4. Context idx 6 ("John, King of England"): This context mentions events involving Longchamp and Richard’s delegation of power to him. It provides tangential details about Richard's absence and Longchamp's role, which may add background but is less directly connected to pinpointing the month.

# idx: [4, 18, 7, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 4 provides the exact departure date of Richard from the Holy Land, which directly addresses the second part of the reasoning steps and claim. It explicitly mentions that Richard departed on "9 October 1192," making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context idx 18 discusses Longchamp's relationship with Richard, establishing the trust factor necessary for answering the first reasoning step. It confirms that Longchamp retained Richard's trust and mentions some relevant events linked to Richard's activities during the Third Crusade. However, it does not specifically address the departure date.
3. Context idx 7 provides some background on Richard's involvement in the Third Crusade and discusses administrative arrangements during his absence. While it provides context for Richard's actions and involvement with Longchamp, it doesn't specify Richard's departure month for the Holy Land, making it less directly relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 6 discusses John taking control in London and the political situation with Longchamp but does not address Richard's trust in Longchamp or his departure date. It is the least relevant to the claim and reasoning steps.

Question:When did a storm disperse the fleet led by the English king who trusted William de Longchamp?
golden idx: [3, 11]
# step-by-step think:
1. Interpret the reasoning steps, which suggest the context must involve the storm that dispersed Richard the Lion-hearted's fleet in 1191 and any relevant details about William de Longchamp and his relationship with Richard.
2. Assess the contexts for mentions of Richard, the storm in 1191, and events leading to or during the Third Crusade, as well as William de Longchamp's role under Richard.
3. Priority is given to contexts explicitly mentioning the storm dispersing Richard's fleet in 1191 and William de Longchamp, then general mentions of Richard and his journey during the Third Crusade.
4. Contexts involving similar storms, fleets, or crusade-related topics that don't explicitly align with the claim are placed lower in the ranking.
5. Combine scores for relevance to the reasoning steps, informativeness, and likelihood of providing an answer to the claim to rank the contexts and select the top 16.

# idx: [3, 8, 11, 14, 15, 4, 0, 18, 6, 17, 1, 13, 16, 12, 19, 9]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will assess the following factors:  
1. Match with reasoning steps: The context should align with the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps such as "Richard", "storm dispersed the fleet", "William de Longchamp", and "1191".  
2. Relevance to the claim: Preference is given to contexts discussing the storm affecting Richard's fleet in 1191 while establishing connections to William de Longchamp's trust.  
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts describing Richard's fleet, the storm, or the mentioned timeline and circumstances have a higher probability of providing the answer.  

Based on these considerations:  
- Context 3 directly mentions Richard, the Lion-hearted, his fleet being dispersed by a storm, and events taking place in 1191. It provides key evidence related to the reasoning steps and claim.  
- Context 11 discusses Richard trusting William de Longchamp and provides general background on their relationship, which is relevant for understanding the claim.  
- Context 8 outlines Richard's leadership during his time as king and part of the timeframe when he participated in the Third Crusade, so it offers partial relevance.  
- Context 14 highlights political dynamics involving Richard, John, and Longchamp, making it somewhat relevant but secondary to the specific event of the storm.  
- Contexts 18 ("Action of 26 July 1566"), 0 ("Ana Free"), and 16 ("Delta Air Lines fleet") are irrelevant to the reasoning steps and claim and thus rank lower.  

Prioritizing relevance and likelihood, my top-8 are ranked as follows:  

# idx: [3, 11, 8, 14, 1, 13, 12, 9]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 3 addresses Richard the Lion-hearted, his fleet, and the storm in 1191, directly matching the reasoning steps ("What year did the storm hit Richard's fleet?" and "Who's trust did Longchamp retain? Richard"). It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 11 discusses William de Longchamp retaining Richard's trust and mentions events during Richard's reign. It matches the reasoning steps well and provides background on Longchamp's relationship with Richard, making it relevant and potentially informative.
3. Context 8 mentions Richard's preparation for the Third Crusade, his political arrangements in England, and William Longchamp's appointment as chancellor. This ties into the reasoning step about Longchamp and Richard, adding context but without direct mention of the storm.
4. Context 14 discusses political conflict related to John and Longchamp but also mentions Richard's activities (e.g., marriage in Cyprus) around the Third Crusade. While it is less directly relevant to the storm, its mention of Richard connects it to the reasoning steps. 

# idx: [3, 11, 8, 14]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 3 ("Normans"): This context directly mentions Richard the Lion-hearted, his fleet, and the storm that dispersed it in 1191. It provides detailed information about the event, including the timeline and aftermath, making it highly relevant to the claim and likely to contain the answer. 
2. Context 11 ("William de Longchamp"): This context discusses William de Longchamp's relationship with Richard and confirms that Longchamp retained Richard's trust. While it does not directly address the storm or the fleet, it is relevant to the reasoning step about Longchamp retaining Richard's trust.
3. Context 8 ("John, King of England"): This context provides background on Richard's preparations for the Third Crusade and mentions William Longchamp's role as chancellor. However, it does not directly address the storm or the fleet, making it less relevant than the first two contexts.

Question:In the King's Speech, who played the person who was the King of England in 1950?
golden idx: [1, 7]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "King of England in 1950 >>> George VI" and "played King George VI in the King's Speech >>> Colin Firth".  
   Key entities: King of England, 1950, George VI, the King's Speech, played, Colin Firth.  
2. Prioritize contexts containing direct references to George VI, the King's Speech, or Colin Firth.  
3. Assess the relevance of each context's title or paragraph_text to these entities or relationships.  
4. Determine the likelihood that the context contains the specific answer to the claim (i.e., Colin Firth playing George VI in the King's Speech).  
5. Rank the contexts based on their relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer, and select the top 16.

# idx: [1, 7, 6, 15, 0, 5, 11, 8, 3, 4, 9, 10, 14, 13, 19, 12]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will consider the following criteria: 1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps - The reasoning steps indicate "King of England in 1950" (George VI) and "played by Colin Firth in The King's Speech." Contexts directly referencing George VI or The King's Speech are highly relevant. 2. Relevance to the claim - Contexts must provide information about who played the king in the film The King's Speech. 3. Likelihood of containing the answer - Contexts describing the movie's details or directly discussing George VI's portrayal are prioritized. Contexts unrelated to these topics will not rank high.
# idx: [1, 7, 6, 15, 0, 11, 8, 10]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 1 ("The King's Speech") is highly relevant as it directly mentions the film "The King's Speech" and states that Colin Firth played King George VI. This context aligns perfectly with the reasoning steps and is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 7 ("George VI") is also highly relevant as it provides information about George VI, who was the King of England in 1950. This context supports the reasoning steps and is important for establishing the identity of the king during that time.
3. Context 6 ("Lascelles Principles") mentions King George VI in the context of the 1950 general election. While it is less directly related to the claim than Contexts 1 and 7, it still provides relevant information about the king during that period.
4. Context 15 ("List of English monarchs") provides historical information about English monarchs, but it is less specific to the claim compared to the other contexts. It is still somewhat relevant as it could help confirm the identity of the king in 1950.

# idx: [1, 7, 6, 15]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with `idx: 1` titled "The King's Speech" directly mentions the film "The King's Speech" and confirms that Colin Firth played King George VI, who was also the King of England in 1950. This context is both highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context with `idx: 7` titled "George VI" provides direct information about George VI, the King of England in 1950. While it does not explicitly connect to the film, it is still essential to the reasoning steps about who was the King in 1950.
3. Context with `idx: 6` titled "Lascelles Principles" mentions King George VI in the setting of the 1950s but focuses on political principles rather than context relevant to the film or actor Colin Firth. While it provides a timeline link to King George VI, it is less likely than the prior two contexts to answer the claim directly.

Question:What is the record label for the singer who originally sang You Belong To Me.
golden idx: [11, 13]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "who sang the original you belong to me >>>> Joni James" and "Joni James >> record label >>>> MGM Records."
2. Look for contexts that mention "You Belong to Me," "Joni James," or "MGM Records" in their title or paragraph_text.
3. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's content and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.
4. Assess the informativeness of each context in relation to the claim about the record label for the singer who originally sang "You Belong to Me."
5. Evaluate the likelihood of each context containing the answer to the claim.
6. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to rank the contexts and select the top 16.

# idx: [11, 13, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17]

# step-by-step think: 
In order to rank the contexts, I will evaluate the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps:
- The reasoning steps mention Joni James, the original singer of "You Belong to Me," and her association with the record label MGM Records. Therefore, contexts referring to Joni James, "You Belong to Me," or MGM Records are directly relevant.
2. Relevance to the claim:
- The claim asks for the record label for the original singer of "You Belong to Me." Therefore, contexts discussing this song, the involved artists, or the record label will score higher.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer:
- A context providing details about Joni James' recording history or mentions the specific association with MGM Records will be prioritized over less detailed references.

Based on this analysis:
1. Context 11 directly mentions that Joni James recorded "You Belong to Me" and later saw it reissued on MGM Records, perfectly matching the reasoning steps.
2. Context 13 confirms her album was released by MGM Records, also supporting the reasoning steps.
3. Context 1, while unrelated directly to Joni James, confirms a general discussion on labels for artists (though less relevant).
4. Context 0 does not match the steps; contexts on Chris LeDoux’s records ranked below.

# idx: [11, 13, 12]

# step-by-step think: 
To effectively rank the contexts, I will carry out the following:
1. **Match with Reasoning Steps:** I will first assess how well the context's title or paragraph_text aligns with the reasoning steps provided. Specifically, we are looking for connections to "Joni James," "MGM Records," and the song "You Belong To Me." Direct mentions of these elements will guarantee a high rank.
2. **Relevance to the Claim:** Contexts that discuss the original singer of "You Belong To Me" and their association with a record label will be prioritized.
3. **Likelihood of Containing the Answer:** Contexts that specifically discuss Joni James, her original recording of "You Belong To Me," or her association with MGM Records are the most likely to contain the record label information and will receive higher scores.

Scoring each context:
- **Context 11:** Very relevant. This context explicitly states that Joni James recorded "You Belong To Me" and mentions MGM Records. It matches both reasoning steps.
- **Context 13:** Relevant. Provides information on Joni James's album released by MGM Records, reinforcing the relationship between Joni James and the label but doesn't discuss "You Belong To Me."
- **Context 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17:** Irrelevant. These contexts do not mention Joni James, "You Belong To Me," or MGM Records, so they are less relevant to the claim.

Ranked list based on relevance:
1. Context 11 (idx 11)
2. Context 13 (idx 13)

Other contexts, while unrelated, will be included in the ranking as filler in descending order of general relevance.

# idx: [11, 13, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 11: This context mentions the song "You Belong to Me" and specifies that the first recording was by Joni James. Additionally, it mentions that the record label was initially Sharp Records and then reissued on MGM Records after Joni James signed to MGM. This directly aligns with the reasoning steps, identifying Joni James and MGM Records as part of the claim. It is highly informative and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context 13: This context provides information about Joni James' debut album, "Let There Be Love," and explicitly mentions that it was released by MGM Records. While it does not directly reference "You Belong to Me," it confirms the relationship between Joni James and MGM Records, which is relevant to the second reasoning step.
3. Context 0: This context does not mention Joni James, "You Belong to Me," or any relevant details tied to the reasoning steps. It discusses a completely unrelated album by a different artist, making it irrelevant to the claim.
4. Context 1: This context describes the debut album of a rock band named Collective Soul, which is unrelated to Joni James, "You Belong to Me," or MGM Records.

# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the reasoning steps: 
   - "who sang the song you belong to me >>>> Joni James"
   - "Joni James >> record label >>>> MGM Records"
   
2. Focus on contexts mentioning "You Belong to Me," "Joni James," and "MGM Records" as they are most relevant to the claim.

3. Assess the titles and paragraph texts for mentions of the reasoning steps' entities and relationships.

4. Measure relevance to the claim:
   - Strongly relevant contexts explicitly mention "Joni James," "You Belong to Me," or "MGM Records."
   - Moderately relevant contexts might indirectly reference related entities.

5. Combine relevance, informativeness (detail provided about the song or artist), and likelihood of containing the answer to rank contexts.

6. Select the top 16 contexts based on the combined score.

# idx: [10, 16, 13, 6, 5, 0, 7, 1, 3, 4, 2, 12, 11, 15, 9, 18]

step-by-step think:  
1. The reasoning steps suggest the song "You Belong to Me" is associated with Joni James and Joni James' record label is MGM Records. The contexts should therefore emphasize these entities: the song, Joni James, and MGM Records.  
2. I will prioritize contexts that discuss Joni James, "You Belong to Me," or MGM Records as they directly relate to the reasoning steps.  
3. Contexts discussing "You Belong to Me" and confirming MGM Records as Joni James' label are most likely to contain the answer. Other contexts associated with Joni James or her albums on MGM Records are also relevant.  

Following these criteria:  
- Context 10 explicitly discusses Joni James, her recording of "You Belong to Me," and mentions MGM Records for national distribution. This context is highly relevant.  
- Context 16 discusses Joni James’ debut album released by MGM Records. It strongly connects Joni James to the label.  
- Context 13 does not relate to Joni James, "You Belong to Me", or MGM Records.  
- Contexts 6, 5, 0, 7, 1, and others discuss unrelated topics or artists, and don’t help resolve the claim.  

Final ranking will focus on contexts linked to Joni James and MGM Records.  

idx: [10, 16]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will apply the following steps:
1. Check how well the titles or paragraph_texts of the contexts match the reasoning steps, specifically focusing on mentions of "Joni James," "You Belong to Me," and "MGM Records," which are central entities in the reasoning steps.
2. Evaluate the relevance of each context to the claim about the record label associated with the artist and song. 
3. Assess the likelihood of the context containing the answer, particularly those mentioning Joni James or "You Belong to Me" with specifics about the record label.

- Context idx 10 mentions Joni James, "You Belong to Me," and explicitly links it to national distribution by MGM Records. This strongly aligns with the reasoning steps.
- Context idx 16 discusses Joni James and her relationship with MGM Records, making it highly relevant but less specific about "You Belong to Me."
- Context idx 6 is irrelevant as it discusses an unrelated song and artist.
- Context idx 5 references a song with a similar title but is not about Joni James or "You Belong to Me."
- Context idx 0 and others like 7, 12, etc., are unrelated to Joni James, "You Belong to Me," or MGM Records.
- Context idx 13 discusses "Up Where We Belong," irrelevant to the reasoning steps.
- Context idx 15 features Billy Joel, not Joni James or the entities in the claim.

Considering these criteria, the most relevant contexts are those clearly discussing Joni James, "You Belong to Me," and MGM Records, in that order of priority.

# idx: [10, 16, 5, 6, 13, 0, 7, 15]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context with "idx: 10" ("You Belong to Me (1952 song)") directly discusses Joni James and mentions that her version of the song "You Belong to Me" was released on M-G-M Records, which aligns perfectly with the reasoning steps. This makes it the most relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. The context with "idx: 16" ("Let There Be Love (1953 Joni James album)") discusses Joni James and her association with MGM Records in the context of her debut album. While it doesn't mention "You Belong to Me," it reinforces the connection between Joni James and MGM Records. Thus, it is relevant but slightly less specific to the claim.
3. The context with "idx: 5" ("I Belong to Me") discusses a song by Jessica Simpson and is not related to Joni James or the song "You Belong to Me." As such, it is significantly less relevant compared to the others.
4. The context with "idx: 6" ("Rub It In") is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps and mentions a different song and artist. It is not relevant to the question.

Question:When is the next episode of the series that Steven the Sword Fighter is a part of being released?
golden idx: [10, 18]
# step-by-step think:
1. **Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps**:
   - Step 1: "Steven the Sword Fighter >> part of the series >>>> Steven Universe"
   - Step 2: "when is the next Steven Universe episode being released >>>> TBD"
   - Key entities: "Steven the Sword Fighter", "Steven Universe", "next episode".

2. **Calculate relevance of each context**:
   - Contexts mentioning "Steven Universe", episodes list, or closely related titles or descriptions have high relevance.
   - Direct mentions of "Steven the Sword Fighter" or "episodes related to Steven Universe" are the strongest matches.

3. **Calculate informativeness**:
   - Contexts listing episodes of "Steven Universe" or discussing release dates provide higher informativeness.
   - Contexts unrelated to "Steven Universe" or release schedules for unrelated series score low.

4. **Assess likelihood of containing the answer**:
   - Contexts explicitly addressing "Steven Universe" and release schedules have a high likelihood.

5. **Rank contexts based on final combined score (relevance, informativeness, likelihood)**:
   - Contexts directly mentioning or involving "Steven the Sword Fighter" or "Steven Universe" rank higher.
   - Less relevant or unrelated contexts rank lower.

# idx: [10, 18, 6, 3, 1, 13, 2, 15, 5, 7, 9, 0, 4, 17, 11, 8]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will apply the following criteria: 

1. **Match with reasoning steps entities/relationships**: The reasoning steps are focused on "Steven the Sword Fighter," its association with "Steven Universe," and identifying information on the next episode of "Steven Universe." Contexts directly covering "Steven the Sword Fighter," "Steven Universe," or the list/schedule of Steven Universe episodes are prioritized. 

2. **Relevance to the claim**: The contexts should provide details about the next episode of "Steven Universe," its release date, or surrounding information. 

3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts such as episode information or lists specific to "Steven Universe" are more likely to contain relevant information about the next episode. 

Based on the above:
- Context 10 explicitly mentions "Steven the Sword Fighter" being part of Steven Universe, directly linking it to the reasoning steps. 
- Context 18 lists Steven Universe episodes, potentially addressing the "next episode release."
- Context 7 mentions a television series "Big Giant Swords," which shares thematic overlap (swords) but diverges in context relevance. 
- Context 6, 2, 1, etc., diverge from the reasoning steps by being specific to unrelated television series or concepts.

I will prioritize the most closely aligned and directly relevant contexts.

# idx: [10, 18, 7, 9, 1, 0, 4, 5]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context "Steven the Sword Fighter" (idx: 10) discusses the specific episode "Steven the Sword Fighter" and its place within the series "Steven Universe." This matches directly with the reasoning step that identifies "Steven the Sword Fighter" as part of "Steven Universe." It's highly relevant and informative.
2. The context "List of Steven Universe episodes" (idx: 18) explicitly lists information about the episodes, including their release status, which directly relates to identifying when the next episode is being released. This is central to answering the claim and is highly relevant.
3. The context "Big Giant Swords" (idx: 7) is entirely unrelated as it focuses on another television series about sword-making and is not connected to "Steven Universe" or the claim.
4. The context "Australia's Next Top Model (season 8)" (idx: 9) discusses the release schedule of a different television series. It is unrelated to the entities or claim.
5. The contexts "Full Bars" (idx: 1), "The Dauphin" (idx: 0), "The Sopranos (season 6)" (idx: 4), and "Silicon Avatar" (idx: 5) all pertain to other television shows and are unrelated to the entities or events in the claim.

Based on the reasoning steps and the claim, the most directly relevant and likely contexts are those concerning "Steven Universe" and its episodes. 
# idx: [18, 10, 7, 9]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context with idx 18, titled "List of Steven Universe episodes," is highly relevant as it directly refers to "Steven Universe" episodes and includes information about an episode with a "TBD" release date. This matches the reasoning step about finding the next episode's release date for the series "Steven Universe," which "Steven the Sword Fighter" is a part of. It is very likely to contain the answer.
2. The context with idx 10, titled "Steven the Sword Fighter," is directly relevant to the claim as it explicitly mentions "Steven the Sword Fighter" as an episode of the series "Steven Universe." While it provides background, it is less likely to have details on the next episode's release date compared to idx 18.
3. The context with idx 7, titled "Big Giant Swords," is unrelated to either "Steven Universe" or its episodes and does not match the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. It is not relevant to the claim.
4. The context with idx 9, titled "Australia's Next Top Model (season 8)," discusses a completely different topic unrelated to "Steven Universe" or its episodes and is not relevant to the claim.

Question:Who played the monarch at the end of WW2 in The King's Speech?
golden idx: [0, 7]
step-by-step think:  
1. Analyze the reasoning steps: The steps connect the "monarch at the end of World War 2" to "George VI" and then identify "Colin Firth" as the actor who played George VI in "The King's Speech."  
2. Contexts directly addressing King George VI, World War 2 events, and Colin Firth's role in "The King's Speech" are highly relevant.  
3. Contexts like "The King's Speech" (title) or those directly mentioning George VI provide strong relevance to the claim and reasoning steps.  
4. Contexts mentioning specific information about other monarchs, rulers, or irrelevant historical events have low relevance.  
5. Rank contexts based on their alignment with the reasoning steps and how likely they are to contain the answer to the claim.  

idx: [7, 0, 12, 9, 1, 8, 17, 15, 10, 14, 16, 18, 11, 3, 19, 2]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts for the given claim, I evaluated based on the following considerations:
1. Match with entities/relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps focus on the monarch at the end of WWII, identified as George VI, and the actor Colin Firth, who portrayed him in "The King's Speech." Contexts that explicitly mention George VI or Colin Firth in connection with "The King's Speech" are prioritized.
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts that supply information about George VI, his reign, or "The King's Speech" are highly relevant.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts more likely to mention who played George VI in "The King's Speech" are ranked higher.

- Context idx 7 clearly discusses "The King's Speech," mentioning Colin Firth as the actor who plays George VI, directly addressing the claim.
- Context idx 0 provides background information on George VI, confirming he was the monarch at the end of WWII, complementing the reasoning steps.
- Context idx 12 describes key historical events involving George VI, but not directly tied to "The King's Speech."
- Context idx 9, although referring to royalty, is primarily about Oriel College's historical connections.
- Contexts like idx 1, 8, 17, etc., are less specific to the reasoning steps or claim, focusing on other monarchs or general royal history.

idx: [7, 0, 12, 9, 8, 11, 16, 19]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 7 ("The King's Speech") is highly relevant as it directly mentions Colin Firth playing King George VI in the film "The King's Speech." This context aligns perfectly with the reasoning steps and is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 0 ("George VI") provides background information about King George VI, who was the monarch at the end of World War II. While it does not directly address the film or the actor, it is relevant to the reasoning steps and the claim. 
3. Context 12 ("George VI") discusses George VI's activities as a monarch, but it does not mention the film or the actor. It is less relevant than Context 0 but still provides some context about the monarch. 
4. Context 8 ("List of English monarchs") provides general information about English monarchs but does not specifically address George VI or the film. It is less relevant compared to the other contexts.

# idx: [7, 0, 12, 8]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context with idx 7 ("The King's Speech") directly mentions "Colin Firth" and describes his role as King George VI in the movie, which is explicitly relevant to the claim and related to the reasoning steps. This context is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context with idx 0 ("George VI") provides background on George VI, the monarch at the end of World War II. While it doesn’t directly address the movie or the actor, it is relevant to the reasoning steps as it confirms the monarch's identity.
3. Context with idx 12 ("George VI") gives historical details about King George VI's activities but does not connect to "The King's Speech" or Colin Firth. Although it mentions George VI, its relevance to the claim is lower compared to the top two contexts.
4. Context with idx 8 ("List of English monarchs") is less relevant as it briefly describes monarchs in general and does not specifically address King George VI, the timeline of World War II, or "The King’s Speech."

Question:Who played king whose regal Name did Albert Adopt in the king's speech?
golden idx: [5, 7]
step-by-step think:  
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "What regnal name did Albert adopt? >>>> George VI"; "who played King George VI in the king's speech >>>> Colin Firth". Importance is placed on Albert adopting the name George VI and the portrayal of King George VI by Colin Firth in the film "The King's Speech".  
2. Evaluate relevance by checking which contexts refer to these entities and relationships: keywords like "George VI," "Albert," "The King's Speech," "Colin Firth" are prioritized.  
3. Assess informativeness based on how directly the context relates to answering whether Colin Firth played George VI in "The King's Speech".  
4. Check likelihood of containing the answer by analyzing whether the context explicitly mentions George VI, his adoption of the name, and/or the film portrayal.  
5. Rank the contexts by scoring them on relevance, informativeness, and likelihood, and select the top 16 based on these scores.  

idx: [5, 7, 6, 4, 0, 19, 8, 12, 18, 17, 16, 10, 3, 14, 13, 15]

# step-by-step think:
In order to rank the contexts, I will follow these steps:
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps:
   - The reasoning steps mention the regnal name "George VI" adopted by Albert, and Colin Firth playing King George VI in "The King's Speech."
   - Any context title or paragraph_text matching "George VI," "regnal name," "Albert," or describing events in "The King's Speech" is directly relevant.
2. Relevance to the claim:
   - Contexts explicitly talking about King George VI or the film "The King's Speech" are directly relevant.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer:
   - Preference will be given to contexts that are more likely to discuss the actor Colin Firth playing King George VI in the film, as well as those explaining Albert's adoption of the regnal name George VI.

Based on this:
- Context 5 is highly relevant as it directly mentions "The King's Speech" and Colin Firth playing King George VI.
- Context 7 discusses Albert adopting the regnal name "George VI," clearly addressing the first reasoning step.
- Context 4 mentions King George V, potentially providing background information but is less directly useful.
- Other contexts such as 6 and 19 do not focus on the regnal name "George VI" or "The King's Speech" but provide some tangential relevance.

# idx: [5, 7, 6, 4, 0, 19, 12, 3]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 5 ("The King's Speech") is highly relevant as it directly mentions Colin Firth playing King George VI in the film "The King's Speech." This context aligns perfectly with the reasoning steps and is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 7 ("George VI") is also highly relevant as it explains that Albert adopted the regnal name George VI, which is part of the reasoning steps. While it does not directly address who played George VI in the film, it provides essential background information.
3. Context 6 ("George VI") provides additional details about George VI's reign but does not directly address the claim or the reasoning steps. It is less relevant than Contexts 5 and 7 but still provides useful context about George VI.
4. Context 4 ("George V") mentions George V, the father of George VI, but does not directly relate to the claim or reasoning steps. It is less relevant than the other contexts but still provides some background information.

# idx: [5, 7, 6, 4]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 5: This context explicitly mentions "The King's Speech," providing detailed information about the movie and stating that Colin Firth played King George VI. It directly relates to the second reasoning step and contains the answer to the claim. It is highly relevant and informative.
2. Context idx 7: This context focuses on Albert adopting the regnal name "George VI" and provides background on why he chose the name. It directly addresses the first reasoning step and supports the claim but does not explicitly mention "The King's Speech" or Colin Firth.
3. Context idx 6: While this context discusses George VI, it primarily focuses on his North American tour in 1939 and does not contain information that answers the claim or is as relevant as idx 5 and 7.
4. Context idx 4: This context describes George V and is not directly relevant to the reasoning steps or the claim.

Question:Who played the king that was king of england in 1951 in the king's speech?
golden idx: [2, 16]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps refer to George VI, who was the King of England in 1951, and Colin Firth, who played George VI in the movie "The King's Speech." 
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on its match with these entities: The context should be about George VI, Colin Firth, or the movie "The King's Speech."
3. Calculate the informativeness score based on how well the context provides information about the claim, such as details of George VI, his reign in 1951, or Colin Firth's role in "The King's Speech."
4. Determine the likelihood that the context directly answers the claim: contexts discussing Colin Firth as the actor or directly referencing "The King's Speech" are highly likely to answer the question.
5. Combine these factors to rank the top 16 contexts.

idx: [16, 2, 10, 0, 3, 12, 13, 15, 7, 14, 19, 6, 8, 11, 9, 5]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts according to the given rules, I follow these steps: 1. First, I check if the contexts mention the entities or relationships from the reasoning steps - specifically "George VI" and "Colin Firth" or their roles such as "king of England in 1951" or "actor who played him in 'The King's Speech'". 2. I prioritize contexts that not only match these entities but also specifically address the claim of "Who played the king of England in 1951 in the king's speech?". 3. Contexts providing background information but less likely containing the answer receive lower scores. Based on these criteria, I will carefully rank the contexts.

# idx: [16, 2, 10, 0, 15, 3, 13, 19]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 16 ("The King's Speech") directly mentions Colin Firth playing King George VI in the film "The King's Speech." This context aligns perfectly with the reasoning steps and is highly relevant to the claim. It is very likely to contain the answer. 
2. Context 2 ("George VI") provides detailed information about King George VI, who was the King of England in 1951. This context is relevant to the reasoning steps and provides background information necessary to address the claim. 
3. Context 10 ("George VI") discusses King George VI's health and activities in 1951, which is relevant to the reasoning steps as it confirms his role as King of England during that time. However, it does not directly address the film or the actor. 
4. Context 15 ("List of English monarchs") provides general information about English monarchs but does not specifically address King George VI or the film. It is less directly relevant but still provides some context about English kings.

# idx: [16, 2, 10, 15]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 16 ("The King's Speech"): This context directly links to the claim by mentioning the movie "The King's Speech" and explicitly states that Colin Firth played King George VI. It aligns with the reasoning step to determine who played King George VI in the movie. This context is highly relevant, informative, and likely contains the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 2 ("George VI"): This context provides information about King George VI, confirming his reign from 1936 to 1952 and verifying that he was King of England in 1951. While it aligns with the first reasoning step, it does not address the movie aspect of the claim, thus making it relevant but not sufficient to answer the claim completely.
3. Context idx 10 ("George VI"): This context mentions events in the life of King George VI in 1951, including his declining health. While it corroborates the timeline for King George VI being the reigning king in 1951, it offers less direct relevance to the claim compared to the top two contexts.

Question:In A League of Their Own, who played the husband of the actress who played Thelma in Thelma and Louise?
golden idx: [5, 12]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Thelma in Thelma and Louise movie" refers to Geena Davis, and "Geena Davis' husband in A League of Their Own" refers to Bill Pullman. 
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. 
3. Contexts directly mentioning "Thelma & Louise," "Geena Davis," "A League of Their Own," or "Bill Pullman" are highly relevant. 
4. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on how relevant the context is to the claim. Contexts that provide information about the cast of "Thelma & Louise" or "A League of Their Own" are prioritized. 
5. Calculate the likelihood score for each context based on how likely the context may contain the answer to the claim. Contexts explicitly mentioning Geena Davis, Bill Pullman, or their roles in the respective movies are most likely to contain the answer. 
6. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to get the final score for each context. 
7. Rank the contexts based on the final scores and select the top 16 ranked contexts.

idx: [5, 12, 6, 15, 13, 14, 18, 19, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each based on the following criteria: 
1. Match to reasoning steps: The contexts will be prioritized if they align closely with the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. For example, reasoning steps mention Geena Davis (Thelma in "Thelma and Louise") and her husband character (Bob, played by Bill Pullman) in "A League of Their Own." Contexts with these names or strongly related content will rank higher. 
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts discussing key aspects of the claim, such as the movies or roles in question, will rank above tangential or unrelated texts. 
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Directly relevant information matching reasoning elements like cast or plot details is critical for ranking decisions.
Based on this evaluation, I will carefully prioritize the contexts.

Starting with reasoning step one, Geena Davis plays Thelma in "Thelma & Louise". Context 12 strongly confirms this. Reasoning step two addresses Bill Pullman as Geena Davis’s husband (Bob) in "A League of Their Own", which is heavily discussed in context 5. Contexts unrelated to either the films or their associated characters will rank lower.

- Context 5 ("A League of Their Own") explicitly discusses both the character Bob and his actor Bill Pullman, directly addressing the second reasoning step and linking Geena Davis's character to her husband, making it most critical.
- Context 12 ("Thelma & Louise") confirms Geena Davis as Thelma, addressing reasoning step one, thus highly relevant.
- Context 1 ("The Wiz (film)") and other contexts mentioning "Thelma" actors or characters not associated with "A League of Their Own" or "Thelma & Louise" (e.g., 18, 8) are less helpful to the claim resolution.

Prioritizing based on alignment with reasoning steps and relevance to the claim:
idx: [5, 12, 15, 18, 6, 0, 8, 19]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 5 ("A League of Their Own") is highly relevant as it directly mentions the character Bob, played by Bill Pullman, who is the husband of Dottie (Geena Davis) in the movie. This context aligns perfectly with the reasoning steps and is very likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 12 ("Thelma & Louise") is also highly relevant as it confirms that Geena Davis played Thelma in "Thelma & Louise," which is a key part of the reasoning steps. It provides essential information to establish the connection between the two movies.
3. Context 15 ("Female buddy film") mentions "Thelma & Louise" and its cultural impact but does not provide specific details about the cast or characters. While it is somewhat relevant, it is less likely to contain the answer compared to the first two contexts.
4. Context 6 ("The Proud and Profane") and other contexts like 18, 0, 8, and 19 are unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. They do not mention Geena Davis, Bill Pullman, or the movies in question, making them irrelevant.

# idx: [5, 12, 15, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 5 ("A League of Their Own"): The paragraph directly discusses characters in "A League of Their Own" and mentions "Dottie" waiting for her husband Bob, played by Bill Pullman. This context is highly relevant to the claim since it explicitly mentions the actor (Bill Pullman) who played Geena Davis's husband in the movie.

2. Context 12 ("Thelma & Louise"): This context identifies Geena Davis as the actress who played Thelma in "Thelma & Louise." This is highly relevant to the claim as it confirms the first step in the reasoning process and establishes part of the connection.

3. Context 15 ("Female buddy film"): While discussing "Thelma & Louise," it does not provide as much direct information relevant to the claim compared to Contexts 5 and 12. It only provides some background on the movie, which is less likely to help answer the claim directly.

4. Context 6 ("The Proud and Profane"): This context is unrelated to the claim and does not contribute to answering it. It discusses a different movie, so it is not relevant.

Question:In the movie A League of their Own, who played the husband of the person who also played Thelma in the movie Thelma and Louise?
golden idx: [5, 17]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the key entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: 
   - "who played Thelma in the movie Thelma and Louise" → Geena Davis.
   - "Geena Davis husband in A League of Their Own" → Bill Pullman.
2. Look for contexts that mention "Thelma & Louise," "Geena Davis," "A League of Their Own," and "Bill Pullman."
3. Context 5 directly mentions "Thelma & Louise" and Geena Davis as Thelma, making it highly relevant.
4. Context 17 discusses the plot of "A League of Their Own" and mentions the character Bob (Bill Pullman) as Dottie’s husband, directly answering part of the claim.
5. Contexts mentioning Geena Davis or Bill Pullman in other roles are less relevant but could provide additional information or corroborate the claim.
6. Rank based on the relevance to the reasoning steps and the likelihood of containing the answer to the claim, prioritizing contexts directly addressing the required entities and relationships.

# idx: [5, 17, 18, 7, 19, 4, 9, 14, 6, 3, 16, 8, 1, 2, 10, 11]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will apply the following rules systematically:  
1. **Match with Reasoning Steps**: Prioritize contexts whose titles or paragraph_text closely align with entities or relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps (e.g., "Geena Davis," "A League of Their Own," "Bill Pullman").  
2. **Relevance to Claim**: Ensure the contexts directly relate to the claim, which asks about a specific character played by Bill Pullman in relation to Geena Davis in *A League of Their Own*.  
3. **Likelihood of Containing the Answer**: Emphasize contexts that include detailed information about Geena Davis, Bill Pullman, and their roles in *A League of Their Own*.  

Now, I will assess the provided contexts:  
- Context 5 provides key information confirming that Geena Davis played Thelma in *Thelma & Louise*.  
- Context 17 details the storyline of *A League of Their Own* and explicitly mentions Geena Davis's character (Dottie) and her husband Bob (played by Bill Pullman). This is vital for resolving the claim.  
- Context 18 is irrelevant, as it diverges completely into unrelated biographical information.  
- Context 7, while discussing *Thelma & Louise*, does not specifically add information about Geena Davis in the context of the claim.  
- Context 19 lists relationships between characters in another series, irrelevant to the claim.  
- Contexts 4, 9, 14, and others mention unrelated films or actors (e.g., Thelma Ritter or other uses of "Thelma"). These are not connected to the reasoning steps or claim.  

Thus, the most relevant contexts focus on *A League of Their Own* and *Thelma & Louise*, the two key films in the claim.  

# idx: [17, 5, 7, 14, 9, 4, 6, 3]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 17 ("A League of Their Own"): This context directly mentions the movie "A League of Their Own" and includes information about Dottie's husband, Bob (played by Bill Pullman). This matches the reasoning step "Geena Davis husband in league of their own >>>> Bill Pullman" and is crucial to resolving the claim. It is highly relevant, informative, and likely to contain the answer.

2. Context 5 ("Thelma & Louise"): This context directly mentions the movie "Thelma & Louise" and confirms that Geena Davis played Thelma, addressing the reasoning step "who played thelma in the movie thelma and louise >>>> Geena Davis." It is relevant and provides critical information to establish the link to Geena Davis but does not directly discuss her role in "A League of Their Own."

3. Context 7 ("Female buddy film"): This context provides general information about female buddy films and mentions "Thelma & Louise" as a notable example. However, it does not add new or essential details about Geena Davis's role or the movie "A League of Their Own." It is less directly relevant or informative than the first two contexts.

4. Context 3 ("Where the Heart Is (2000 film)"): This context contains no mention of "Thelma & Louise," "A League of Their Own," Geena Davis, or Bill Pullman. Although it includes a character named "Thelma," it is unrelated to the claim and reasoning steps. It is the least relevant but included due to a weakly related name match.

# idx: [17, 5, 7, 3]

step-by-step think: 

1. Context "A League of Their Own" is highly relevant to the reasoning steps. It directly mentions "Dottie," her husband "Bob (Bill Pullman)," and provides clear information about the character played by Bill Pullman in the movie A League of Their Own. This aligns well with the second reasoning step about Geena Davis' husband in the movie, making it highly likely to contain the answer.  

2. Context "Thelma & Louise" directly addresses the first reasoning step regarding who played Thelma in the movie Thelma and Louise. It confirms that Geena Davis played the role of Thelma, making it highly relevant to the claim as well as the reasoning steps.

3. Context "Female buddy film" mentions Thelma and Louise in the context of female buddy films. It is less directly informative about the specific claim or reasoning steps compared to the previous contexts but still relates to Thelma & Louise, providing indirect relevance.

Question:What character in A League of their Own was played by the actress who played Thelma in the movie Thelma and Louise?
golden idx: [11, 15]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Extract the entities and relationships from the reasoning steps: "Geena Davis" played "Thelma" in "Thelma & Louise" and she also played "Dottie Hinson" in "A League of Their Own."
2. Identify the contexts that prominently mention Geena Davis, Thelma & Louise, A League of Their Own, or Dottie Hinson.
3. Prioritize contexts that are both relevant to the claim and reasoning steps, and are likely to provide the necessary information to address the claim (e.g., confirming the roles or connections of Geena Davis).
4. Rank the contexts based on relevance, informativeness, and their likelihood of containing the answer to the specific claim.

# idx: [15, 11, 12, 19, 6, 13, 7, 14, 17, 5, 10, 1, 9, 3, 16, 8]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the provided contexts:
1. I will look for matches between the context's titles or paragraph texts and the reasoning steps, such as mentions of "Geena Davis," "Thelma in Thelma and Louise," "Dottie Hinson," or "A League of Their Own." Contexts explicitly linking these terms will score higher.
2. I will evaluate the relevance of each context to the claim. The claim seeks to identify a character in "A League of Their Own" played by Geena Davis, so contexts that discuss either this movie, the role of Dottie Hinson, or Geena Davis's role as Thelma in "Thelma & Louise" are pivotal.
3. I will prioritize contexts that are most likely to directly contain information about the roles portrayed by Geena Davis in these movies.

# Ranking logic:
1. Context idx 15 discusses Geena Davis playing Thelma in "Thelma & Louise," directly addressing the first reasoning step, making it crucial for understanding the claim.
2. Context idx 11 mentions Geena Davis portraying Dottie Hinson in "A League of Their Own," directly addressing the second reasoning step and explicitly connecting to the claim.
3. The remaining contexts do not offer specific information about Geena Davis, "Thelma & Louise," or "A League of Their Own," so their relevance diminishes, and they are unlikely to contain the answer.

# Final ranking:
1. Context idx 11 ("A League of Their Own")—Explicitly mentions Geena Davis as Dottie Hinson, directly addressing both the claim and the second reasoning step.
2. Context idx 15 ("Thelma & Louise")—Details Geena Davis's role as Thelma, directly addressing the first reasoning step.
3. Contexts unrelated to the reasoning steps or claim, such as those focusing on other movies, characters, or Thelma references, are not included in the top ranks, as their relevance is negligible.

# idx: [11, 15]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will follow these steps: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention "Geena Davis," "Thelma in Thelma and Louise," and "Dottie Hinson in A League of Their Own." Contexts that explicitly mention these entities or relationships will score higher. 
2. Relevance to the claim: The claim asks about the character in "A League of Their Own" played by the actress who portrayed Thelma in "Thelma and Louise." Contexts directly addressing these movies, characters, or the actress will be prioritized. 
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that provide detailed information about Geena Davis, her roles, or the movies in question are more likely to contain the answer and will be ranked higher.

Based on these criteria:
- Context 15 explicitly mentions Geena Davis as Thelma in "Thelma & Louise," making it highly relevant to the reasoning step about who played Thelma.
- Context 11 mentions Geena Davis as Dottie Hinson in "A League of Their Own," directly addressing the second reasoning step.
- Context 6 discusses "Thelma & Louise" as a notable female buddy film, indirectly relevant to the claim.
- Other contexts mentioning unrelated uses of "Thelma" or unrelated movies are less relevant.

# idx: [15, 11, 6, 10, 9, 8, 16, 7]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 15 ("Thelma & Louise") directly mentions Geena Davis as Thelma, which aligns with the first reasoning step, "who played Thelma in the movie Thelma and Louise >>>> Geena Davis." This context is highly relevant and likely to contain part of the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 11 ("A League of Their Own") mentions Geena Davis playing Dottie Hinson, which aligns with the second reasoning step, "who did Geena Davis play in A League of Their Own >>>> Dottie Hinson." This context is also highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
3. Context 6 ("Female buddy film") mentions "Thelma & Louise" as a notable female buddy film but does not provide specific information about Geena Davis or her roles. While it is somewhat relevant, it is less likely to contain the answer compared to contexts 15 and 11. 
4. Context 10 ("Durham Bulls") is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps and does not mention any relevant entities or relationships. It is not likely to contain the answer.

Question:The actor who played Thelma in "Thelma and Louise" also played which character in "A League of Their Own"?
golden idx: [8, 19]
# step-by-step think: 
1. The reasoning steps contain two main entities: "Thelma & Louise" and "A League of Their Own," as well as a specific person, "Geena Davis," and the specific roles "Thelma" and "Dottie Hinson."
2. Identify contexts that mention Geena Davis or the movies "Thelma & Louise" or "A League of Their Own," as they are central to the claim.
3. Prioritize contexts mentioning Geena Davis's roles in these movies or mentioning relevant roles like Thelma or Dottie Hinson.
4. Rank higher those contexts that are more specific or likely to directly answer the question about the characters Geena Davis played.
5. Consider how closely paragraph content matches the reasoning steps and the claim to rank contexts by overall relevance and informativeness.
6. Select the top 16 ranked contexts that best meet these criteria.

# idx: [19, 8, 18, 0, 2, 14, 7, 16, 1, 3, 6, 11, 5, 12, 17, 9]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will consider the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps explicitly mention Geena Davis as the actress who played Thelma in "Thelma and Louise" and also as Dottie Hinson in "A League of Their Own." Contexts featuring details about either of these roles or films should rank highly.
2. Relevance to the claim: The claim focuses on Geena Davis and her roles in these two movies, so contexts about "Thelma & Louise" and "A League of Their Own" are highly relevant.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts providing detailed information about Geena Davis's roles in these films are most likely to contain the answer.

Step-by-step evaluation of contexts provided:
- Context 19 ("Thelma & Louise") directly addresses the reasoning step about Geena Davis playing Thelma, making it highly relevant and likely to contain related information. 
- Context 8 ("A League of Their Own") explicitly mentions Dottie Hinson played by Geena Davis, directly answering the second reasoning step.
- Context 18 ("Female buddy film") discusses "Thelma & Louise" as a notable film, which ties it indirectly to the reasoning steps and the claim.
- Contexts 0, 2, 14, 7, 16, 1, and others less directly discuss unrelated topics or characters, such as other uses of "Thelma," none of which are relevant to the claim about Geena Davis.
- Contexts unrelated to the claim or Geena Davis’s film roles (e.g., 3, 6, 11, 5, etc.) hold no potential to answer the question.

Following the detailed evaluation:
- The top contexts are those directly addressing Geena Davis in "Thelma & Louise" and "A League of Their Own."
idx: [19, 8, 18, 1, 0, 2, 5, 7]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context with `idx: 19` ("Thelma & Louise") is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Thelma and Louise," identifies Geena Davis as the actor who played Thelma, and begins answering the reasoning step: 'who played Thelma in Thelma and Louise movie >>>> Geena Davis.'. It is extremely likely this context contains essential information for the claim. 
2. The context with `idx: 8` ("A League of Their Own") explicitly mentions Geena Davis and provides the information that she played "Dottie Hinson" in "A League of Their Own." This directly connects to the reasoning step 'who did Geena Davis play in a league of their own >>>> Dottie Hinson' and is highly relevant for answering the claim. 
3. The context with `idx: 18` ("Female buddy film") mentions "Thelma and Louise" and provides background on the genre, connecting to the reasoning involving the film "Thelma and Louise," but it does not contribute as directly to the claim as the above contexts. 
4. The context with `idx: 1` ("Durham Bulls") mentions Susan Sarandon and films but does not mention Geena Davis or "Thelma and Louise" directly. It is less relevant than the top three for addressing the claim but is the next closest connection given the mention of related figures and films.

# idx: [19, 8, 18, 1]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 19 ("Thelma & Louise"): This context states that Geena Davis played Thelma in "Thelma & Louise," directly addressing the reasoning step about who played Thelma in that film. It is highly relevant to the claim and likely contains necessary information to connect Geena Davis to her role in "Thelma & Louise."
2. Context 8 ("A League of Their Own"): This context mentions Geena Davis and explicitly states that she played Dottie Hinson in "A League of Their Own." This directly answers the second reasoning step about Geena Davis' role in that movie and is critical to addressing the claim.
3. Context 18 ("Female buddy film"): While this mentions "Thelma & Louise" as a notable female buddy film, it does not provide specific information about the actors or their roles. It is less relevant than the other two contexts but still somewhat related to the claim's subject matter.

Question:Who is the sibling of the author of Kapalkundala?
golden idx: [4, 8]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Extract entities and relationships from the reasoning steps: 'Kapalkundala >> author >>>> Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay' and 'Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay >> sibling >>>> Sanjib Chandra'. Relevant keywords include 'Kapalkundala', 'Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay', and 'Sanjib Chandra'. 
2. Evaluate contexts based on how well their titles or paragraph_text match the entities ('Kapalkundala', 'Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay', 'Sanjib Chandra') or relationships ('author', 'sibling').
3. Assess the relevance of each context to the claim about identifying the sibling of the author of Kapalkundala.
4. Assess the likelihood that any context contains specific information about the sibling of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay.
5. Rank contexts by combining their scores for relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer.

# idx: [4, 8, 0, 6, 3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will:
# 1. Evaluate how well each context's title or paragraph_text matches the entities or relationships mentioned in the reasoning steps, such as "Kapalkundala," "Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay," and "Sanjib Chandra."
# 2. Assess the relevance of the context to the claim, specifically identifying Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay as the author of Kapalkundala and finding information about his sibling, Sanjib Chandra.
# 3. Consider how likely the context is to contain the answer about the sibling of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay.

# Ranking rationale:
# - Context 8 directly references "Kapalkundala" and its author Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, strongly linking to the reasoning step.
# - Context 4 is about Sanjib Chandra, the direct sibling of Bankim Chandra, providing critical information related to the claim.
# - The rest of the contexts do not align closely with the entities or relationships from the reasoning steps, nor do they contain information about Kapalkundala, its author, or his sibling. 

idx: [8, 4]

# step-by-step think:
In order to rank the contexts, I will evaluate them based on the following rules:

1. **Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps**: The reasoning steps indicate that "Kapalkundala" was authored by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, and the sibling relationship connects him to Sanjib Chandra. Therefore, contexts mentioning Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay or Sanjib Chandra are highly relevant. 
2. **Relevance to the claim**: The claim asks specifically for information regarding the sibling of the author of "Kapalkundala". Any context that directly pertains to Sanjib Chandra's relationship with Bankim Chandra or "Kapalkundala" should be prioritized.
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts are scored higher if they explicitly mention the authorship of "Kapalkundala", the biographical details of Sanjib Chandra, or relationships involving Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay.

Let us now identify and rank the contexts accordingly.

- Context 4 ("Sanjib Chandra Chattopadhyay") is highly relevant as it explicitly focuses on Sanjib Chandra, who is the sibling in question.
- Context 8 ("Kapalkundala") is highly relevant as it provides information about the author Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and his work "Kapalkundala".
- Context 3 and other generic mentions of siblings like 6, 0, and 2 are unrelated to Bankim Chandra and Sanjib Chandra, hence less relevant.
- Contexts without mention of the reasoning steps entities (e.g., context 5, context 14) are irrelevant to the claim.

# idx: [4, 8, 14, 1, 7, 15, 11, 13]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 8 ("Kapalkundala"): This context directly mentions "Kapalkundala" and identifies its author, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. It is highly relevant to the reasoning step "Kapalkundala >> author >>>> Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay" and likely contains foundational information related to the claim. 
2. Context 4 ("Sanjib Chandra Chattopadhyay"): This discusses Sanjib Chandra, who is identified in the reasoning step "Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay >> sibling >>>> Sanjib Chandra". Given its direct relevance to the sibling relationship, it is highly likely to contain the answer about Sanjib Chandra's relationship with Bankim Chandra.
3. Context 1 ("Catherine of Pfalz-Zweibrücken (1661–1720)"): This context mentions sibling relationships but is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. Though it is about siblings, it is not relevant to Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay or Kapalkundala.
4. Context 14 ("Kate Kellaway"): This context mentions sibling relationships in an unrelated context (Kate and Lucy Kellaway), which is irrelevant to the claim or reasoning steps.

Question:Who is the voice of the character in Spongebob Squarepants with the same name as the creature that annelid larvae live like?
golden idx: [1, 3]
# step-by-step think: 
1. The reasoning steps identify two key components: (i) "annelids' larvae live like plankton," and (ii) "who voices Plankton in SpongeBob SquarePants, which is Mr. Lawrence." 
2. I need to find contexts containing information about what annelid larvae live like (plankton) and contexts that specify the voice actor for the character Plankton in SpongeBob SquarePants, named Mr. Lawrence. 
3. I will prioritize contexts with titles or content explicitly referring to these entities or relationships, such as "Plankton," "SpongeBob SquarePants cast members," or "Annelid." 
4. Relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer to the claim will be assessed. Contexts closely matching this specific question will score higher. 
5. Rankings will focus on combining the matches to the reasoning steps and likelihood of resolving the claim.

# idx: [3, 1, 15, 6, 17, 18, 5, 0, 8, 9, 4, 7, 19, 12, 2, 11]

# step-by-step think:
To rank the contexts, let’s follow the rules systematically:  
1. **Match with reasoning steps**: The key entities and relationships are “annelids' larvae live like plankton,” and “Plankton’s voice in SpongeBob SquarePants is Mr. Lawrence.” Therefore, contexts that discuss "plankton," "SpongeBob SquarePants," "Plankton," and "Mr. Lawrence" are prioritized.  
2. **Relevance to the claim**: The claim seeks information about the voice actor of the "Plankton" character in SpongeBob SquarePants. Contexts must focus on voice actors or SpongeBob-specific connections.  
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts explicitly linking “Plankton” to “Mr. Lawrence” or detailing the role of "Mr. Lawrence" in SpongeBob will rank higher.

### Context Ranking:
- **Context 1 (idx: 1)**: Contains a clear list connecting "Mr. Lawrence" to "Plankton" and SpongeBob SquarePants, satisfying both reasoning steps and high claim relevance.  
- **Context 15 (idx: 15)**: Details about Douglas Lawrence Osowski (Mr. Lawrence) and his association with SpongeBob, reinforcing his connection to voicing "Plankton."  
- **Context 3 (idx: 3)**: Discusses the link between annelid larvae and plankton. It is critical for completing the reasoning steps about why "Plankton" is relevant here.  
- **Context 6 (idx: 6)**: Details the voice cast from The SpongeBob Movie, confirming Mr. Lawrence as the voice of "Plankton."  
- **Context 17 (idx: 17)**: Similar to idx 6, outlines the voice cast, including Mr. Lawrence as "Plankton."  
- **Context 19 (idx: 19)**: Mentions Mr. Lawrence as part of the SpongeBob voice cast, creating a link to "Plankton."  
- **Context 7 (idx: 7)**: Provides overall information about SpongeBob SquarePants but does not specify the role of "Plankton" or Mr. Lawrence.  
- **Context 18 (idx: 18)**: Offers peripheral details on a SpongeBob movie but does not directly address the reasoning chain or claim. 

Other contexts like idx 4 or idx 5 are less relevant as they do not address either the reasoning steps or focus on claim-related roles.  

### Final Ranking:
idx: [1, 15, 3, 6, 17, 19, 7, 18]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 3 ("Annelid") is highly relevant as it directly explains that annelid larvae live as plankton, which is a key reasoning step in the claim. This context is essential for understanding the connection between annelids and plankton. 
2. Context 1 ("List of SpongeBob SquarePants cast members") explicitly mentions Mr. Lawrence as the voice of Plankton, directly addressing the second reasoning step and the claim. It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
3. Context 15 ("Mr. Lawrence") provides detailed information about Mr. Lawrence, including his role as a voice actor in SpongeBob SquarePants. While it does not explicitly mention Plankton, it is still relevant to the claim.
4. Context 6 ("The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water") also mentions Mr. Lawrence as the voice of Plankton, making it relevant to the claim. However, it is slightly less comprehensive than Context 1 in terms of listing the cast.

# idx: [3, 1, 15, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 3 ("Annelid"): This context directly addresses the first reasoning step, explaining that annelid larvae live as plankton. It is highly relevant to the claim and provides foundational information for the inference process. 
2. Context 1 ("List of SpongeBob SquarePants cast members"): This context explicitly mentions Mr. Lawrence as the voice of Plankton in SpongeBob SquarePants, directly addressing the second reasoning step. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. Context 15 ("Mr. Lawrence"): This context provides background information about Mr. Lawrence, including his role as a voice actor for SpongeBob SquarePants. While it is relevant, it is less specific to the claim compared to Context 1, as it does not explicitly link him to Plankton.
4. Context 6 ("The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water"): This context mentions Mr. Lawrence as the voice of Plankton but is less focused on the claim compared to Context 1, as it is embedded within a broader discussion of the movie's cast.

Question:The actor who plays the girl in Spiderman Homecoming is signed to which record label?
golden idx: [12, 16]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: 
   - "Who plays the girl in Spider-Man Homecoming" → Zendaya.
   - "Zendaya" → record label → Hollywood Records.
2. Analyze the relevance of each context:
   - Contexts explicitly mentioning Zendaya or her role in "Spider-Man: Homecoming" are highly relevant.
   - Contexts discussing record labels, particularly Hollywood Records, are also highly relevant.
3. Score the contexts based on their informativeness:
   - Relevant contexts that provide direct information about Zendaya's acting or singing career are more likely to answer the claim.
   - Contexts about Spider-Man: Homecoming are somewhat useful to help connect Zendaya to her role.
4. Rank the contexts based on relevance to the claim and likelihood of containing the answer:
   - The context about Zendaya's debut album with Hollywood Records is highly relevant (context 16).
   - Any other context mentioning Zendaya or her involvement in Spider-Man: Homecoming is secondary.
5. Select the top 16 contexts based on relevance and likelihood of answering the claim.

# idx: [16, 6, 12, 7, 9, 3, 18, 19, 4, 10, 0, 17, 5, 2, 1, 11]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, these steps will be followed:
1. **Match with entities or relationships from Reasoning Steps**: The reasoning steps mention entities like "Zendaya," "Spider-Man Homecoming", and the relationship "record label Hollywood Records." Therefore, contexts mentioning Zendaya, Spider-Man: Homecoming, or Hollywood Records will score higher.
2. **Relevance to the claim**: The claim connects Zendaya (referred to as "the girl in Spider-Man: Homecoming") with the question about her record label. Thus, contexts providing this connection (e.g., Zendaya’s work in Spider-Man and her signing with a record label) will have higher relevance and scores.
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts directly discussing Zendaya, her roles, and her music career will be more likely to contain the information about her record label and will be prioritized accordingly.

Scores and notes for ranking:
- Context **idx 16** is the most relevant as it confirms Zendaya's association with Hollywood Records and mentions her signing a recording contract. It directly aligns with "Zendaya >> record label" reasoning step.
- Context **idx 12** explicitly links Zendaya to Spider-Man: Homecoming and describes her role, confirming her participation in the film (supporting "who plays the girl in Spider-Man Homecoming").
- Context **idx 6** mentions Zendaya in Spider-Man: Homecoming, reinforcing the link to the claim but lacks direct information about her record label.
- Context **idx 7** is similar to idx 6 as it lists Zendaya in Spider-Man: Homecoming and discusses the film but does not mention her record label.
- Context **idx 9** includes Zendaya in the cast details for Spider-Man: Homecoming, supporting the first step of reasoning ("who plays the girl in Spider-Man Homecoming >>>> Zendaya").
- Context **idx 1**, while related to Spider-Man's development, lacks mention of Zendaya or her record label and gets a lower score.
- Context **idx 19**, discussing the Marvel Cinematic Universe and films like Spider-Man: Homecoming, contributes minor relevance to the claim but lacks specificity about Zendaya or her music.
- Context **idx 5** is unrelated to Zendaya, Spider-Man: Homecoming, or Hollywood Records; therefore, it gets the lowest score among reviewed.

# idx: [16, 12, 6, 7, 9, 19, 3, 1]

step-by-step think: 
1. Context 16 ("Zendaya (album)"): This context directly relates to the reasoning step "Zendaya >> record label >>>> Hollywood Records." It explicitly mentions Zendaya signing a recording contract with Hollywood Records. This makes it highly relevant to the claim and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 12 ("Spider-Man: Homecoming"): This context confirms Zendaya played the girl (Michelle "MJ" Jones) in "Spider-Man: Homecoming," aligning with the reasoning step "who plays the girl in Spider-Man: Homecoming >>>> Zendaya." Though less likely to directly answer the claim, it confirms a critical entity (Zendaya).
3. Context 6 ("Spider-Man: Homecoming"): Similarly, this context mentions Zendaya's role in "Spider-Man: Homecoming." While it supports the reasoning step identifying Zendaya, it does not mention her association with Hollywood Records. Hence, it is slightly less relevant than context 12.
4. Context 7 ("Spider-Man: Homecoming"): This context is very similar to context 6, confirming Zendaya's role in "Spider-Man: Homecoming," establishing her as the actor in question. However, like context 6, it does not provide information about her record label.

idx: [16, 12, 6, 7]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with `idx: 16` ("Zendaya (album)") directly mentions Zendaya and her recording contract with Hollywood Records, which aligns precisely with the reasoning step "Zendaya >> record label >>>> Hollywood Records". This context is highly relevant and most likely to contain the answer.
2. Context with `idx: 12` ("Spider-Man: Homecoming") provides specific information about Zendaya’s role in the movie and mentions her as a cast member. This partially supports the reasoning step "who plays the girl in Spider-Man Homecoming >>>> Zendaya" and thus ranks second in relevance.
3. Context with `idx: 6` ("Spider-Man: Homecoming") briefly mentions Zendaya as part of the cast, which supports identifying her as "the girl" in Spider-Man Homecoming but does not delve further into her record label. It is moderately relevant but less likely to contain the answer compared to the top two contexts.

Question:What is the record label of the co-writer and recording artist of Permission to Fly?
golden idx: [7, 18]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: The key entities and relationships include "Permission to Fly," "Jordan Pruitt," and "Hollywood Records."
2. Search for contexts that explicitly mention Jordan Pruitt, Permission to Fly, or Hollywood Records in their title or paragraph text.
3. Evaluate the relevance of each context to the reasoning steps and claim. Contexts that specify the record label or provide explicit information about the recording artist and the album are given higher priority.
4. Assess the informativeness of the content and how likely it is to directly contain the answer (the record label of Jordan Pruitt for the album Permission to Fly).
5. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to rank the contexts. Select the top 16 based on these scores.

# idx: [7, 18, 6, 10, 2, 5, 13, 11, 12, 16, 14, 17, 0, 1, 15, 4]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will evaluate them based on these criteria: 
1. **Match with reasoning steps:** The reasoning steps specifically mention "Jordan Pruitt" as the co-writer and recording artist of "Permission to Fly," and her record label as "Hollywood Records." Contexts directly referencing these entities will receive higher scores.
2. **Relevance to the claim:** The claim seeks the record label of Jordan Pruitt, so contexts discussing her record label or albums will be most relevant.
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer:** Contexts explicitly connecting Jordan Pruitt to Hollywood Records are the most likely to contain the answer.

- Context 18 explicitly mentions Jordan Pruitt's debut album and associates it with Hollywood Records. This directly matches both the reasoning steps and the claim, making it top-ranked.
- Context 7 discusses "Permission to Fly," confirming Jordan Pruitt as the artist, which supports the first part of the reasoning step. However, it does not mention Hollywood Records.
- Other contexts (e.g., 6, 10, 12) describe unrelated record labels and provide no connection to Jordan Pruitt or the claim, so they are less relevant.

# idx: [18, 7, 13, 10, 6, 12, 2, 17]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 18: This mentions Jordan Pruitt and explicitly connects her to Hollywood Records. Since the reasoning steps link Jordan Pruitt to her record label and Hollywood Records is identified, this is highly relevant, informative, and likely contains the answer.
2. Context 7: This discusses "Permission to Fly" and identifies Jordan Pruitt as the recording artist. It is directly related to the reasoning steps and supports the inference process but does not explicitly mention Hollywood Records.
3. Context 13: This context, although about Graeme Goodall and record labels, does not mention Jordan Pruitt or Hollywood Records. It is less relevant compared to the first two contexts.
4. Context 10: While it involves a record label, this is unrelated to Jordan Pruitt or Hollywood Records. It is much less relevant and carries a low likelihood of containing the answer.

# idx: [18, 7, 13, 10]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context with index 18 discusses Jordan Pruitt and explicitly mentions Hollywood Records in relation to her debut album. Since the reasoning steps link Jordan Pruitt to Hollywood Records and the claim asks about the record label of the artist of "Permission to Fly," this context is highly relevant and informative.
2. The context with index 7 specifically talks about "Permission to Fly" and confirms Jordan Pruitt as the artist. While it does not explicitly mention the record label, it directly pertains to the claim and complements the first reasoning step ("Jordan Pruitt co-wrote and recorded Permission to Fly").
3. The context with index 13 mentions general information about record labels, but it is unrelated to Jordan Pruitt or "Permission to Fly." It does not strongly connect to the claim or reasoning steps.
4. The context with index 10 discusses Hamburg Records, which is unrelated to Jordan Pruitt, "Permission to Fly," or Hollywood Records. It is not relevant to the claim or reasoning steps.

2. Evaluate relevance for each context title and paragraph_text against "James Harden," "NBA scoring title," and "Oklahoma City Thunder."
3. Consider contexts explicitly mentioning James Harden's achievements or history, particularly his scoring titles or drafting team, as directly informative of the claim.
4. Combine relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the claim's answer to rank the contexts.
5. Rank and select the top 16 contexts accordingly.

# idx: [18, 3, 8, 1, 0, 11, 7, 19, 12, 4, 14, 10, 6, 5, 15, 13]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts:
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention that James Harden won the NBA scoring title and was drafted by the Oklahoma City Thunder. Contexts that reference James Harden and his association with the Oklahoma City Thunder will score highly.
2. Relevance to the claim: The claim seeks to identify the team that drafted the NBA scoring leader. Relevant contexts will provide information about James Harden, his scoring leadership, or the team that drafted him.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts explicitly mentioning James Harden's draft information or his association with the Oklahoma City Thunder will rank highest, followed by those addressing his scoring title.

step-by-step think: 

1. Context with idx 18 ("List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders"): This context mentions James Harden as the most recent scoring champion, directly addressing the first reasoning step in the chain about the NBA scoring title winner this year. It is highly relevant and likely contains part of the answer to the claim.  

2. Context with idx 3 ("2012–13 Houston Rockets season"): This mentions James Harden's history with the Oklahoma City Thunder. It ties directly to the second reasoning step about Harden being drafted by the Thunder, making it both highly relevant and informative in connecting Harden to the drafting team.

3. Context with idx 0 ("NBA draft"): This provides a general background on how the draft functions in the NBA. While it does not directly speak to Harden or the scoring title winner, it may still provide broader information relevant to the claim. 

4. Context with idx 12 ("NBA high school draftees"): Although more tangential to the claim, this context mentions NBA players who were impactful draftees. This could provide minor supplementary context, but it is less directly tied to James Harden or the scoring title.

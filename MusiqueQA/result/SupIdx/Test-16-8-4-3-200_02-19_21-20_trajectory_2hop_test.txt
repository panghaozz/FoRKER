step-by-step think:
1. In the first reasoning step, the entity "Solgränd" is mentioned, which refers to an alley in Stockholm. So, any context that mentions "Solgränd" or "Stockholm" would be relevant.
2. In the second reasoning step, the relationship "the Sun discovered to be the center of the solar system" is mentioned. So, any context that mentions "the Sun" or "discovery of the solar system" would be relevant.

Based on these reasoning steps, I will rank the contexts as follows:
1. Context with index 14: It mentions "Solgränd" in the title and is directly related to the claim.
2. Context with index 2: It mentions "the Sun" in the title and provides detailed information about it.
3. Context with index 9: It mentions "solar energy" and provides information about harnessing solar energy.

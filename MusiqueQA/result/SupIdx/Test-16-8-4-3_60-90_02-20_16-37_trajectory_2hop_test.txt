Question:What event caused the founder of Australia's liberal party to become Prime Minister?
golden idx: [5, 17]
step-by-step think: 
1. The reasoning steps indicate the following key entities and relationships:
   - "Australia's liberal party," founded by "Robert Menzies."
   - Robert Menzies becoming Prime Minister due to "Lyons' death in 1939."
2. Evaluate each context for relevance to these entities and relationships:
   - Contexts that explicitly reference the Liberal Party of Australia or Robert Menzies are highly relevant.
   - Contexts that discuss Joseph Lyons and his death in 1939 are also very relevant.
   - Contexts that indirectly mention Australia's prime ministers may have moderate relevance.
3. Assess informativeness based on whether the context directly mentions events leading to Menzies becoming Prime Minister or the Liberal Party's foundation.
4. Evaluate the likelihood of each context containing the answer by examining how directly the information matches the reasoning steps.
5. Rank the contexts based on the combination of relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores while favoring those most likely to provide a clear answer to the claim.

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will follow these criteria:  
1. **Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps**: The reasoning steps include "Robert Menzies" as the founder of Australia's Liberal Party and his becoming PM due to "Lyons' death in 1939." The contexts mentioning these entities/relationships will score higher.  
2. **Relevance to the claim**: Contexts directly explaining the event that caused Robert Menzies to become Prime Minister or his background with the Liberal Party will score higher.  
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts providing historical or political details about Robert Menzies, Joseph Lyons, or the transition of power in 1939 are more likely to contain the answer.  

Applying these criteria to the given contexts:  

- **Context 17**: Explicitly mentions "Lyons' death in 1939" leading to "Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership." Highly relevant to the claim and reasoning steps.  
- **Context 2**: Provides details about Joseph Lyons' leadership and his death in 1939. Related to the reasoning steps and claim.  
- **Context 5**: Discusses Robert Menzies as the founder of the Liberal Party and his philosophy. Covers part of the reasoning steps but lacks details about the transition in 1939.  
- **Context 18**: Talks about Robert Menzies' later leadership and dominance but does not discuss Lyons' death or becoming PM.  
- **Context 6, 4, 3, 10, 8, 0, 15, 1, 12, etc.**: Irrelevant to the claim or reasoning steps, as they discuss other political figures, countries, or events without mentioning Menzies, Lyons, or 1939.  

Finally, I will rank contexts by relevance to the claim and likelihood of containing the answer.  

# idx: [17, 2, 5, 18, 12, 16, 1, 0]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 17 ("Liberal Party of Australia"): This context mentions both Robert Menzies and Joseph Lyons, key figures in the reasoning steps. It directly addresses Lyons' death in 1939 as the event that caused Menzies to assume the position of Prime Minister, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 2 ("Lyons Government"): This context discusses Joseph Lyons and mentions his death in 1939, which aligns with the reasoning step regarding the event that caused Menzies to become Prime Minister. It is relevant but provides slightly less information than context 17. 
3. Context 5 ("Liberal Party of Australia"): This describes Robert Menzies as the founder of Australia's Liberal Party, directly addressing one part of the reasoning steps. However, it does not mention the event that led to him becoming Prime Minister, making it less comprehensive compared to context 17 and 2.
4. Context 18 ("History of Australia"): This mentions Robert Menzies as Prime Minister but focuses on his post-war achievements and political dominance rather than his rise to the position. While it provides context about Menzies, it is less directly tied to the reasoning steps than the top-ranked contexts.

# idx: [17, 2, 5, 18]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 17 ("Liberal Party of Australia"): This context mentions both the founder of Australia's liberal party, Robert Menzies, and explicitly states that he became Prime Minister following the death of Joseph Lyons in 1939. It directly aligns with the reasoning step "What event caused Robert Menzies to become Prime Minister? >>>> Lyons' death in 1939" and is most relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 2 ("Lyons Government"): This context discusses the death of Joseph Lyons in 1939 and its significance within Australian politics. While it doesn't explicitly connect this event to Robert Menzies assuming the Prime Ministership, it provides useful background and is somewhat relevant to the event described in the reasoning steps.
3. Context 18 ("History of Australia"): This context provides general information about Robert Menzies and his later domination of Australian politics with the Liberal Party. While informative, it is less directly relevant to the specific reasoning steps involving Lyons' death and its role in Menzies becoming Prime Minister.
4. Context 5 ("Liberal Party of Australia"): Although it mentions Robert Menzies as the founder of the party, it focuses more on his vision and the principles of the party, rather than the event that led him to become Prime Minister. Thus, it is less relevant than the others.

Question:What event caused the Liberal Party of Australia's longest-serving leader to become Prime Minister?
golden idx: [10, 17]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: Liberal Party of Australia, longest-serving leader, Robert Menzies, event, Lyons' death in 1939. 
2. Examine each context for the presence of these entities and relationships. Assess how closely the context aligns with the reasoning steps.
3. Evaluate how relevant the context is to the claim (i.e., what event caused Menzies to become Prime Minister). Contexts discussing Robert Menzies, his political career, or the events surrounding Lyons' death should rank higher. 
4. Determine the likelihood of each context containing the answer: Contexts explicitly mentioning Menzies' political rise, Lyons' death in 1939, or related significant events are most likely to contain the answer.
5. Combine these criteria (relevance to reasoning steps, informativeness regarding the claim, and likelihood of containing the answer) to rank the contexts and select the top 16.

idx: [17, 10, 7, 1, 13, 16, 8, 12, 9, 11, 5, 15, 4, 19, 6, 14]

# step-by-step think: 
In order to rank the contexts, I will consider the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention "Robert Menzies," "Liberal Party of Australia," and "Lyons' death in 1939." Contexts that directly mention these entities or events will score higher. 
2. Relevance to the claim: The claim asks about the event that caused Robert Menzies to become Prime Minister. Contexts that discuss Lyons' death in 1939 and its connection to Menzies becoming Prime Minister will be prioritized. 
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that explicitly describe the circumstances of Lyons' death and Menzies' assumption of the Prime Ministership are more likely to contain the answer.

Based on these criteria:
- Context 17 explicitly mentions Lyons' death in 1939 and Robert Menzies assuming the Prime Ministership, making it highly relevant.
- Context 10 discusses Robert Menzies as the founder and longest-serving leader of the Liberal Party, which aligns with the reasoning steps but does not directly address the event.
- Context 7 mentions Robert Menzies as the longest-serving Prime Minister and his political dominance but does not discuss the event that caused him to become Prime Minister.
- Context 13 mentions a different Prime Minister (Frank Forde) who served after a death, but it is unrelated to Lyons or Menzies.
- Other contexts (e.g., 16, 8, 12, 9, etc.) are unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps.

# idx: [17, 10, 7, 13, 1, 19, 15, 4]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context idx 17 ("Liberal Party of Australia"): This context is highly relevant as it directly mentions the death of Joseph Lyons in 1939 and Robert Menzies assuming the role of Prime Minister, aligning perfectly with the reasoning step concerning what event caused Menzies to become Prime Minister.
2. Context idx 10 ("Liberal Party of Australia"): This context discusses Robert Menzies as the founder and longest-serving leader of the Liberal Party. While it establishes his association with the party, it does not explicitly address the event in question, making it less relevant than idx 17.
3. Context idx 7 ("History of Australia"): This context mentions Robert Menzies' tenure as Prime Minister and his political dominance in Australia but does not directly address how he became Prime Minister, making it moderately relevant.
4. Context idx 13 ("Frank Forde"): This context discusses another Australian Prime Minister (Frank Forde) and his succession under different circumstances but is less relevant to the claim about Robert Menzies and Lyons' death. 
5. The remaining contexts (e.g., idx 1, idx 19, idx 15, idx 4) are unrelated to Robert Menzies, the Liberal Party, or the specific event of Lyons' death. Hence, they are not ranked.

# idx: [17, 10, 7, 13]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context "idx: 17": This context specifically mentions the Liberal Party of Australia, Joseph Lyons, and Robert Menzies. It clearly identifies Lyons' death in 1939 as the event that led to Menzies becoming Prime Minister, which directly addresses the claim. It is highly relevant and highly likely to contain the answer to the claim, making it the top choice.
2. Context "idx: 10": While this context mentions Robert Menzies and his role as the founder and longest-serving leader of the Liberal Party, it does not specifically address the event that led to him becoming Prime Minister. It is relevant but less specific to the claim than context 17.
3. Context "idx: 7": This context discusses the dominance of Robert Menzies and the Liberal Party in post-war Australia but does not directly address how or why Menzies became Prime Minister. It is partially relevant but less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to the other contexts.
4. Context "idx: 13": This context discusses a different Prime Minister, Francis Michael Forde, and his brief tenure. It is unrelated to the claim and does not mention Robert Menzies or the Liberal Party of Australia, making it the least relevant and unlikely to contain the answer.

Question:What was the average per capita GVA in 2013 of the country which created Burma's academic system?
golden idx: [10, 15]
# step-by-step think:
1. Breakdown the reasoning steps into key entities and relationships:
   - First step ("What country is Burma to credit for its academic system >>>> United Kingdom's"):
     - Relevant entities: Burma, United Kingdom, academic system.
   - Second step ("What was United Kingdom's average per capita GVA in 2013? >>>> £23,755"):
     - Relevant entities and terms: United Kingdom, average per capita GVA, 2013, £23,755.
2. Prioritize contexts that mention the United Kingdom, GVA (Gross Value Added), per capita information, or have details on Burma's academic system.
3. Calculate relevance based on direct mention of these entities and concepts in the title or paragraph_text.
4. Assess informativeness by judging how directly the context sheds light on the United Kingdom's per capita GVA or its academic influence on Burma.
5. Evaluate the likelihood of the context containing an answer closely related to the claim.
6. Rank contexts based on relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores. Select the top 16 ranked contexts.

# idx: [10, 15, 8, 0, 5, 9, 7, 14, 1, 19, 12, 4, 11, 13, 3, 17]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will follow these rules: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The entities and relationships to focus on are "Burma's (Myanmar's) academic system being based on the United Kingdom's system" and "United Kingdom's average per capita GVA in 2013 (£23,755)." I will prioritize contexts containing specific mentions of the United Kingdom's academic system or GVA information.
2. Relevance to the claim: The contexts that connect directly to the claim, such as information about Burma's academic system or GVA in 2013 for the UK specifically, will rank higher.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts providing direct numerical or qualitative evidence about the UK’s GVA in 2013 or clarifying the relationship between Myanmar and the United Kingdom's academic system will receive a higher score.

Using these criteria:
- Context 10 references that Myanmar's education system is based on the United Kingdom's system, establishing a clear connection to the reasoning steps about the country influencing Burma's system.
- Context 15 provides exact information about the UK's national average GVA in 2013 (£23,755) and is directly relevant to the second reasoning step.
- Context 9, 1, 8, and others appear unrelated to the entities or claim as they lack mentions of either the UK’s GVA or its academic influence on Myanmar.
- Context 8 talks about average household income in the UK, not specifically about GVA, so it is partially related but less relevant.
  
# idx: [10, 15, 8, 7, 14, 4, 13, 12]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 10 ("Myanmar"): This context directly mentions that Myanmar's education system is based on the United Kingdom's system, which aligns with the reasoning step "What country is Burma to credit for its academic system? >>>> United Kingdom's." It directly addresses the claim and provides relevant information.
2. Context 15 ("Plymouth"): This context mentions the UK's average per capita GVA in 2013 as £23,755, which directly corresponds to the reasoning step "What was United Kingdom's average per capita GVA in 2013? >>>> £23,755." It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. Context 8 ("Income in the United Kingdom"): This context provides detailed economic data about the United Kingdom, which could be relevant in understanding average income figures. While it does not directly mention GVA, it aligns with the reasoning steps by discussing UK economic information.
4. Context 7 ("Chile"): Although not directly relevant to the claim or reasoning steps, it contains economic data and touches upon national performance metrics. However, it is far less likely to provide the answer compared to the above contexts.

# idx: [10, 15, 8, 7]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 10 ("Myanmar"): This context directly addresses the first reasoning step by stating that Myanmar's (Burma's) education system is based on the United Kingdom's system due to British influence. It is highly relevant to the claim and provides foundational information for the reasoning process. 
2. Context 15 ("Plymouth"): This context explicitly mentions the United Kingdom's average per capita GVA in 2013 (£23,755), which directly addresses the second reasoning step. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.
3. Context 8 ("Income in the United Kingdom"): While this context discusses income-related statistics in the United Kingdom, it does not specifically mention GVA or the year 2013. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the exact answer compared to Context 15.
4. Context 7 ("Chile"): This context is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps, as it discusses Chile's economy and development. It is not relevant to the claim.

Question:Who is the spouse of the creator of The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember?
golden idx: [11, 19]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships from the reasoning steps:
   - "The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember" and its creator Fran Drescher.
   - Fran Drescher and her spouse Peter Marc Jacobson.
2. Evaluate each context for the presence of these entities or relationships:
   - Contexts directly mentioning Fran Drescher, Peter Marc Jacobson, and "The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember" are prioritized.
   - Contexts with broader mentions of Fran Drescher or Peter Marc Jacobson, or related works (e.g., television shows created by them), are moderately relevant.
   - Contexts unrelated to these entities or relationships are less relevant.
3. Calculate relevance based on matching entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.
4. Assess informativeness by determining how central the context is to the claim.
5. Evaluate likelihood by determining the probability that the context contains the required answer.
6. Rank the contexts using a combined score of relevance, informativeness, and likelihood, and select the top 16.

idx: [11, 19, 12, 3, 8, 5, 7, 10, 14, 18, 9, 16, 17, 4, 13, 15]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will follow these criteria:
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: I will identify contexts that explicitly mention 'The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember,' 'Fran Drescher,' and her spouse 'Peter Marc Jacobson' as they are central to the reasoning steps.
2. Relevance to the claim: I will prioritize contexts that are likely to provide information about the creator of "The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember" (Fran Drescher) and details regarding her spouse.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts mentioning Fran Drescher's marital details or creations involving Peter Marc Jacobson are more likely to contain the answer.

Given these criteria:
- Context 11 mentions "The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember" and Fran Drescher, making it a strong match.
- Context 19 provides explicit details about Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson, directly linking them as spouses.
- Other contexts (e.g., 12, 3) either mention individuals or works unrelated to the claim or do not mention Fran Drescher's spouse, so they are deprioritized.

# idx: [19, 11, 12, 3, 13, 10, 7, 5]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 19 ("List of Happily Divorced episodes"): This context mentions both Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson as co-creators of "Happily Divorced" and discusses their real-life relationship, including their marriage and divorce. It aligns directly with the reasoning step specifying Fran Drescher's spouse, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.  
2. Context with idx 11 ("The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember"): This context pertains directly to "The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember." While it doesn't directly address Fran Drescher's spouse or include details about Peter Marc Jacobson, it connects to the reasoning steps through the claim about the show.  
3. Context with idx 12 ("Ann Hampton Callaway"): This context mentions "The Nanny" and Ann Hampton Callaway's contribution to the series. While it connects indirectly to Fran Drescher through "The Nanny," it does not specifically discuss her or her spouse.  
4. Context with idx 3 ("Michael Rowe"): This context discusses Michael Rowe's work on "The Nanny," connecting it indirectly to Fran Drescher. However, it is less related to the specified claim or reasoning steps.  

# idx: [19, 11, 12, 3]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 19 provides strong relevance as it directly mentions Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson, explicitly linking Drescher to her spouse, Jacobson, and providing additional context about their personal life and co-creation of a TV series. This is highly relevant to the given reasoning steps and the claim.
2. Context with idx 11 mentions Fran Drescher, who is key to the reasoning steps, but it does not provide information about her spouse. While relevant, it is less likely to contain the answer compared to idx 19.
3. Context with idx 12 and idx 3 are less relevant. Context idx 12 discusses Ann Hampton Callaway and her connection to "The Nanny" theme song, which is tangentially connected to Fran Drescher but not likely to address the claim. Context idx 3 discusses Michael Rowe and his work on "The Nanny," but it does not connect to Fran Drescher or her spouse.

Question:Who founded the publisher of The Final Testament of the Holy Bible?
golden idx: [3, 8]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible >> publisher >>>> Gagosian Gallery" and "Gagosian Gallery >> founded by >>>> Larry Gagosian."
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. Contexts mentioning "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible," "Gagosian Gallery," or "Larry Gagosian" are highly relevant.
3. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on how relevant the context is to the claim. Contexts that directly mention the publisher of "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible" or the founder of Gagosian Gallery are prioritized.
4. Calculate the likelihood score for each context based on how likely the context may contain the answer to the claim. Contexts explicitly linking "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible" to "Gagosian Gallery" or "Larry Gagosian" are given higher scores.
5. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to get the final score for each context.
6. Rank the contexts based on the final scores and select the top 16 ranked contexts.

idx: [8, 3, 0, 4, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, the following criteria are considered: 1. Match with entities or relationships in reasoning steps. The reasoning steps involve 'The Final Testament of the Holy Bible', its publisher 'Gagosian Gallery', and that 'Gagosian Gallery' was founded by 'Larry Gagosian'. Thus, contexts closely mentioning this book, the gallery, or Larry Gagosian are prioritized. 2. Relevance to the claim: The aim is to determine who founded the publisher of "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible." Contexts supplying information about Gagosian Gallery or Larry Gagosian are most relevant. 3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts discussing the gallery's history, founder, or publishing details directly address the claim and are ranked higher.

idx: [8, 3, 0, 4, 1, 2, 6, 7]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 8: This context explicitly mentions "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible" and its publisher, Gagosian Gallery. It directly matches the first reasoning step and is highly relevant to the claim.
2. Context 3: This context provides information about Gagosian Gallery, including that it is owned and directed by Larry Gagosian. It matches the second reasoning step and is relevant to the claim.
3. Context 0: This context discusses a publication called "Testament of Youth," which could potentially be confused with "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible," but it is unrelated to the actual publisher or founder in the claim. It is less relevant than the first two contexts.
4. Context 4: This context mentions a title with "Holy Bible," but it is about an album unrelated to "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible" or Gagosian Gallery. Thus, it is not directly connected but may have some minimal geographical or thematic relevance due to the shared term.
5. Other contexts like 1, 2, 6, and 7 are about broader biblical translations or historical mentions of books that do not correspond to the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. They are not as informative or relevant to the claim.

# idx: [8, 3, 0, 4]

step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 8 mentions "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible" directly and identifies Gagosian Gallery as its publisher. This aligns closely with the first reasoning step ("The Final Testament of the Holy Bible >> publisher >>>> Gagosian Gallery") and is highly relevant to the claim. It is likely to contain part of the answer.
2. Context with idx 3 describes Gagosian Gallery and states it is owned and directed by Larry Gagosian, directly addressing the second reasoning step ("Gagosian Gallery >> founded by >>>> Larry Gagosian"). This context is crucial as it identifies the founder, directly supporting the claim.
3. Context with idx 0, while somewhat related through its similar-sounding title, does not mention "The Final Testament of the Holy Bible" or its publisher, nor does it support the reasoning steps. It is much less relevant and unlikely to contain the answer. However, other contexts like idx 4 are even less relevant, making this the third ranked.

Question:During which era was the company that makes Nirbhay founded?
golden idx: [6, 7]
step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps:
   - Entity 1: Nirbhay
   - Entity 2: Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
   - Relationship: Nirbhay is made by DRDO.
   - Entity 3: Era from "1950s to the 1970s"
   - Relationship: DRDO was founded during the "1950s to 1970s."
2. Assess the contexts with titles or paragraph texts that strongly match these entities and relationships.
3. Prioritize contexts explicitly discussing DRDO, its founding, Nirbhay, or the era "1950s to 1970s."
4. Evaluate the informativeness and likelihood of the context containing directly relevant information to the claim (when DRDO, the maker of Nirbhay, was founded).
5. Rank contexts based on the combined scores and select the top 16 most relevant.

idx: [6, 7, 3, 2, 1, 19, 16, 18, 9, 11, 8, 13, 17, 4, 15, 10]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will focus on the reasoning steps provided. Reasoning step 1 identifies the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as the entity that makes Nirbhay, so contexts related to Nirbhay and DRDO are most relevant. Reasoning step 2 focuses on the era during which DRDO was founded. Therefore, I will prioritize contexts that provide founding details about DRDO or that mention time periods relevant to the 1950s-1970s, as this aligns with the reasoning steps. I will also assess how likely the context may contain the answer to the claim. Matching entities (e.g., DRDO, Nirbhay) and relevance to founding timestamp will strongly influence the rankings.

# idx: [6, 7, 3, 2, 16, 19, 10, 4]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 6 ("Nirbhay"): This context directly mentions "Nirbhay" and provides information about its development by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It is highly relevant to the first reasoning step, which identifies DRDO as the organization responsible for Nirbhay. This context is likely to contain information related to the claim.
2. Context 7 ("Hyderabad"): This context mentions the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and provides a timeline for its establishment, specifically from the 1950s to the 1970s. This aligns with the second reasoning step, which seeks the era of DRDO's founding. It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context 3 ("Poggenpohl"): This context discusses the founding of a furniture company and is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. It does not mention DRDO or Nirbhay and is unlikely to contain relevant information.
4. Context 2 ("GEPetrol"): This context discusses the founding of an oil company in Equatorial Guinea, which is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. It does not mention DRDO or Nirbhay and is not relevant.
5. Context 16 ("Ella Spira"): This context discusses a composer and her work, which is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. It does not mention DRDO or Nirbhay and is not relevant.
6. Context 19 ("GeminiJets"): This context discusses a model airplane manufacturer and is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. It does not mention DRDO or Nirbhay and is not relevant.
7. Context 10 ("James Ware (ophthalmologist)"): This context discusses an English eye surgeon and is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. It does not mention DRDO or Nirbhay and is not relevant.
8. Context 4 ("Hale & Kilburn"): This context discusses a furniture manufacturing company and is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. It does not mention DRDO or Nirbhay and is not relevant.

# idx: [6, 7, 3, 2]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 6 ("Nirbhay") matches directly with the first reasoning step, as it mentions that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) designed and developed Nirbhay. This context provides direct information about the entity that makes Nirbhay, making it both highly relevant and likely to help address the claim.
2. Context idx 7 ("Hyderabad") provides relevant information for the second reasoning step. It mentions the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) being established between the 1950s and the 1970s, which aligns with the reasoning step asking when the DRDO was founded. This makes it highly pertinent to the claim.
3. Context idx 2 ("GEPetrol") is unrelated to the claim. It discusses an oil company in Equatorial Guinea and does not mention DRDO, Nirbhay, or anything relevant to the stated reasoning steps. It is neither relevant to the claim nor likely to contain the answer.
4. Context idx 3 ("Poggenpohl") similarly does not relate to the claim about DRDO or Nirbhay. It discusses a furniture brand and its history, which has no connection to the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.

1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps. The key entities are "Agni-V," "manufacturer," and "Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)". Additionally, the time period "from the 1950s to the 1970s" is important for determining the era of DRDO's founding.
2. Evaluate each context for its relevance to the entities and relationships. Contexts explicitly mentioning "Agni-V," "DRDO," or the 1950s-1970s time period are prioritized.
3. Assess how likely each context is to contain information answering the claim, particularly with respect to DRDO's founding era.
4. Combine relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to rank the contexts.
5. Select the top 16 ranked contexts based on total scores.

# idx: [15, 16, 9, 0, 6, 14, 5, 8, 7, 2, 4, 12, 3, 11, 1, 10]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will evaluate them based on the following criteria:  
1. **Match with entities/relationships in reasoning steps**: The entities in the reasoning steps include "Agni-V," "manufacturer," "Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)", and the time period "from the 1950s to the 1970s." Contexts matching these terms in their title or paragraph will rank higher.  
2. **Relevance to the claim**: The claim seeks to identify the era in which DRDO was founded. Contexts specifically explaining the foundation of DRDO and its history will rank above others.  
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts that present information directly answering this claim, such as describing DRDO's establishment time (1950s-1970s), or a context that provides chronological details about Indian enterprises, will score higher.  

Following this reasoning:   
- Context 15 explicitly mentions that DRDO developed Agni-V, linking both the missile and its manufacturer directly.  
- Context 16 provides details about DRDO, stating it was founded "from the 1950s to the 1970s," which matches the reasoning and likely contains the answer.  
- Context 9 refers to Agni-V in the context of its missile range and strategic importance but doesn't elaborate on DRDO's foundation era.  
- Other contexts like Context 0, which discusses Agni-I, and unrelated contexts (e.g., Context 5 on Agni Air Flight 101) are less relevant. 

Considering this evaluation:  
1. Context 15 aligns closely with Agni-V and DRDO.  
2. Context 16 explicitly provides the likely answer to the claim.  
3. Context 9 refers to Agni-V but is less focused on DRDO's founding era.  
4. Remaining contexts are progressively less relevant or unrelated.  

# idx: [16, 15, 9, 0, 5, 3, 4, 8]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 15 ("Agni-V"): This context directly mentions Agni-V and its manufacturer, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), highlighting their connection. This is highly relevant to the claim and reasoning steps, as the manufacturer is explicitly confirmed, and it strengthens the link for further investigation on DRDO's founding era.
2. Context 16 ("Hyderabad"): This context mentions the establishment of DRDO and several other enterprises, explicitly situating DRDO's founding in the time frame between the 1950s and the 1970s. It aligns with the reasoning step about DRDO's founding era, making it highly informative.
3. Context 9 ("India and weapons of mass destruction"): While not directly focusing on the founding of DRDO, it references Agni-V and its specifications under the larger context of India's weapon programs. It is somewhat relevant but less focused on the founding era of DRDO.
4. Context 0 ("Agni-I"): This mentions another missile developed by DRDO under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. Although it supports DRDO's involvement in missile development, it does not directly address the claim or focus on the founding of DRDO.

# idx: [15, 16, 9, 0]

step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 15 ("Agni-V") mentions the manufacturer of Agni-V as the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), which directly aligns with the reasoning step "Agni-V >> manufacturer >>>> Defence Research and Development Organisation." This context is highly relevant to the claim and likely contains part of the information needed to address the question.
2. Context idx 16 ("Hyderabad") clearly states that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was established between the 1950s and 1970s, directly addressing the reasoning step "During what era was Defence Research and Development Organisation founded? >>>> From the 1950s to the 1970s." This makes it highly relevant and likely to provide the answer to the claim.
3. Context idx 9 ("India and weapons of mass destruction") mentions the Agni-V missile but focuses more on India's nuclear weapons and missile development programs in general. While it provides some background, it is less specific to the reasoning steps or the founding era of DRDO compared to the top-ranked contexts.
4. Context idx 0 ("Agni-I") mentions DRDO as a missile developer but focuses on another missile (Agni-I) rather than Agni-V or DRDO’s founding era. Therefore, it is less relevant to the specific claim.

Question:In what era was the company known as the manufacturer of Agni-V founded?
golden idx: [2, 6]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Analyze the reasoning steps for key entities and relationships: "manufacturer of Agni-V" maps to "Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)" and "era when DRDO was founded" maps to "from the 1950s to the 1970s."
2. Search for contexts explicitly mentioning "Agni-V," "Defence Research and Development Organisation," and the era "1950s to 1970s."
3. Rank contexts based on how much they match these entities, relationships, and timeframes.
4. Prioritize contexts that directly reference DRDO, its founding timeline, or its role as the manufacturer of Agni-V. Additionally, consider the broader context of the Indian defense industry during the specified era.
5. Between contexts, weigh specificity, relevance, and likelihood that the context contains information answering the claim.
6. Compile the top 16 ranked contexts according to the scoring criteria.

# idx: [2, 6, 8, 18, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 14, 13, 11, 16, 15]

# step-by-step think: The reasoning steps require identifying the company responsible for the manufacturing of Agni-V, which is identified as the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), and then determining the era of DRDO's founding. The most relevant contexts will include direct mentions of Agni-V, DRDO, or their history, with additional importance given to contexts mentioning the era of DRDO's establishment. Contexts that are unrelated to DRDO, Agni-V, or their founding era will be deprioritized. An assessment of relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the needed information determines the ranking.

# 1. Context 2 contains detailed information on Agni-V and explicitly identifies it as developed by DRDO, directly addressing the first step of the reasoning process and partially relevant to the claim.
# 2. Context 6 discusses DRDO's founding (from the 1950s to the 1970s), directly addressing the second reasoning step and the core of the claim.
# 3. Context 8 briefly mentions Agni-V, but does not provide specific details about DRDO or its founding era, making it marginally relevant.
# 4. Context 18 discusses Agni Air, which is unrelated to Agni-V or DRDO. It is irrelevant to the question.
# 5. Context 0, Context 3, Context 1, Context 4, Context 7, Context 5, Context 9, Context 14, Context 13, Context 11, Context 16, Context 15 are entirely unrelated to DRDO, Agni-V, or their history as they focus on other companies unrelated to the claim. Therefore, they are deprioritized.

# Given these considerations:
idx: [6, 2, 8, 18, 3, 4, 5, 7]

step-by-step think: 
1. Context 2 ("Agni-V") directly identifies the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as the manufacturer of Agni-V, which directly matches the first reasoning step. It is extremely relevant and highly likely to contain the required piece of information related to the claim.
2. Context 6 ("Hyderabad") mentions the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in the context of the 1950s to 1970s, which aligns directly with the second reasoning step exploring the founding era of DRDO. This makes it very relevant to the claim and the reasoning steps.
3. Context 8 ("India and weapons of mass destruction") focuses on weapons systems including Agni-V, providing some context about India’s weaponry but does not directly provide information about the company or the era. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the specific answer compared to Context 2 and Context 6.
4. Context 18 ("Agni Air Flight 101") discusses an unrelated topic about Agni Air and does not align with the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. It is not relevant to addressing the claim, but is considered last due to its tangential mention of "Agni."

idx: [2, 6, 8, 18]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 2 ("Agni-V") provides direct information about the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), which is the manufacturer of the Agni-V missile, thus aligning with the first reasoning step. However, it does not provide specific information about when DRDO was founded to aid in answering the claim.
2. Context 6 ("Hyderabad") explicitly mentions that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was established from the 1950s to the 1970s, directly addressing both reasoning steps and the claim. This makes it the most relevant and likely to contain the answer.
3. Context 8 ("India and weapons of mass destruction") focuses on India's nuclear program and the Agni-V missile's specifications. While it mentions Agni-V, it does not provide information about DRDO's foundation era, thus having lower relevance to the claim.
4. Context 18 ("Agni Air Flight 101") is unrelated to the claim and reasoning steps, as it discusses a flight crash involving Agni Air rather than DRDO or its founding era.

Question:What city is located in the county containing Qiantong?
golden idx: [10, 13]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: Qiantong, Ninghai County, Ningbo, administrative territorial entity.
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.
3. Check for direct mentions of "Qiantong," "Ninghai County," or "Ningbo," and prioritize contexts that establish the administrative hierarchy or directly reference the entities.
4. Calculate the informativeness score based on how well the context provides information that answers the claim regarding the city located in the county containing Qiantong.
5. Calculate the likelihood score based on how likely the context may contain the answer.
6. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to rank the contexts, selecting the top 16 as the most relevant.

idx: [10, 13, 0, 1, 3, 19, 8, 17, 14, 15, 16, 9, 6, 5, 18, 2]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I based my evaluation on the following criteria: First, the match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps was assessed. The reasoning steps mentioned Qiantong being located in Ninghai County and Ninghai County being part of Ningbo. Therefore, contexts addressing Qiantong, Ninghai County, or Ningbo were considered highly relevant. Secondly, I assessed the overall relevance of the context to the claim about identifying the city located in the county containing Qiantong. Finally, I considered which contexts were more likely to contain the answer based on the inclusion of these specific entities within their content.
idx: [10, 13, 0, 19, 9, 14, 17, 1]

# step-by-step think: 

1. **Context 10 ("Qiantong, Zhejiang")** is highly relevant as it mentions Qiantong and situates it within Ninghai County in Zhejiang Province. This information directly relates to the reasoning step that connects Qiantong to Ninghai County. It may provide critical information for addressing the claim.

2. **Context 13 ("Hu Sanxing")** mentions Ninghai County and its association with Ningbo (as it refers to "current Ninghai County of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province"). This directly supports the reasoning step connecting Ninghai County to Ningbo and is essential for addressing the claim.

3. **Context 19 ("Saulkrasti Municipality")** is unrelated to the reasoning steps or the claim, as it discusses a municipality in Latvia rather than anything involving Qiantong or Ningbo. It is not prioritized.

4. **Context 0 ("Minsk Region")** mentions regions of Belarus and is unrelated to the entities or reasoning steps pertinent to the claim. It is excluded from the top-ranked contexts.

5. **Context 9 ("Australia")** discusses the political and administrative divisions in Australia, which are irrelevant to the reasoning steps related to China or the claim. It is not considered relevant.

6. **Context 14 ("Taputapuatea")** focuses on French Polynesia and is irrelevant to the claim about Qiantong, Ninghai County, and Ningbo.

7. **Context 17 ("Kiri Territory")** pertains to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is unrelated to the entities or reasoning steps for the given claim.

8. **Context 1 ("Federalism")** discusses federalism broadly and does not mention any entities relevant to Qiantong, Ninghai County, or Ningbo.

Given the analysis, the contexts containing the richest and most relevant information are ranked first.

# idx: [10, 13, 9, 1]

# step-by-step think:
1. The context with idx 10 ("Qiantong, Zhejiang"): This context directly addresses the location of Qiantong, explains its position within Ninghai County in Zhejiang province, and contains detailed and relevant geographic information. Its strong alignment with the reasoning steps makes it highly likely to contain the answer.
2. The context with idx 13 ("Hu Sanxing"): This context mentions Ninghai and clarifies it as part of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, thus supporting the reasoning steps by connecting Ninghai County to Ningbo. It provides relevant historical references but is less directly focused on Qiantong compared to idx 10.
3. The remaining contexts (idx 9 and idx 1): These contexts provide general or unrelated information about administrative structures (Australia and Federalism, respectively). They do not mention Qiantong, Ninghai County, or Ningbo, making them unlikely to contain the answer to the claim.

Question:What is the performer of Heartbeat named after?
golden idx: [4, 12]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Heartbeat," "performer," "Nina Sky," and "What Nina Sky is named after, specifically Natalie Albino."
2. Evaluate the context titles and paragraph texts for matches with these entities and relationships.
3. Assess which contexts are most likely to contain information directly relevant to the claim (e.g., contexts discussing Heartbeat, Nina Sky, Nicole and Natalie Albino, or their naming origins).
4. Assign higher scores to contexts that closely match the claim and reasoning steps and are more likely to answer the claim.
5. Rank and select the top 16 contexts based on relevance, informativeness, and proximity to the claim.

# idx: [4, 12, 6, 17, 0, 10, 15, 14, 1, 7, 9, 11, 3, 16, 2, 19]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate them based on three criteria: 1) How well the context matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: I will prioritize contexts that mention "Heartbeat", "Nina Sky", and "Natalie Albino" as these are directly involved in the reasoning steps. 2) Relevance to the claim: The contexts should provide information about the song "Heartbeat" or the performer "Nina Sky" and what they are named after. 3) Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that explain what Nina Sky is named after or origin details for Natalie Albino will be prioritized. I will carefully analyze and rank accordingly.
# idx: [12, 4, 6, 17, 10, 7, 9, 15]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 12 ("Nina Sky"): This context directly mentions Nina Sky and provides detailed information about the duo, including their names (Nicole and Natalie Albino). It aligns closely with the reasoning step, "What is Nina Sky named after? >>>> Natalie Albino," and is highly relevant to the claim, potentially containing part of the answer. 
2. Context 4 ("Heartbeat (Nina Sky song)"): This context specifically relates to the song "Heartbeat" by Nina Sky, which matches the reasoning step "Heartbeat >> performer >>>> Nina Sky." It is highly relevant and likely informative about the claim.
3. Context 6 ("Fischerspooner"): This context discusses how the group Fischerspooner was named after its founders. It provides an example of performers named after individuals, but it does not directly involve Nina Sky or Heartbeat. It is somewhat related but less likely to contain the specific answer to the claim.
4. Context 7 ("Heartbeat in the Brain"): This context is unrelated to Nina Sky or the song "Heartbeat” but discusses a documentary film. It does not align with the reasoning steps or claim and is not likely to contain the answer.

# idx: [12, 4, 6, 7]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 12 (title: "Nina Sky"): This mentions the performer "Nina Sky" and provides background information about the duo, including the names of the members Nicole and Natalie Albino. This is directly aligned with the reasoning steps ("Heartbeat >> performer >>>> Nina Sky" and "What is Nina Sky named after? >>>> Natalie Albino") and is highly relevant to the claim because it is likely to contain information about what "Nina Sky" is named after.
2. Context with idx 4 (title: "Heartbeat (Nina Sky song)"): This discusses the song "Heartbeat" by Nina Sky. While it confirms the performer of "Heartbeat," it focuses more on the song's release details and less on the origin of the name "Nina Sky," making it slightly less relevant than idx 12.
3. Context with idx 6 (title: "Fischerspooner"): This mentions another duo and their naming origin, but it does not relate to "Nina Sky" or the song "Heartbeat," so it is not directly relevant.
4. Context with idx 7 (title: "Heartbeat in the Brain"): This discusses a completely unrelated topic and is irrelevant to the claim.

Question:The Move Ya Body song's band is named after who?
golden idx: [7, 9]
# step-by-step think:
1. Break down the reasoning steps, which include the entities and relationships: 
   - "Move Ya Body" is performed by Nina Sky.
   - Nina Sky is named after Natalie Albino.
2. Match these entities and relationships with the contexts. Focus on documents related to "Move Ya Body," "Nina Sky," and connections related to Natalie Albino.
3. Assign relevance scores by evaluating how closely the context title or paragraph_text aligns with the reasoning steps and the claim.
4. Consider the informativeness of the context concerning the claim. The more directly it provides information about the song "Move Ya Body," Nina Sky, or the origin of the band's name, the higher the score.
5. Assess the likelihood of the context containing the answer based on the content's clarity, direct mention of key entities, and relevance to Nina Sky's naming.
6. Rank the contexts by combining scores for relevance, informativeness, and likelihood and select the 16 most relevant ones.

# idx: 
1. Context 9 ("Nina Sky") explicitly mentions the band Nina Sky and identifies the twin members, Nicole and Natalie Albino, which aligns closely with the reasoning steps.
2. Context 7 ("Move Ya Body") directly addresses the song "Move Ya Body" by Nina Sky, relevant to the claim and reasoning steps.
3. Context 6 ("Hoji Fortuna") involves naming conventions and their origins but is less directly tied to Nina Sky.
4. Context 19 ("San Andreas Fault") mentions naming origins but is unrelated to the claim.
5. Context 2 ("Pontiac Bonneville Special") involves naming inspirations but does not connect to Nina Sky.
6. Context 8 ("Mitzi Meyerson") describes musical origins but does not discuss Nina Sky.
7. Context 1 ("Nevels Corners") also involves naming but is unrelated to the claim.
8. Context 5 ("Harrysong") discusses an artist's name origins but is not tied to Nina Sky.
9. Context 4 ("Chen Peisi") discusses naming origins but is unrelated to the reasoning steps.
10. Context 3 ("Saida Miller Khalifa") presents a naming story unrelated to Nina Sky.
11. Context 11 ("Body Pressure") contains the phrase "body" but is irrelevant to "Move Ya Body."
12. Context 16 ("Shake Ya Ass") discusses another song but is unrelated to "Move Ya Body."
13. Context 17 ("The Incredible Sound Machine") involves music but lacks relevance to Nina Sky.
14. Context 13 ("Bison antiquus") is unrelated to the reasoning steps or entities mentioned.
15. Context 0 ("Moonwalk (dance)") and 12 ("Maiysha") are unrelated to the claim.
16. Context 18 ("Intuition Peak") has no relation to the entities or reasoning steps.

idx: [9, 7, 6, 19, 2, 8, 1, 5, 4, 3, 11, 16, 17, 13, 0, 18]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts effectively:
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps provide two key entities - "Move Ya Body" and "Nina Sky," and link Nina Sky to "Natalie Albino" (since Nina Sky is named after Natalie Albino). Contexts that mention these entities or their relationships will rank higher. 
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts that deeply associate with the band "Nina Sky," its origins, or the song "Move Ya Body" would be most relevant.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that discuss the origin of the name "Nina Sky" or mention "Natalie Albino" comprehensively have a higher likelihood of containing the answer.

Ranking:
- Context 9 explicitly mentions Nina Sky as a duo of twins, Nicole and Natalie Albino, and their song "Move Ya Body," providing essential context linking to the reasoning steps.
- Context 7 focuses on the song "Move Ya Body" and its performer Nina Sky, directly relevant to the claim.
- Context 4 discusses naming after a different individual's influence, which is somewhat tangential but touches on naming origins.
- Context 6 and others like Context 5 are not directly relevant to the entities or the reason steps provided, so they rank lower due to weaker alignment.

# idx: [9, 7, 4, 6, 2, 5, 1, 0]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 9 ("Nina Sky"): This directly mentions "Nina Sky" as a female duo and names its members, Nicole and Natalie Albino. It also mentions that their debut single was "Move Ya Body," which establishes the link to the reasoning step "Move Ya Body >> performer >>> Nina Sky." Additionally, it explicitly states that the duo's name relates to Natalie Albino, making it highly relevant to the claim and the reasoning steps. This context is likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 7 ("Move Ya Body"): This mentions "Move Ya Body" and "Nina Sky." While it provides less detail about the origins of Nina Sky's name, it is relevant to the first reasoning step "Move Ya Body >> performer >>> Nina Sky." However, it does not fully explain what Nina Sky is named after, making it slightly less relevant compared to Context 9.
3. Context 6 ("Hoji Fortuna"): This context discusses a person named after someone else (Hoji-ya-Henda). While it mentions a naming origin, it is unrelated to the entities "Nina Sky" or "Move Ya Body." It is less likely to contain information directly relevant to the claim.
4. Context 5 ("Harrysong"): This mentions the stage name of Harrysong, a music artist, and its origins. While somewhat related to naming, it is unrelated to Nina Sky or Move Ya Body, making it less relevant to the claim.

# idx: [9, 7, 6, 5]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 9 ("Nina Sky") is highly relevant to the reasoning steps as it directly mentions the artist Nina Sky, their song "Move Ya Body," and that the duo is composed of Nicole and Natalie Albino (relevant to the question’s focus on the name source). This context not only aligns well with the entities but is also highly likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 7 ("Move Ya Body") is also directly relevant as it discusses the song "Move Ya Body" and its performer Nina Sky. This provides supporting information but does not focus specifically on the naming origins of the band as much as Context 9. Therefore, it ranks slightly lower.
3. Context 6 ("Hoji Fortuna") is less aligned with the reasoning steps. While it mentions naming origins (albeit for a different person), it does not relate to Nina Sky or "Move Ya Body," making it much less relevant to the claim than the previous two contexts.

Question:When did the spacecraft that detected storms on Neptune leave our solar system?
golden idx: [8, 10]
step-by-step think:  
1. Analyze the claim and identify the main entities and points: The claim revolves around "the spacecraft that detected storms on Neptune (Voyager 2)" and its departure from the solar system.  
2. Reasoning steps highlight two aspects:  
    - Voyager 2 detected storms on Neptune  
    - Identifying when Voyager 2 left our solar system (August 30, 2007).  
3. Evaluate contexts for relevance to Voyager 2, its encounters with Neptune, and its exit from the solar system.  
4. Prioritize contexts directly addressing Voyager 2, its observations (like storms on Neptune), and significant milestones, like leaving the solar system.  
5. Score contexts on the likelihood of containing the needed information and their relevance to the reasoning steps.  
6. Rank the contexts accordingly.  

idx: [2, 10, 19, 8, 12, 1, 6, 14, 5, 7, 0, 4, 3, 11, 13, 15]

# step-by-step think:
To rank the contexts, I'll evaluate them based on these criteria:
1. **Match with Reasoning Steps**: The reasoning steps mention "Voyager 2" as the spacecraft that detected storms on Neptune and its departure from the solar system on August 30, 2007. Contexts focusing on Voyager 2 and its journey beyond the solar system will score the highest.
2. **Relevance to the Claim**: The claim asks when the spacecraft that detected Neptune's storms left the solar system. Contexts discussing Voyager 2's detection of Neptune's storms and its milestones in leaving the solar system are highly relevant.
3. **Informativeness and Likelihood of Containing the Answer**: Contexts that provide specific dates, milestones, or explanations of Voyager 2's journey or exploration of Neptune are likely to contain the answer to the claim.

### Evaluation of Contexts:
- **Context 10** ("Voyager 2"): Directly mentions Voyager 2 passing the termination shock on August 30, 2007, and its entry into the heliosheath. This is crucial information answering the claim. High match with reasoning step 2.
- **Context 2** ("Voyager 2"): Discusses Voyager 2's approach to Neptune in 1989 and its discoveries related to storms (e.g., the Great Dark Spot). High relevance to reasoning step 1.
- **Context 19** ("Exploration of Neptune"): Highlights Voyager 2 as the only spacecraft to explore Neptune, though it doesn't detail its departure from the solar system. Partially relevant.
- **Context 8** ("Neptune"): Refers to storms discovered by Voyager 2 on Neptune, such as the Great Dark Spot. Relevant to reasoning step 1 but lacks detail on its departure.
- **Context 12** ("Neptune"): Mentions Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune in 1989, though not specific to storms or its exit from the solar system. Moderately relevant to reasoning step 1.
- **Context 1** ("Neptune"): Provides general information about Neptune but no direct mention of Voyager 2 or its departure. Low relevance.
- **Context 6** ("Neptune"): A general discussion of weather and atmospheric heating on Neptune. Minimal connection to the reasoning steps.
- **Context 14** ("Neptune"): Discusses Neptune's orbit but is unrelated to Voyager 2 or the claim. Not relevant.

### Final Decision for Top 8 Contexts:
1. **Context 10**: Clear match with reasoning step 2 (leaving solar system).
2. **Context 2**: Strong match with reasoning step 1 (detecting storms).
3. **Context 8**: Discusses storms on Neptune observed by Voyager 2.
4. **Context 19**: Highlights Voyager 2's role in exploring Neptune.
5. **Context 12**: Mentions Voyager 2's Neptune flyby but lacks detail.
6. **Context 1**: Provides context on Neptune but no specifics on Voyager 2.
7. **Context 6**: Discusses weather on Neptune, tangentially related.
8. **Context 14**: Marginal relevance due to its focus on Neptune.

# idx: [10, 2, 8, 19, 12, 1, 6, 14]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context {"idx": 10, "title": "Voyager 2"}: This context provides the specific date (August 30, 2007) on which Voyager 2 passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, associated with it leaving the Solar System. It directly aligns with the reasoning step about when Voyager 2 left the Solar System, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context {"idx": 2, "title": "Voyager 2"}: This context details Voyager 2’s discovery of the Great Dark Spot and other features during its 1989 encounter with Neptune. It also establishes Voyager 2 as the spacecraft detecting storms on Neptune, directly addressing the first reasoning step. Highly relevant to the claim.
3. Context {"idx": 19, "title": "Exploration of Neptune"}: This context ties Voyager 2 to the exploration of Neptune as the only spacecraft that visited it in 1989. Although it does not directly answer when Voyager 2 left the Solar System, it reinforces the link to Neptune’s storms and is relevant to the reasoning steps.
4. Context {"idx": 8, "title": "Neptune"}: This context describes the detection of storms like the Small Dark Spot and references Voyager 2’s role during its encounter with Neptune, aligning partially with the reasoning steps regarding storms on Neptune.

# idx: [10, 2, 19, 8]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 10 ("Voyager 2"): This context directly addresses Voyager 2 and provides specific information about when Voyager 2 passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, which is directly relevant to the second reasoning step about when Voyager 2 left the solar system. It is highly likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 19 ("Exploration of Neptune"): Although it mentions Voyager 2 as the spacecraft that explored Neptune, it provides a broader summary of Neptune exploration rather than focusing on when Voyager 2 left the solar system. It is less specific compared to context 10 but still relevant to the claim and reasoning steps.
3. Context 2 ("Voyager 2"): This context extensively discusses Voyager 2's Neptune encounter and details the findings made during the flyby, including the detection of the Great Dark Spot. While informative about Neptune and the storms, it is less relevant to the specific question of when Voyager 2 left the solar system, which reduces its score compared to context 10.

Question:The Nicole and Natalie album's band is named after who?
golden idx: [5, 19]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships from the reasoning steps: "Nicole and Natalie >> performer >>> Nina Sky", and "What is Nina Sky named after? >>> Natalie Albino".
2. Search the contexts for mentions of "Nicole and Natalie", "Nina Sky", and "Natalie Albino".
3. Determine which contexts are directly relevant to the claim by examining how well they match the reasoning steps and the claim itself.
4. Evaluate how well each context is likely to provide the answer to the claim based on the reasoning steps and the specificity of the information provided.
5. Rank the contexts according to their relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer, while selecting the top 16 contexts.

# idx: [5, 19, 17, 3, 6, 18, 2, 15, 7, 1, 8, 4, 14, 13, 0, 9]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will consider the following criteria: 1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention the "Nicole and Natalie album," which involves the performers Nina Sky, as well as the fact that Nina Sky is named after "Natalie Albino." Contexts directly related to Nina Sky, the "Nicole and Natalie" album, or the naming of Nina Sky will be scored highly. 2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts discussing "Nina Sky" or their naming directly relate to the claim about the band's name. 3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts explaining details about Nina Sky's name and their connection to the album Nicole and Natalie are most likely to answer the claim.
# Contexts such as idx 5 and 19 explicitly discuss Nina Sky, their album, and their background. Other contexts mentioning actresses named Natalie or unrelated topics are less relevant.
idx: [5, 19, 3, 17, 9, 7, 4, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context (idx: 5, title: "Nina Sky") directly mentions "Nicole and Natalie" as the second studio album of Nina Sky and provides information that Nina Sky is composed of identical twins Nicole and Natalie Albino. Additionally, it connects to the reasoning steps mentioning that Nina Sky is related to Nicole and Natalie. This context is highly relevant to the claim and likely to contain the answer.  
2. Context (idx: 19, title: "Nicole and Natalie") specifically discusses the album Nicole and Natalie by Nina Sky, describing its release and related songs. This context ties directly to the claim and reasoning steps, particularly focusing on the album and its creator, Nina Sky. It is likely to contain relevant information.  
3. Context (idx: 6, title: "Padmé Amidala"): Although this context features someone named Natalie, it pertains to Natalie Portman, which is unrelated to the claim. The reasoning steps focus on Nicole and Natalie Albino of Nina Sky and their relationship, so this context is not relevant.  
4. Context (idx: 3, title: "After Sundown (2006 film)") provides no connection to Nicole or Natalie Albino or Nina Sky, which makes it irrelevant to the question at hand. The reasoning steps do not link to this film or its cast.  
5. Contexts with titles such as "Skin Wars," "Santa Clarita Diet," or "Rabbit Hole (film)" have either minimal or no connection to the entities in the reasoning steps nor the claim. They do not offer information about Nina Sky or the album. Therefore, they rank low.  

# idx: [5, 19, 3, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 5 ("Nina Sky"): This context directly addresses the reasoning steps by identifying Nina Sky as an American female duo composed of identical twins Nicole and Natalie Albino. It further provides context about their albums, including "Nicole & Natalie," linking it to the claim. The mention of "Nicole and Natalie" and its direct relationship with "Nina Sky" makes it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 19 ("Nicole and Natalie"): This context directly focuses on the second studio album "Nicole and Natalie" by the duo Nina Sky. It elaborates on the album's details and mentions the band itself. While it provides relevant information, it's less explicit in linking Nina Sky's name origin to Natalie Albino compared to Context 5.
3. Context 3 ("After Sundown (2006 film)"): This context is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. It does not mention "Nicole and Natalie" or "Nina Sky," nor does it address the band or their albums.
4. Context 6 ("Padmé Amidala"): This context discusses Natalie Portman and her role in "Star Wars," which is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. It does not mention "Nicole and Natalie," "Nina Sky," or anything related to the band.

Question:Where was the founder of the National Women's Party born?
golden idx: [4, 11]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Alice Paul", "National Women's Party", and "place of birth >>> Mount Laurel Township".
2. Search for the contexts that mention Alice Paul, Mount Laurel Township, or provide any information relating to her connections, particularly her place of birth or association with the National Women's Party.
3. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the presence of these entities or relationships in either the title or the paragraph_text.
4. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on the depth of detail it provides on Alice Paul's birthplace or association with Mount Laurel Township.
5. Calculate the likelihood score for each context based on how directly it answers the claim about Alice Paul's place of birth.
6. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to get the final score for each context.
7. Rank the contexts based on the final scores and select the top 16 ranked contexts.

idx: [4, 11, 15, 19, 14, 3, 6, 1, 7, 8, 12, 2, 17, 18, 9, 10]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the following criteria: 1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps specify "Alice Paul", "place of birth", and "Mount Laurel Township". Contexts that explicitly mention these entities or relationships are prioritized. 2. Relevance to the claim: The claim is about the birthplace of Alice Paul, so contexts that discuss Alice Paul's birthplace will be scored higher. 3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that explicitly provide the birthplace of Alice Paul or are directly connected to this information will score the highest. 

Analyzing the contexts: 
- Context 4 mentions that Paulsdale in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey, is the birthplace of Alice Paul, making it extremely relevant.
- Context 11 discusses Alice Paul's involvement with the National Women's Party but does not mention her birthplace.
- Context 15 talks about Alice Paul's role in organizing the Silent Sentinels but does not address her birthplace.
- The remaining contexts (e.g., Contexts 19, 14, 3, 6, 1) do not mention Alice Paul or her birthplace, and therefore are less relevant.

# idx: [4, 11, 15, 19, 14, 3, 6, 1]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 4 ("Paulsdale") is highly relevant to the reasoning steps as it mentions "Paulsdale, in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey," which is identified as the birthplace of Alice Paul. This directly aligns with the reasoning step about Alice Paul's place of birth. It is very likely to contain the answer to the claim.

2. Context with idx 11 ("National Woman's Party") mentions Alice Paul and her leadership in the National Woman’s Party. This is relevant to the reasoning step identifying Alice Paul as the founder of the National Women's Party. However, it does not address her birthplace, making it less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to idx 4.

3. Context with idx 15 ("Silent Sentinels") also discusses Alice Paul and activities related to the National Woman's Party, particularly protests for suffrage. While related to Alice Paul's historical activities, it does not pertain to her birthplace. Thus, it is relevant but less directly useful for answering the claim.

4. Context with idx 19 ("Mary Birdsall") provides historical information about a different suffragist and does not pertain to Alice Paul or Mount Laurel Township. It is less relevant to both the reasoning steps and the claim.

Remaining contexts, such as idx 1 (focused on opposition to suffrage) and idx 6 (about International Women’s Day), are unrelated to Alice Paul or her birthplace. They do not directly support the reasoning steps or the claim.

# idx: [4, 11, 15, 19]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 4 ("Paulsdale") is highly relevant as it directly mentions "Paulsdale, in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey," as the birthplace of Alice Paul, who is identified in the reasoning steps as the founder of the National Women's Party. This context explicitly answers the claim and is the most likely to contain the answer. 
2. Context 11 ("National Woman's Party") mentions Alice Paul and her leadership in the National Woman's Party but does not provide information about her birthplace. While it is relevant to Alice Paul, it is less likely to contain the answer to the claim compared to Context 4.
3. Context 15 ("Silent Sentinels") discusses Alice Paul's role in organizing protests for women's suffrage but does not mention her birthplace. It is somewhat relevant but less likely to contain the answer compared to Contexts 4 and 11.
4. Context 19 ("Mary Birdsall") is unrelated to Alice Paul or her birthplace. It discusses a different suffragist and is not relevant to the claim.

Question:What is the place of birth of the person who submitted the first version of the equal rights amendment to congress in 1923?
golden idx: [0, 18]
step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "who submitted the first version of the equal rights amendment to congress in 1923" → Alice Paul; "Alice Paul" → place of birth → Mount Laurel Township.
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context:
   - Contexts discussing Alice Paul or her contributions, especially her connection to the Equal Rights Amendment, are highly relevant.
   - Contexts directly mentioning Mount Laurel Township (or Paulsdale, her birthplace in Mount Laurel) are highly relevant.
3. Calculate the informativeness score:
   - Contexts specifically detailing Alice Paul's role in the Equal Rights Amendment or her birthplace are scored higher.
4. Assess the likelihood of containing the answer:
   - Contexts explicitly mentioning Alice Paul's birth or providing background about her life are likely to contain the answer.
5. Combine relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to rank the contexts.
6. Select the top 16 ranked contexts.

idx: [18, 0, 1, 18, 3, 5, 6, 19, 12, 9, 10, 14, 13, 17, 8, 15]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will evaluate how well they align with the reasoning steps and the claim. The reasoning steps focus on Alice Paul, who submitted the first version of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923, and her place of birth, which is identified as Mount Laurel Township. The most relevant contexts would provide information either about Alice Paul’s contributions or directly about her birthplace. Contexts mentioning Mount Laurel Township or Alice Paul would be ranked higher, particularly if they describe her place of birth or provide historical details about her work. Irrelevant contexts that discuss unrelated amendments or unrelated constitutional content will be ranked lower.
# idx: [18, 0, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 18 ("Paulsdale"): This context directly mentions Mount Laurel Township as the birthplace of Alice Paul, who is identified in the reasoning steps as the person who submitted the first version of the Equal Rights Amendment to Congress in 1923. It is highly relevant, informative, and likely contains the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 0 ("Equal Rights Amendment"): This context mentions Alice Paul and her role in revising the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923. While it does not address her place of birth, it is relevant to the claim and reasoning steps as it confirms her involvement with the amendment.
3. Context 5 ("Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"): This context provides background on constitutional amendments but does not directly address Alice Paul or her place of birth. It is less relevant than the first two contexts but still provides some historical context.
4. Context 6 ("History of the United States Constitution"): This context discusses the process of constitutional ratification but does not mention Alice Paul, the Equal Rights Amendment, or her place of birth. It is less relevant but provides general background on constitutional amendments.

# idx: [18, 0, 5, 6]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context idx 18 ("Paulsdale"): This context directly mentions that "Paulsdale, in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey, was the birthplace and childhood home of Alice Paul." It matches the reasoning step identifying "Alice Paul's place of birth >>> Mount Laurel Township" and is closely related to the claim. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context idx 0 ("Equal Rights Amendment"): This context discusses Alice Paul in relation to her role in revising the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923. While it provides relevant background about her involvement, it does not directly address her place of birth, making it secondary in relevance.
3. Context idx 5 ("Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"): This context focuses on the history of the Nineteenth Amendment, unrelated to Alice Paul's place of birth or the Equal Rights Amendment from 1923. It is unlikely to contain the answer and is ranked lower.
4. Context idx 6 ("History of the United States Constitution"): This context discusses the drafting and ratification of the U.S. Constitution but has no relation to the Equal Rights Amendment, Alice Paul, or her place of birth, making it the least relevant.

Question:The Directory of Public Worship was approved by a parliament whose modern equivalent has been based where since 2004?
golden idx: [13, 16]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: Scottish Parliament, approved the Directory of Public Worship teachings (historical context), modern equivalent, and its location since 2004—Scottish Parliament Building.
2. Examine the contexts, prioritizing explicitly relevant entries containing "Scottish Parliament," "Directory of Public Worship," and "Scottish Parliament Building."
3. "Scottish Parliament" is a key entity in the reasoning steps, and contexts discussing its location since 2004 (Scottish Parliament Building) or the connection to the Directory of Public Worship (Scottish Parliament enacting laws) are highly likely to address the claim.
4. Rank contexts based on how closely they align with the main entities and relationships in the reasoning steps, followed by relevance and informativeness.
5. Select the top 16 contexts based on their relevance to addressing the claim.

# idx: [13, 16, 0, 6, 12, 14, 5, 9, 8, 18, 1, 10, 19, 7, 11, 17]

# step-by-step think: 
In order to rank the contexts, I followed the given rules: 

1. **Match with Reasoning Steps**:  
   The reasoning steps include two critical entities and relationships:
   - The Directory of Public Worship was enacted into law by the Scottish Parliament.
   - The official home of the Scottish Parliament since 2004 has been the Scottish Parliament Building in Holyrood, Edinburgh. 
   Contexts referencing either the Scottish Parliament or the Directory of Public Worship receive higher ranks.

2. **Relevance to the Claim**:  
   The claim asks about the Parliament that based its modern equivalent in 2004. This necessitates contexts mentioning the Scottish Parliament and its modern building from 2004 onward.

3. **Likelihood of Containing the Answer**:  
   Contexts directly describing the Scottish Parliament Building, its location, or referencing its history are more likely to contain the answer.

Based on this:
- Context 13 directly identifies the official home of the Scottish Parliament since 2004 as the new Scottish Parliament Building in Holyrood, Edinburgh. This context explicitly matches the reasoning step asking where the Scottish Parliament has been based since 2004.
- Context 16 explains the enactment of the Directory of Public Worship into law by the Scottish Parliament, fulfilling the historical aspect and making it directly relevant to the earlier entity in the reasoning steps.
- Other contexts lack relevance or do not contain sufficient detail about either the Scottish Parliament or its modern equivalent.

# Rankings
1. **Context 13**: Title and content explicitly discuss the Scottish Parliament's official location since 2004, making it the most directly relevant.  
2. **Context 16**: Discusses the enactment of the Directory of Public Worship by the Scottish Parliament, matching one reasoning step of importance.  
3. **Context 6**: Although less relevant, its mention of a governmental body with a similar title (Directory) can cause confusion; however, it is tangential to the claim.  
4. **Context 0**: Describes lawmaking but unrelated to the Scottish Parliament or Directory of Public Worship.  
5. **Context 12**: Discusses federal law expansion, not related to Scotland or the specified topic.  
6. **Context 14**: Covers unrelated U.S. legislation and has no relevance.  
7. **Context 19**: Discusses a township, irrelevant to the claim's focus on Scottish governance.  
8. **Context 17**: Focuses on the Philippines, unrelated to the claim.

# idx: [13, 16, 6, 0, 12, 14, 19, 17]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 13 ("Scottish Parliament"): It directly mentions the official home of the Scottish Parliament since 2004, which is the focus of the claim's second reasoning step. It is highly relevant and likely contains the answer about the location of the modern equivalent of the parliament.
2. Context 16 ("Presbyterianism"): This context refers to the enactment of the Directory of Public Worship by the Scottish Parliament, matching the first reasoning step. While it does not directly answer the claim about the parliament's location since 2004, it is still relevant due to its connection to the historical basis of the claim.
3. Context 6 ("French Directory"): This context discusses a "Directory," but it is unrelated to the Scottish Parliament or the Directory of Public Worship from the claim. It is not relevant and unlikely to contain the answer.
4. Context 12 ("Law of the United States"), Context 14 ("Federal Assault Weapons Ban"), Context 19 ("Plymouth Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania"), and Context 17 ("Sipag Pinoy") are all unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps. They do not mention the Scottish Parliament or the Directory of Public Worship and are not relevant to answering the claim.

Based on these analyses:
- Context 13 is the top choice for directly addressing the claim's focus on the location of the Scottish Parliament since 2004.
- Context 16 provides essential background related to the first reasoning step.
- Other contexts are significantly less relevant. 

# idx: [13, 16, 6, 0]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 13 ("Scottish Parliament"): This context directly addresses the reasoning step "Where has the official home of Scottish Parliament been since 2004?" It clearly states that the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh since September 2004. It is highly relevant and very likely contains the answer to the claim. 
2. Context 16 ("Presbyterianism"): This context touches upon the entity "Directory of Public Worship" and explains that it was enacted by the Scottish Parliament, matching another reasoning step. However, it does not directly address the claim about the Scottish Parliament's location since 2004.
3. Context 6 ("French Directory"): This context discusses the French Directory, which is unrelated to the claim and reasoning steps. While the name "Directory" might seem superficially connected, its content does not match the claim or reasoning steps.
4. Context 0 ("Ten-code"): This context is about codes developed for public-safety communication, which is entirely unrelated to the claim.

Question:Where was the person featured on the Chester Arthur coin born?
golden idx: [14, 19]
step-by-step think: 
1. The reasoning steps involve two parts: identifying who the Chester Arthur coin features (Alice Paul) and determining Alice Paul's place of birth (Mount Laurel Township). Thus, contexts most closely related to Alice Paul, Chester Arthur coin, and Mount Laurel Township will be most relevant. 
2. Titles and paragraph texts containing references to Alice Paul, her achievements, her place of birth, or Chester Arthur will score highly for relevance to the claim. 
3. Contexts with specific mentions of Mount Laurel Township or details about Alice Paul's life, birthplace, or connection to the Chester Arthur coin will likely contain the answer and therefore score higher on likelihood.
4. Combine the relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to rank the contexts accordingly.

idx: [19, 14, 0, 1, 3, 4, 10, 7, 9, 6, 8, 17, 15, 2, 16, 18]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts effectively, I will follow these steps: 
1. Match with reasoning steps: I will look for contexts addressing the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps ("Chester Arthur coin features Alice Paul" and "Alice Paul's place of birth is Mount Laurel Township"). Contexts specifically mentioning "Alice Paul" and "Mount Laurel Township" will score higher.
2. Relevance to the claim: The claim seeks information about the birthplace of the person on the Chester Arthur coin (Alice Paul), so paragraphs discussing Alice Paul or her birthplace are more relevant.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts directly discussing Alice Paul's biography, birthplace, or the Chester Arthur coin providing details about its featured person are likely to contain the answer.

Analysis of contexts:
- Context 19 (Paulsdale): Clearly states that Alice Paul was born in Mount Laurel Township. High match with the second reasoning step and highly relevant to the claim.
- Context 14 (List of First Ladies of the United States): States the Chester A. Arthur coin features suffragette Alice Paul, thereby connecting to the first reasoning step. While it mentions Alice Paul, it does not discuss her birthplace.
- Other contexts like Contexts 4, 10, 15 are unrelated to the claim's entities or reasoning steps. Context titles such as "United States dollar" (9, 16), "Two pounds (British coin)" (6), and others are irrelevant to Alice Paul or her birthplace.

Based on the analysis:
1. Context 19 (Paulsdale) provides direct information about Alice Paul's birthplace, making it the most relevant.
2. Context 14 mentions the Chester Arthur coin featuring Alice Paul, tying it to the reasoning steps.
3. All other contexts lack mention of Alice Paul, Mount Laurel Township, or Chester Arthur coins, making them far less relevant.

idx: [19, 14]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will analyze the following factors:
1. **Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning_steps**: The reasoning steps mention "Chester Arthur coin" and "Alice Paul," along with her "place of birth," which is "Mount Laurel Township." I will prioritize contexts that explicitly mention these entities or closely align with them.
2. **Relevance to the claim**: I will judge how closely the context aligns with the claim, including its connection to Alice Paul or Chester Arthur coin-related contexts.
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: I will assess how likely it is for the context to provide information about Alice Paul's place of birth.

With this in mind:
- Context 19 explicitly states that Paulsdale in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey, was Alice Paul's birthplace, making it directly relevant and highly likely to contain the answer.
- Context 14 explains the connection between Alice Paul and the Chester Arthur coin, providing essential background.
- Other contexts mentioning Chester or Arthur without any connection to Alice Paul or her birthplace are less relevant.

I will score and rank them accordingly.

# idx: [19, 14, 1, 3, 2, 16, 18, 15]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The first reasoning step asks who the Chester Arthur coin features, and the second step links Alice Paul to her place of birth, Mount Laurel Township. Context 19 states that Paulsdale, in Mount Laurel Township, was the birthplace of Alice Paul. It directly matches both reasoning steps and is highly relevant and informative, likely containing the answer. 
2. Context 14 directly connects the Chester Arthur coin to Alice Paul, describing her role as the suffragette depicted on the coin. This context is crucial for addressing the first reasoning step and provides the necessary linkage to Alice Paul, though it does not directly address her place of birth.
3. Context 1 mentions Chester Alan Arthur II, not directly addressing Alice Paul or her connection to the coin or place of birth. It is irrelevant to the claim. 
4. Context 3 discusses the Immigration Act of 1882, signed by Chester A. Arthur, which is unrelated to Alice Paul or her place of birth and does not contribute to answering the claim.

Question:Since 2004, what is the location of the body to which, if a matter is not specifically reserved, it is devolved?
golden idx: [3, 7]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the key entities and relationships in the reasoning steps:
   - Entity: Matters not specifically reserved.
   - Relationship: Automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament.
   - Entities and Location: Scottish Parliament and its official home since 2004 is the Scottish Parliament Building in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh.
   
2. Analyze the relevance of each context to the claim about the devolution process and the location of the Scottish Parliament since 2004 based on the reasoning steps.

3. Prioritize contexts that mention the Scottish Parliament, its legislative powers pertaining to devolution, or the specific location of its building since 2004.

4. Determine the informativeness and likelihood of each context containing the answer:
   - High scores for details on the Scottish Parliament, its devolved matters, and its building location since 2004.
   - Medium scores for contexts indirectly related to devolution or Scotland's legislative processes.
   - Low scores for unrelated or tangential paragraphs.

5. Combine scores for relevance, informativeness, and likelihood, and rank contexts accordingly.

6. Select the top 16 contexts based on these final scores.

# idx: [3, 4, 7, 12, 8, 18, 6, 5, 1, 19, 9, 2, 14, 10, 13, 11]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will follow the given criteria:  
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The question and reasoning steps specifically reference "Scottish Parliament," "devolved matters," and "Scottish Parliament Building since 2004." Contexts that discuss these entities or relationships will score higher.  
2. Relevance to the claim: I will focus on whether the context is directly connected to the location of devolved matters or the Scottish Parliament Building.  
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that contain specific information about the Scottish Parliament's legislative role and its official building since 2004 have the highest likelihood of answering the claim.  
Using these factors, I will rank the contexts.  

1. Context (idx: 3): Discusses the official home of Scottish Parliament since 2004 and directly mentions its location (Scottish Parliament Building in Holyrood, Edinburgh). Matches reasoning step "Where has the official home of Scottish Parliament been since 2004?"
2. Context (idx: 7): Explains that all matters not specifically reserved are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Matches reasoning step "If a matter is not specifically reserved, who is it devolved to?"
3. Context (idx: 4): Provides background on Scottish Parliament, its foundation as part of devolution, and its reserved versus devolved powers. Relevant to the overall reasoning steps.
4. Context (idx: 12): Mentions devolved matters directly, like bank holidays in Scotland. Less specific but relevant to devolution.
5. Context (idx: 18): Discusses the Government Statistical Service and devolved administrations, which somewhat ties to the devolution framework.
6. Context (idx: 1): While this discusses reserved seats in the Iranian Parliament, it is tangentially related to the concept of devolution, though highly indirect. 
7. Context (idx: 6): Mentions a sports development site in England, which is not relevant but mentions England, potentially linking it to UK contexts. 
8. Context (idx: 11): Discusses speculative oil pricing without direct relevance but may link to UK institution regulation.

Unused contexts fail to meaningfully connect to the claim or reasoning steps.

Context idx 3 ("Scottish Parliament"): This context directly relates to the claim as it explicitly mentions that the Scottish Parliament Building in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh has been the official home of the Scottish Parliament since September 2004. It aligns with the reasoning steps involving the location of the body where devolved matters go since 2004 and is highly relevant to the claim. 
2. Context idx 7 ("Scottish Parliament"): This context is crucial as it explains that "all matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament," directly addressing the first reasoning step. It is integral to understanding the legislative devolution and aligns strongly with the claim.
3. Context idx 4 ("Scottish Parliament"): This context provides additional background on the evolution of the Scottish Parliament, including its legislative competence and powers following the Scotland Act. While less specific about the 2004 timeline or the building's location, it provides essential contextual information relevant to the claim.
4. Context idx 12 ("Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II"): This context indirectly discusses devolved matters with an example of national holidays in Scotland. However, it is less relevant and less specific to the reasoning steps about the location of the Scottish Parliament.

Other contexts, like idx 18, idx 1, idx 6, and idx 11, are unrelated to the reasoning steps or the claim, focusing instead on unrelated topics such as statistical services, Iran, Oakwell Stadium, or oil futures speculation, and are thus not considered in the top-ranked contexts.

# idx: [3, 7, 4, 12]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 3 ("Scottish Parliament") is highly relevant. It provides detailed information on the location of the Scottish Parliament building since 2004, specifically stating that it is in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. This directly matches the reasoning step asking about the location of the Scottish Parliament since 2004. It is highly likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context with idx 7 ("Scottish Parliament") explains that matters not specifically reserved are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. This perfectly matches the first reasoning step about which body such matters are devolved to. This context is also highly relevant.
3. Context with idx 4 ("Scottish Parliament") discusses devolution and the framework under which the Scottish Parliament can legislate. Although it is related to the Scottish Parliament's powers, it does not explicitly address the specific location of the Parliament since 2004 or the automatic devolution of unspecified matters, making it slightly less relevant compared to idx 3 and idx 7.
4. Context with idx 12 ("Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II") discusses devolved powers but focuses on national holidays in Scotland. It is tangentially related but does not provide specific information about the location of the Scottish Parliament or which matters are devolved, making it less relevant.

Question:The city which contains Broadhurst Park shares a border with what town?
golden idx: [6, 11]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Broadhurst Park," "Moston," and "shares border with Middleton." 
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. Highly relevant contexts would directly mention Broadhurst Park, Moston, and Middleton. 
3. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on its relation to the claim and reasoning steps, especially if the context elaborates on borders shared by Moston or provides geographical details.
4. Evaluate the likelihood score based on whether the context is likely to contain information about the specific town that shares a border with Moston.
5. Combine all scores to rank the contexts and select the top 16 ranked contexts.

# Specific evaluation of contexts:
1. Context 11 mentions "Broadhurst Park," "Moston," and provides direct information about its location, making it highly relevant.
2. Context 6 mentions Chadderton, Middleton, and Moston, directly providing information on geographical proximity and borders. This is crucial to the reasoning steps.
3. Other contexts like 4, 12, and 10 mention geographical borders but lack direct relevance to Moston or Middleton.

# idx: [11, 6, 4, 5, 10, 12, 0, 3, 13, 7, 1, 2, 14, 9, 15, 18]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will evaluate each based on three criteria: (1) Alignment with entities or relationships from the reasoning steps. Here, "Broadhurst Park," "Moston," "shares border with," and "Middleton" are the central elements to match. References to Broadhurst Park's location, Moston, and its surrounding geography will be prioritized. (2) Relevance to the claim about a city's border-sharing town in proximity to Broadhurst Park. Contexts discussing Moston's borders, neighboring towns, or its geographical context are most relevant. (3) Likelihood of providing the answer—whether the paragraph directly or indirectly provides the border-sharing information. High-scoring contexts must meet multiple criteria closely.
- Context 11 ("Broadhurst Park") is crucial as it discusses Broadhurst Park's exact location in Moston, tying directly to the reasoning steps.
- Context 6 ("Greengate, Greater Manchester") details Moston's geography and mentions Middleton, the town it shares a border with, making it highly relevant and informative.
- Contexts like 4, 3, and 2 are irrelevant as they focus on unrelated places and borders, such as Oak Lawn's suburbs or international borders.
- Contexts that mention borders with unrelated areas, such as context 1 ("Adaba") and 9 ("Thirukkanur"), are low-relevance.
- Contexts closely discussing Moston or its neighboring areas hold the most promise for containing the answer.

# idx: [11, 6, 14, 1, 9, 2, 4, 0]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 11 ("Broadhurst Park") is highly relevant as it directly mentions Broadhurst Park and its location in Moston, Manchester. This aligns with the reasoning step "Broadhurst Park >> located in the administrative territorial entity >>>> Moston." It is very likely to contain information relevant to the claim.
2. Context 6 ("Greengate, Greater Manchester") mentions Moston and its proximity to Middleton, which aligns with the reasoning step "Moston >> shares border with >>>> Middleton." This makes it highly relevant to the claim and likely to contain the answer.
3. Context 4 ("Oak Lawn, Illinois") discusses shared borders, but it is not directly related to Moston or Middleton. While it provides general information about shared borders, it is less relevant to the specific claim.
4. Context 9 ("Thirukkanur") mentions shared borders but is unrelated to Moston or Middleton. It is less relevant and unlikely to contain the answer compared to the other contexts.

# idx: [11, 6, 4, 9]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with `idx: 11` ("Broadhurst Park"): This context directly mentions Broadhurst Park, identifying its location in Moston, Manchester, which is part of the reasoning steps. It also confirms its connection to Moston, making it highly relevant and likely to contain needed information.
2. Context with `idx: 6` ("Greengate, Greater Manchester"): This context connects Moston to its neighboring towns, including Middleton, which matches a key reasoning step regarding the border between Moston and Middleton. It is informative and likely to contain the answer to the claim.
3. Context with `idx: 4` ("Oak Lawn, Illinois"): This mentions an entirely different location (Oak Lawn in Illinois) that does not align with the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. It is irrelevant to the claim.
4. Context with `idx: 9` ("Thirukkanur"): This references a village in Puducherry, India, which is not related to the entities or locations mentioned in the reasoning steps. It is irrelevant.

step-by-step think:  
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Metalworks Studios >> founded by >>>> Gil Moore", "Gil Moore >> record label >>>> TML Entertainment".  
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on matches to "Metalworks Studios", "Gil Moore", and "TML Entertainment", as well as general connections to record labels.  
3. Assess informativeness based on how closely the context discusses the entities in detail, especially regarding the record label TML Entertainment.  
4. Evaluate the likelihood of the context containing the answer based on explicit mention of the reasoning steps' relationships or entities.  
5. Combine relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to determine the final score for each context.  
6. Rank the contexts based on the scores and select the top 16.

idx: [1, 9, 0, 8, 12, 6, 10, 13, 15, 18, 19, 3, 7, 17, 5, 14]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will follow these steps:
1. Determine if the context explicitly matches the reasoning steps, particularly the entities “Metalworks Studios,” “Gil Moore,” and “TML Entertainment,” and their respective relationships.
2. Assess which contexts are directly relevant to the claim about the record label of the founder of Metalworks Studios.
3. Evaluate the likelihood of each context providing the answer to the claim, based on its content.

- Context 9 mentions Gil Moore as the founder of Metalworks Studios, making it highly relevant and a strong candidate for directly addressing the claim.
- Context 1 discusses TML Entertainment, which matches the second reasoning step linking Gil Moore to the record label, and seems to answer the claim.
- Context 0 and others like 8 and 12 mention unrelated entities or labels, making them less relevant to the claim.
- Context 6, 3, 5, and others mention record labels or founders irrelevant to Gil Moore or Metalworks Studios.

Based on these evaluations, I will rank the contexts accordingly.

idx: [9, 1, 0, 6, 8, 12, 3, 5]

# step-by-step think: 

1. Context {"idx": 9, "title": "Metalworks Institute"}: This context directly mentions Gil Moore as the founder of Metalworks Studios, which aligns with the first reasoning step "Metalworks Studios >> founded by >>>> Gil Moore." It also establishes a clear relationship to the claim and is highly relevant and likely informative. 

2. Context {"idx": 1, "title": "TML Entertainment"}: This context directly mentions "TML Entertainment," which is identified as Gil Moore's record label in the reasoning step "Gil Moore >> record label >>>> TML Entertainment." It provides detailed information about the label and its operations, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.

3. Context {"idx": 3, "title": "Biltmore Records"}: This context talks about record labels but does not specifically mention Gil Moore or TML Entertainment. It is ranked lower due to its lack of direct connection to the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.

4. Context {"idx": 5, "title": "Nothing Records"}: Like the previous, this context provides details about a record label, "Nothing Records." However, it is unrelated to the claim or the key entities mentioned in the reasoning steps, making it less relevant overall.

# idx: [9, 1, 3, 5]

# step-by-step think: 

1. The context with `title: Metalworks Institute` (idx: 9) explicitly states that Metalworks Studios was founded by Gil Moore, connecting directly to the reasoning step "Metalworks Studios >> founded by >>>> Gil Moore." Furthermore, it ties Gil Moore to Metalworks Studios, making it highly relevant to the claim and likely to provide partial information regarding the question timeline.

2. The context with `title: TML Entertainment` (idx: 1) provides detailed information about TML Entertainment, including its history and relationship to Triumph (Gil Moore's band), and directly fulfills the reasoning step "Gil Moore >> record label >>>> TML Entertainment." This makes it highly likely to contain the answer to the claim about the specific record label.

3. The context titled `Nothing Records` (idx: 5) provides background information on another record label, but it does not mention Metalworks Studios, Gil Moore, or TML Entertainment. It is less relevant to the claim compared to idx 9 and idx 1.

4. The context titled `Biltmore Records` (idx: 3) is irrelevant as it discusses Biltmore Records, which has no connection to the claim.

Thus, idx 1 and 9 are the most relevant as they directly address the reasoning steps and the entities in the claim.

Question:What is the mouth of watercourse for the body of water where Bartram's Covered Bridge is located?
golden idx: [9, 18]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Bartram's Covered Bridge >> crosses >>>> Crum Creek" and "Crum Creek >> mouth of the watercourse >>>> Delaware River."
   - Primary entities are "Bartram's Covered Bridge," "Crum Creek," and "Delaware River."
   - The relationships are that Bartram's Covered Bridge spans Crum Creek, and the mouth of Crum Creek flows into the Delaware River.
2. Evaluate the relevance of each context based on how closely their titles or paragraph texts align with these entities and relationships:
   - Contexts mentioning "Bartram's Covered Bridge," "Crum Creek," or "Delaware River" will score highly as they are most likely to contain relevant information.
   - Contexts related to other rivers and bridges without connections to the reasoning steps will score lower.
3. Assess the informativeness of each context based on how much pertinent detail about the claim the context provides:
   - Contexts explicitly discussing the crossing of Crum Creek or its connection to the Delaware River will be prioritized.
4. Estimate the likelihood of each context containing the answer based on its alignment with the reasoning steps and entities.
5. Rank the contexts based on their combined relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores and select the top 16.

# idx: [18, 9, 1, 8, 6, 7, 19, 12, 0, 4, 14, 10, 5, 3, 16, 11]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will follow these steps: 1. Match the reasoning steps with entities or relationships in the context's title or paragraph_text. The reasoning steps mention "Bartram's Covered Bridge," "Crum Creek," and their relationship with the "Delaware River" as the mouth of the watercourse. 2. Prioritize contexts that directly mention these entities, especially those that discuss Bartram's Covered Bridge, Crum Creek, and its flow into the Delaware River. 3. Score contexts based on their relevance to the claim and their likelihood of containing the required information about the watercourse's mouth where Bartram's Covered Bridge is located. Contexts with coverage of Crum Creek and its connection to the Delaware River will be rated highest.
# Contexts’ ranking is structured to identify those that provide the essential linkage following the reasoning process as part of addressing the claim.
idx: [18, 9, 19, 8, 12, 7, 6, 0]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 18 ("Bartram's Covered Bridge"): This context directly mentions "Bartram's Covered Bridge" and provides detailed information about its location, including that it crosses Crum Creek. This aligns with the first reasoning step and is highly relevant to the claim. It is likely to contain useful information about the watercourse.
2. Context 9 ("Crum Creek"): This context directly discusses Crum Creek, including its flow into the Delaware River, which aligns with the second reasoning step. It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim about the mouth of the watercourse.
3. Context 19 ("Goodpasture Bridge"): While this context discusses a covered bridge, it is unrelated to Bartram's Covered Bridge or Crum Creek. It is not relevant to the claim or reasoning steps.
4. Context 8 ("Port of Melbourne"): This context discusses the Yarra River and the Port of Melbourne, which are unrelated to Bartram's Covered Bridge, Crum Creek, or the Delaware River. It is not relevant to the claim.
5. Context 12 ("Diehls Covered Bridge"): This context discusses a different covered bridge in Pennsylvania but does not mention Bartram's Covered Bridge, Crum Creek, or the Delaware River. It is not relevant to the claim.
6. Context 7 ("Warren Covered Bridge"): This context discusses a covered bridge in Vermont, which is unrelated to Bartram's Covered Bridge, Crum Creek, or the Delaware River. It is not relevant to the claim.
7. Context 6 ("Burt Henry Covered Bridge"): This context discusses a covered bridge in Vermont, which is unrelated to Bartram's Covered Bridge, Crum Creek, or the Delaware River. It is not relevant to the claim.
8. Context 0 ("Kintersburg Covered Bridge"): This context discusses a covered bridge in Pennsylvania but does not mention Bartram's Covered Bridge, Crum Creek, or the Delaware River. It is not relevant to the claim.

# idx: [18, 9, 12, 0]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 9 (Crum Creek): This context strongly matches the reasoning steps, as it explicitly mentions Crum Creek and its mouth of watercourse being the Delaware River. Since it directly connects the entities in the reasoning steps, it is very relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim. 
2. Context with idx 18 (Bartram's Covered Bridge): This context discusses Bartram's Covered Bridge in detail and states that it crosses over Crum Creek. Although it doesn't mention the mouth of Crum Creek's watercourse, it is still relevant since it establishes the connection between Bartram's Covered Bridge and Crum Creek.
3. Context with idx 12 (Diehls Covered Bridge): This context briefly mentions another covered bridge and its related watercourse. It is less relevant than idx 9 and idx 18 because it does not refer to Bartram's Covered Bridge, Crum Creek, or the Delaware River.
4. Context with idx 0 (Kintersburg Covered Bridge): This context is about another covered bridge unrelated to Bartram's Covered Bridge or Crum Creek and is the least relevant among the given contexts.

# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Ruler of the underworld in ancient Egypt >>> Osiris", "Osiris >>> part of >>> ancient Egyptian religion."
2. Calculate the relevance of each context by evaluating the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps:
   - High relevance: Contexts directly mentioning Osiris, ruler of the underworld, ancient Egyptian religion, or related concepts.
   - Medium relevance: Contexts with indirect mentions of ancient Egyptian mythology or religion.
   - Low relevance: Contexts unrelated to ancient Egypt, Osiris, or religion.
3. Assess the informativeness of each context:
   - High informativeness: Contexts containing detailed, specific information about Osiris, ancient Egyptian religion, or the underworld.
   - Medium informativeness: Contexts providing general background on ancient Egypt or mythical practices.
   - Low informativeness: Contexts lacking substantive content on key entities or claims.
4. Assess the likelihood of each context containing the answer to the claim, prioritizing specific mentions of Osiris or his role in ancient Egyptian religion.
5. Combine the scores for relevance, informativeness, and likelihood to derive a final ranking of contexts.
6. Rank the contexts based on the final scores and select the top 16.

# idx: [9, 17, 1, 13, 15, 8, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 11, 10, 2, 19, 12]

step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will follow these rules: 1. Assess the match between the context's title or paragraph text and the entities or relationships present in the reasoning steps ("Osiris" as the ruler of the underworld and "ancient Egyptian religion"). Any context directly mentioning either Osiris or ancient Egyptian religion will be ranked higher. 2. Evaluate relevance to the question about "Osiris being a part of ancient Egyptian religion." 3. Consider the likelihood of a context directly providing an answer or relevant information.

- Context 9 mentions Osiris explicitly and describes his role as the ruler of the underworld, including his association with rebirth and significance in ancient Egyptian beliefs, making it highly relevant.
- Context 17 discusses Osiris indirectly in the context of the underworld and mentions Hapi's role in protecting the throne of Osiris, connecting to ancient Egyptian religion and mythology.
- Context 1 focuses on the history and legacy of Egypt, including organized religion, providing some general context for ancient Egyptian religion but lacks specificity regarding Osiris.
- Context 13 explores the regalia of pharaohs and their connection to ancient Egyptian tradition, but it doesn't connect directly to Osiris or his role in the underworld.
- Context 15 discusses ancient Egyptian religion in the context of animal worship but doesn't specifically address Osiris or the underworld.
- Context 6 describes ruler cults in Egypt, but the information is indirect and less relevant to the specific claim about Osiris and ancient Egyptian religion.
- Context 7 mentions a specific historical figure in Egypt but has no connection to Osiris or ancient Egyptian religion.
- Context 19 discusses wedding rings and ancient Egypt, which is not relevant to Osiris or ancient Egyptian religion.

idx: [9, 17, 1, 13, 15, 6, 7, 19]

# step-by-step think:
1. The context titled "Green" (idx: 9) directly mentions "the ruler of the underworld, Osiris," and discusses aspects related to Osiris, such as his green face symbolizing health and rebirth. This is highly relevant to the reasoning step "Who was the ruler of the underworld in ancient Egypt? >>>> Osiris" and likely ties into the claim about Osiris being part of ancient Egyptian religion. It is informative and likely contains relevant information. 
2. The context titled "Hapi (Son of Horus)" (idx: 17) mentions Osiris as the ruler of the underworld and is closely tied to funerary practices and ancient Egyptian religion. This is directly related to the reasoning steps and is highly relevant to the claim, offering details about Osiris's prominence in ancient Egyptian beliefs.
3. The context titled "Egypt" (idx: 1) speaks about Ancient Egypt's relevance to organized religion, which aligns with "Osiris >> part of >>>> ancient Egyptian religion." This makes it pertinent to the claim, though it does not focus on Osiris specifically. It establishes a general background related to religion in ancient Egypt.
4. The context titled "Upper and Lower Egypt" (idx: 13) discusses the unification of regions in ancient Egypt and names figures like Narmer. While it does not focus on Osiris specifically, its connection to ancient Egyptian history and culture offers some relevance to the broader context of ancient Egyptian religion.

# idx: [9, 17, 1, 13]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context `idx: 9` discusses Osiris as the ruler of the underworld, directly matching the reasoning step that identifies Osiris as the ruler of the underworld in ancient Egypt. Additionally, it describes Osiris' role in the underworld and connects this to ancient Egyptian beliefs, making it highly relevant to the claim. This context is likely to contain information directly addressing the claim.  
2. Context `idx: 17` mentions Osiris in its description of Hapi, one of the Four sons of Horus, who protects the throne of Osiris in the underworld. While it is less focused on Osiris' role as part of ancient Egyptian religion overall, the mention of Osiris and the underworld is still relevant to the reasoning steps. This makes it the second most relevant context.
3. Context `idx: 1` provides general information about ancient Egyptian religion and its cultural heritage, which ties loosely to the reasoning step about Osiris being part of ancient Egyptian religion. However, it does not specifically focus on Osiris or his role in the underworld, making it less likely to address the claim directly. Still, it has some relevance as background on ancient Egyptian religion.

Question:What pantheon is the God of the underworld in ancient Egypt a part of?
golden idx: [10, 11]
# step-by-step think: 
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: 
   - The god of the underworld in ancient Egypt is Osiris.
   - Osiris is part of ancient Egyptian religion.
2. Evaluate the relevance of each context by identifying matches with the entities "Osiris," "god of the underworld," "ancient Egyptian religion," and related terms such as "Egyptian pantheon" or "Egyptian mythology."
3. Determine informativeness by analyzing the content of each context to see if it contains pertinent details about Osiris, ancient Egyptian religion, or the pantheon.
4. Assess the likelihood of each context containing the answer to the claim about the pantheon Osiris belongs to.
5. Rank contexts accordingly, prioritizing those that directly describe Osiris, his role in ancient Egyptian religion, or his membership in the pantheon.

# idx: [11, 10, 5, 6, 18, 0, 9, 3, 7, 12, 19, 4, 13, 2, 15, 1]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will follow these steps based on the given rules:  
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps focus on identifying the god of the underworld in ancient Egypt (Osiris) and linking this entity to its broader religious pantheon (ancient Egyptian religion). Contexts explicitly mentioning Osiris, his role as the god of the underworld, and ancient Egyptian religion will score higher.  
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts explicitly addressing Osiris' role, the ancient Egyptian pantheon, or related aspects of ancient Egyptian religion will score higher as they are relevant to determining what pantheon Osiris belongs to.  
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that explicitly mention Osiris, other gods of ancient Egypt, or the Egyptian pantheon are more likely to provide a definitive answer to the claim and will score the highest.

Now I will analyze the contexts:
- **Context idx 11:** This context is highly relevant as it explicitly discusses Osiris, his role as the god of the underworld, and his associations with ancient Egyptian religion. This directly matches the reasoning steps and likely contains the answer.  
- **Context idx 10:** This mentions the ancient Egyptian context ("Hapi, protecting the throne of Osiris in the underworld"). It complements information about Osiris and the underworld in ancient Egyptian religion, making it relevant.  
- **Context idx 5:** This provides information about gods in ancient Egyptian religion (e.g., Sobek, Hathor) and religious structures, which could add useful details about the pantheon.  
- **Context idx 1:** This is less relevant as it discusses an archaeologist who excavates in Egypt but does not directly address Osiris, the underworld, or the Egyptian pantheon.  
- **Contexts idx 6, 18, and 0:** These focus on Greek religion and mythology, which are irrelevant to the claim about Egyptian religion and deities.  
- **Context idx 15:** This mentions mythology related to the underworld but concerns Roman and Greek mythology (Pluto, Proserpina), which is irrelevant to Egyptian religion.  
- **Context idx 3, 4, 12, 13, 2, 9, and 7:** These are unrelated to Egyptian religion or the focus of the claim.  
   
Final assessment for ranking:
- Contexts 11 and 10 are the most directly relevant to the claim and reasoning steps.
- Context 5 provides supporting details about Egyptian religious practices that could offer contextual information.
- The rest provide limited direct relevance to the claim.

# idx: [11, 10, 5]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I will consider the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention "God of the underworld in ancient Egypt" (Osiris) and "Osiris" being part of "ancient Egyptian religion." I will prioritize contexts discussing Osiris and his role relative to the underworld and ancient Egyptian religion.
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts containing information about Osiris, the overall pantheon of ancient Egyptian gods, or related systems will be given higher priorities.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Based on the claim, likely contexts should describe Osiris and his association with the underworld as part of ancient Egyptian religious beliefs. Thus, contexts about the Egyptian underworld or Egyptian religious systems are likely sources.

Evaluation:
1. Context 11 ("Osiris") directly discusses Osiris as the god of the underworld and part of ancient Egyptian religion, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 10 ("Hapi (Son of Horus)") mentions the underworld and Osiris indirectly through Hapi's protective role in the underworld, but it does not focus on Osiris or the ancient Egyptian pantheon explicitly.
3. Context 5 ("Temple of Kom Ombo") details Egyptian gods like Sobek and Horus but is not directly relevant to the underworld or Osiris.
4. Context 19 ("Book of Exodus") does not contribute information about the ancient Egyptian religion or Osiris.
5. Context 6 and Context 18 ("Greece" and "Greek mythology") discuss Greek gods and are irrelevant to ancient Egypt or Osiris.
6. Other contexts (e.g., 7, 1, 12, etc.) are either irrelevant or unlikely to contain specific, useful information about Osiris or ancient Egyptian religion.

idx: [11, 10, 5, 4, 7, 0, 1, 13]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context titled "Osiris" (idx 11) is directly related to the reasoning step 'who was the god of the underworld in ancient egypt >>>> Osiris.' It provides detailed and comprehensive information about Osiris being the god of the underworld in ancient Egypt and his association with ancient Egyptian religion. This context is highly relevant and likely contains the answer to the claim.  
2. The context titled "Hapi (Son of Horus)" (idx 10) mentions Osiris and his significance in relation to the underworld, specifically referencing rituals and roles concerning the throne of Osiris. Though it focuses more on Hapi than directly on Osiris, it still offers relevant insights about ancient Egyptian religion and its pantheon.  
3. The context titled "Temple of Kom Ombo" (idx 5) discusses another part of Egyptian mythology, focusing on gods Sobek and Haroeris. While it is related to Egyptian religion, it does not specifically address the role of Osiris or the underworld. However, it remains somewhat tangentially informative about the broader pantheon of ancient Egyptian gods.

golden idx: [3, 19]
step-by-step think: 
1. Extract entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: Alhandra, place of birth, Vila Franca de Xira, Lisbon District, state.
2. Analyze each context's title and paragraph_text for mention of these entities or relationships: Vila Franca de Xira, Alhandra, Lisbon District, or anything linked to the state to which Vila Franca de Xira belongs. 
3. Assess the direct relevance of the context to the question (e.g., Alhandra's birthplace or the location of Vila Franca de Xira in Lisbon District).
4. Favor contexts that mention Alhandra or Vila Franca de Xira more directly and precisely, as these are more likely to hold the answer to the claim.
5. Combine these considerations to rank the contexts effectively and choose the top 16 based on relevance, informativeness, and answer likelihood.

idx: [19, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 9, 0, 7, 4, 13, 17, 18, 2, 5, 15]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will first analyze how strongly each context matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: "Alhandra >> place of birth >>> Vila Franca de Xira" and "In which state is Vila Franca de Xira located? >>> Lisbon District." Contexts that directly mention Vila Franca de Xira, Alhandra, or the Lisbon District, or provide information about where Vila Franca de Xira is located, will score highest. Among these, contexts that explicitly relate to Alhandra's birthplace or its location in Lisbon District have the strongest relevance to the claim. I will also evaluate the likelihood that a context may contain the precise answer to the question.
idx: [19, 3, 6, 2, 12, 4, 10, 5]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context idx 19: This context directly links "Alhandra" to his place of birth, "Vila Franca de Xira, Lisbon" and explicitly mentions both entities from the reasoning steps. It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context idx 3: This context provides detailed information about "Vila Franca de Xira," which is closely related to the reasoning steps as it describes the municipality and its location in the "Lisbon District." This makes it very informative for the claim.
3. Context idx 6: This context is about "Chirakkalkulam" and has no direct relevance to either the claim or the reasoning steps as it pertains to an area in Kerala, India. It is not likely to contain the answer.
4. Context idx 2: This context discusses Hilda Crosby Standish and her involvement in the birth control movement in Connecticut, which is unrelated to "Alhandra" or "Lisbon District." It is not relevant.
5. Context idx 12, 4, 10: These contexts all describe census-designated places in Pennsylvania, which are completely unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps.
6. Context idx 5: This context relates to a public artwork in Indianapolis, Indiana, and does not connect to the entities or reasoning steps in the claim.

# idx: [19, 3]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context 19: This context is directly relevant as it mentions "Alhandra," describes his birth in "Vila Franca de Xira," and notes its location in the "Lisbon District." It directly connects with both reasoning steps and is highly likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 3: This context explicitly discusses "Vila Franca de Xira," its location within the "Lisbon District," and provides significant details about the area. It directly aligns with the entities in the reasoning steps and is highly relevant.
3. Context 6: This context discusses "Chirakkalkulam," which does not align with the reasoning steps or mention "Alhandra," "Vila Franca de Xira," or "Lisbon District." It is unrelated to the claim.
4. Context 2: While this talks about a person's contributions to the birth control movement, it is unrelated to "Alhandra," "Vila Franca de Xira," or the "Lisbon District." It is not relevant to the claim or reasoning steps.
5. Context 12, Context 4, Context 10, Context 5: These contexts discuss places and topics unrelated to the claim, reasoning steps, or the geographic and biographic details mentioned. They are not relevant for addressing the claim.

step-by-step think:

1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "Vera Barbosa," "place of birth," "Vila Franca de Xira," and "Lisbon District." Key query: In which state is Vera Barbosa's birthplace (Vila Franca de Xira) located? Identify contexts containing these entities.
2. Calculate the relevance score for each context based on the match between the context's title or paragraph_text and the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.
   - Direct mention of "Vera Barbosa" or her birthplace "Vila Franca de Xira" or its location "Lisbon District" is highly relevant.
   - Titles with "Vera Barbosa," "Vila Franca de Xira," or related districts are critical.
3. Calculate the informativeness score for each context based on how detailed and relevant the description is to the claim.
4. Calculate the likelihood score for each context based on the probability that the context contains the specific information necessary to answer the claim.
5. Combine relevance, informativeness, and likelihood scores to rank the contexts effectively.
6. Select the top 16 ranked contexts.

idx: [6, 5, 8, 7, 0, 2, 10, 1, 4, 3, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts, I considered the following criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps include "Vera Barbosa," "place of birth," "Vila Franca de Xira," and its connection to the "Lisbon District." Contexts with direct mentions of these entities (e.g., Vera Barbosa, Vila Franca de Xira, Lisbon District) score higher.
2. Relevance to the claim: The claim asks about the state in which Vera Barbosa's birthplace, Vila Franca de Xira, is located. Contexts most relevant to this location and its connection to Lisbon District are emphasized.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts explicitly discussing Vila Franca de Xira or Vera Barbosa are likely to contain the answer and are prioritized.

- Context 6 directly mentions that Vera Barbosa was born in Vila Franca de Xira and provides key personal details, making it highly relevant.
- Context 5 describes Vila Franca de Xira as a municipality located in the Lisbon District, which directly answers the claim.
- Contexts 7, 4, 10, 9, and others have no or very limited relevance to the entities, relationships, or questions in the reasoning.

# idx: [6, 5, 8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 17]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 6 ("Vera Barbosa"): This context directly matches the first reasoning step ('Vera Barbosa >> place of birth >>>> Vila Franca de Xira') as it explicitly states Vera Barbosa was born in Vila Franca de Xira. It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer to the claim since it provides key information about her place of birth. 
2. Context 5 ("Vila Franca de Xira"): This context matches the second reasoning step ('In which state is Vila Franca de Xira located? >>>> Lisbon District'), as it confirms that Vila Franca de Xira is a municipality in the Lisbon District, Portugal. It is highly relevant to the claim and adds crucial geographical information.
3. Context 8 ("Valverde de la Vera"): This context superficially seems relevant because it includes "Vera" in its title, but it is about a municipality in Spain and unrelated to the reasoning steps or claim.
4. Context 2 ("Fingerville, South Carolina"): This context does not match the reasoning steps or claim clearly as it pertains to a location in South Carolina and does not relate to Vera Barbosa or Vila Franca de Xira.

Based on reasoning step alignment, relevance, and likelihood of containing the answer, the top 4 contexts should only include those closely related to the reasoning steps.

# idx: [6, 5, 8, 2]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context with idx 6 mentions "Vera Barbosa" and specifies her birthplace as "Vila Franca de Xira," directly addressing the reasoning step "Vera Barbosa >> place of birth >>>> Vila Franca de Xira." Additionally, it supports the query by validating her birth location, making it highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. The context with idx 5 specifically mentions "Vila Franca de Xira" and provides information about its location in the Lisbon District. This aligns with the reasoning step "In which state is Vila Franca de Xira located? >>>> Lisbon District." It complements the answer by affirming the state where Vila Franca de Xira is located.
3. The context with idx 8, while mentioning "Valverde de la Vera," is unrelated to "Vera Barbosa" or "Vila Franca de Xira." Similarly, the context with idx 2 discusses a location in South Carolina (Fingerville), which is irrelevant to the claim. These do not align with the reasoning steps or the claim.
4. Based on relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer, idx 6 and idx 5 are the top-ranked contexts.

Question:In which state is Póvoa de Santa Iria's municipality located?
golden idx: [13, 17]
# step-by-step think:
1. The reasoning steps involve locating "Póvoa de Santa Iria" within its territorial entity "Vila Franca de Xira" and identifying which state "Vila Franca de Xira" is located in: "Lisbon District."
2. Contexts directly mentioning "Póvoa de Santa Iria," "Vila Franca de Xira," or "Lisbon District" are highly relevant to answering the claim and therefore prioritized.
3. Contexts describing other unrelated locations, municipalities, or regions were deprioritized as they do not pertain to the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps.
4. Paragraphs with detailed information about the location or administrative details of "Póvoa de Santa Iria" or "Vila Franca de Xira" are likely to contain the answer.
5. Rankings were finalized by combining how well the contexts matched the entities or relationships (relevance) and how likely they were to answer the claim (informativeness) into a final score.

# idx: [17, 13, 6, 0, 12, 7, 3, 19, 14, 9, 15, 16, 18, 11, 2, 8]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will carefully address the following considerations: 
1. Match with reasoning steps: The entities and relationships in the reasoning steps such as "Póvoa de Santa Iria >> located in the administrative territorial entity >>> Vila Franca de Xira" and "In which state is Vila Franca de Xira located? >>> Lisbon District" will guide the prioritization.
2. Relevance to the claim: The context should provide information regarding the geographic or administrative relationships of Póvoa de Santa Iria, Vila Franca de Xira, or the Lisbon district.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that explicitly discuss the location and administrative hierarchy of these areas will be scored higher.

Analyzing the given contexts:
1. **Context 17** ("Póvoa de Santa Iria e Forte da Casa"): Highly relevant as it directly identifies Póvoa de Santa Iria as located in the municipality of Vila Franca de Xira, which matches the reasoning step.
2. **Context 13** ("Vila Franca de Xira"): Highly relevant as it confirms Vila Franca de Xira is located in the Lisbon District, correlating to the second reasoning step and addressing the claim indirectly.
3. Contexts like **6, 0, 11, 7, 12, and others** are unrelated since they do not contain information regarding Póvoa de Santa Iria, Vila Franca de Xira, or Lisbon District.

Based on this evaluation, I will rank the most relevant contexts that align closely with both reasoning steps and the claim.

# idx: [17, 13]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will follow these criteria: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps mention that Póvoa de Santa Iria is located in the municipality of Vila Franca de Xira, which is in Lisbon District, Portugal. Thus, contexts explicitly dealing with Póvoa de Santa Iria, Vila Franca de Xira, or Lisbon District will score higher.
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts providing specific information about Póvoa de Santa Iria and its administrative hierarchy will be prioritized.
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts explaining the administrative entity or location of Póvoa de Santa Iria and Vila Franca de Xira are more likely to contain the answer.

1. Context `17` mentions Póvoa de Santa Iria and its association with Vila Franca de Xira along with broader details about this municipality. This aligns strongly with the reasoning steps and claim.
2. Context `13` explicitly discusses Vila Franca de Xira as a municipality in the Lisbon District, aligning directly with the reasoning steps and the claim.
3. Context `6` talks about administrative divisions in Portugal but does not directly connect to Vila Franca de Xira or Lisbon District hence less relevant.
4. Context `0` discusses a different location called Póvoa de Cervães and doesn't relate to the claim.
5. Contexts `12`, `7`, `3`, and others discuss places and municipalities unrelated to Póvoa de Santa Iria or the Lisbon District.
6. Specifically, contexts like `8` discussing federalism or unrelated municipality information will be less relevant.

Ranking will focus on contexts high in relevance to the claim.

# idx: [17, 13, 6, 0, 12, 7, 3, 8]

# step-by-step think: 
1. Context with idx 13 titled "Vila Franca de Xira" directly mentions the municipality of Vila Franca de Xira and places it in the Lisbon District, which aligns with the reasoning step asking "In which state is Vila Franca de Xira located?" This context is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer. 
2. Context with idx 17 titled "Póvoa de Santa Iria e Forte da Casa" references Póvoa de Santa Iria as a part of the municipality of Vila Franca de Xira, which aligns with the step connecting Póvoa de Santa Iria to that municipality. This is relevant but provides less direct information on the Lisbon District being the state. 
3. Context with idx 6 titled "Greater Metropolitan Area of Minho" does mention other municipalities and regions within Portugal but provides less direct relevance to Póvoa de Santa Iria or Vila Franca de Xira, making it less likely to contain the answer.

Question:How old was Mary when engaged to the person from whom São José dos Campos takes it's name?
golden idx: [18, 19]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps involve São José dos Campos being named after Joseph, and determining Mary's age (approximately 12–14 years old) at the time she was betrothed to Joseph. Key entities are São José dos Campos, Joseph, Mary, and her betrothal age. Relevant biblical and historical context about Joseph and Mary is significant.
2. Evaluate the contexts for relevance:
   - Examine titles and paragraph texts for mentions of São José dos Campos, Joseph, Mary, betrothal, or related entities in a theological or historical perspective.
   - Assess contexts providing information about Mary's age or São José dos Campos' namesake.
3. Assess informativeness: Prioritize contexts that connect directly to the claim or reasoning steps.
4. Assess the likelihood of containing the answer: Focus on contexts discussing Mary's betrothal or explicitly clarifying São José dos Campos' relationship to Joseph.
5. Combine the above factors, rank contexts based on scores, and identify the top 16 contexts.

# idx: [19, 1, 18, 9, 13, 8, 17, 7, 4, 0, 5, 2, 3, 6, 14, 16]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will evaluate them based on the following criteria:
1. **Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps**: The reasoning steps mention "São José dos Campos" being named after "Joseph" and Mary being betrothed at the age of 12-14. Contexts addressing São José dos Campos, Joseph, or details of Mary's age of betrothal will be prioritized.
2. **Relevance to the claim**: Priority will be given to contexts that discuss Mary's age during her betrothal or the significance of São José dos Campos and its connection to Joseph.
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts that explicitly discuss Mary's betrothal age or Joseph in relation to São José dos Campos are more likely to contain the answer and will be ranked higher.

Analysis of contexts:
- Context 19 discusses São José dos Campos but does not address its name's connection to Joseph or Mary's age. Relevant but limited for the specific claim.
- Context 1 discusses Mary's life and mentions her age being 12 when she was betrothed, aligning strongly with the reasoning steps.
- Context 18 explicitly states Mary was 12–14 when betrothed to Joseph, directly addressing the claim.
- Contexts 9, 13, 8, 17, 7, 4, 0, 5, 2, 3, 6, 14, and 16 do not mention São José dos Campos, Joseph, or details about Mary's age and are irrelevant.
- Context 2 provides a general historical discussion but does not relate to Mary's betrothal or São José dos Campos.

# idx: [18, 1, 19, 9, 13, 8, 17, 14]

# step-by-step think: 
1. The context with idx 18 specifies that Mary was 12-14 years old when betrothed to Joseph, directly aligned with the reasoning step "When she was betrothed to Joseph, approximately how old was Mary?" and relevant to determining Mary's age during her engagement to Joseph.
2. The context with idx 1 provides additional details about Mary's life, particularly emphasizing her betrothal to a widower at about 12 years old, aligning with the reasoning steps and enhancing understanding of Mary's age at the time.
3. The context with idx 19 gives an explanation of São José dos Campos, which is explicitly mentioned in the claim and indirectly tied to the reasoning step revolving around the city's name being derived from Joseph.
4. The context with idx 14 discusses São Paulo but lacks precise information about the connection to São José dos Campos or Mary being betrothed to Joseph. However, it partially overlaps and holds some relevance. 

# idx: [18, 1, 19, 14]

step-by-step think: 
1. Context 18 discusses Mary's age when she was betrothed to Joseph and explicitly states that some apocryphal accounts mention her age as 12–14. This directly matches the reasoning step "When she was betrothed to Joseph, approximately how old was Mary? >>>> 12–14 years old" and is highly relevant to the claim. It is very likely to contain the answer.
2. Context 1 also mentions Mary's betrothal age, which aligns with the reasoning step related to Mary's age during her betrothal to Joseph. It expands further with details from the Protoevangelium of James, making it relevant to the claim and likely to contain the answer.
3. Context 19 provides information about São José dos Campos, specifically pointing out the naming of the city after Saint Joseph. It aligns with the reasoning step "São José dos Campos >> named after >>>> Joseph" but is less likely to address the query about Mary's age compared to contexts 18 and 1.

Question:Where was Mary's betrothed born?
golden idx: [4, 11]
step-by-step think: 
1. Analyze the reasoning steps: "Who was Mary betrothed to? >>>> Joseph" and "Joseph >> place of birth >>>> Nazareth." Therefore, we need contexts about Mary, Joseph, their betrothal, and Joseph's place of birth (Nazareth).
2. Evaluate the contexts for relevance to Joseph, Mary, betrothal, and place of birth (Nazareth).
3. Check for proximity to the reasoning steps in both context titles and paragraph_text.
4. Rank contexts that explicitly discuss Joseph, Mary, and Nazareth or the relationship between them higher.
5. Identify the most relevant contexts with a high likelihood of containing the answer to the claim and rank accordingly.

idx: [10, 5, 11, 19, 4, 12, 6, 3, 17, 2, 8, 13, 7, 9, 18, 16]

# step-by-step think: In order to rank the contexts effectively, I will evaluate them systematically according to the following criteria:
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: The reasoning steps indicate we need information about Joseph (Mary's betrothed) and, specifically, his place of birth (Nazareth). Thus, contexts mentioning Joseph and Nazareth are more relevant.
2. Relevance to the claim: A context directly mentioning Joseph's birth or his association with Nazareth will score highly.
3. The likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that provide specific and pertinent details about Joseph, his betrothal to Mary, or Nazareth are more likely to answer the claim.

**Analysis of Contexts:**
- **Context idx 10**: Refers to Mary in Nazareth and mentions her betrothal to Joseph; also includes an important detail about Joseph. Likely relevant.
- **Context idx 5**: Discusses Mary’s betrothal to Joseph and how it occurred in a religious setting, but does not mention Nazareth or Joseph's birth.
- **Context idx 4**: Mentions "Sisters of St Joseph of Nazareth," which may have relevance due to the term "Joseph" and "Nazareth." However, it refers to a different concept unrelated to the reasoning steps.
- **Context idx 19**: Discusses Orthodox traditions related to Mary but does not mention Joseph or Nazareth.
- **Context idx 11**: Mentions Mary’s betrothal to Joseph with some apocryphal details, including his age, but nothing about his place of birth.
- **Context idx 12**: Refers to Ephesus as a significant place for Mary but does not mention Joseph or his birthplace.
- **Context idx 6**: Focuses on a house near Ephesus linked to Mary; irrelevant to Nazareth or Joseph's birthplace.
- **Context idx 3, 2, 8, 13, 7, 9, 18, 16**: These contexts are unrelated to the reasoning steps, either discussing unrelated historical figures/events or fictional characters.

Given these evaluations, I will rank the following contexts:
1. Context idx 10 (high relevance due to mention of Nazareth and Joseph's betrothal to Mary).
2. Context idx 5 (mentions Joseph's betrothal process but lacks details about his birthplace).
3. Context idx 11 (mentions Mary’s betrothal to Joseph but not his birthplace).
4. Context idx 4 (mentions "Nazareth" but is unrelated to the claim or reasoning steps).
5. Context idx 19 (mentions Mary in the Orthodox context, slightly relevant).
6. Context idx 12 (focuses on Ephesus, only tangentially related to Mary).
7. Context idx 6 (mentions Ephesus linked to Mary but irrelevant to Joseph or Nazareth).
8. Context idx 3 (unrelated details).

# idx: [10, 5, 11, 4, 19, 12, 6, 3]

# step-by-step think: 1. "Mary, mother of Jesus" contexts (idx: 10 and idx: 5) contain detailed discussions on Mary and her betrothal to Joseph. They provide strong connections to the entities in the reasoning steps (e.g., Mary, Joseph, and their relationship). These contexts are highly relevant and likely to contain information about Joseph and potentially his origin. 2. Context (idx: 4, "Sisters of Saint Joseph of Nazareth") mentions Joseph and Nazareth in the title, which are key entities in the reasoning steps. However, it discusses a religious congregation and not Joseph's birthplace, making it less likely to contain the answer. 3. Context (idx: 11, "Mary, mother of Jesus") discusses details surrounding Mary’s betrothal but does not mention Joseph's origin or birthplace, making it less relevant. 4. Other contexts (idx: 19, 12, 6, 3) do not include relevant details about Joseph or his birthplace, and they are less connected to the reasoning steps or the claim.
idx: [10, 5, 4, 11]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context 10: This context discusses Mary and her betrothal to Joseph, who is a key entity in the reasoning step ("Who was Mary betrothed to? >>>> Joseph"). It also references Nazareth, which is linked to the reasoning ("Joseph >> place of birth >>>> Nazareth"). This makes it highly relevant, and it is likely to contain the answer to the claim.
2. Context 4: This context's title, "Sisters of St Joseph of Nazareth," connects strongly to the place "Nazareth" and "Joseph" in the reasoning steps. However, it focuses on a religious congregation and may not directly address the claim about Joseph's birthplace, making it slightly less relevant than Context 10.
3. Context 11: This context provides information on the apocryphal aspects of Mary's life, mentioning her betrothal to Joseph, which is directly relevant to the reasoning. However, it does not contain direct details about Joseph's place of birth, so it ranks slightly lower compared to Context 10.

Question:Where is the country with ISO code ISO 3166-2:CV located?
golden idx: [11, 13]
# step-by-step think:
1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: "ISO 3166-2:CV >> country >>>> Cabo Verde", "Where is Cabo Verde located? >>>> central Atlantic Ocean".
2. Contexts referencing "ISO 3166-2:CV" (specific ISO code for Cabo Verde) are likely to be highly relevant as they directly address the claim's ISO code.
3. Contexts mentioning "Cabo Verde" or providing geographical information about it (such as its location in the central Atlantic Ocean) are also highly relevant.
4. Evaluate the likelihood of each context to provide the answer about the location of the country corresponding to ISO 3166-2:CV, using this hierarchy: (1) explicit mention of the ISO code "CV" linked to Cabo Verde, (2) detailed information about Cabo Verde's location.
5. Rank the contexts based on relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer. Then, select the top 16 ranked contexts.

# idx: [13, 11, 9, 0, 18, 1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 4, 15, 14]

# step-by-step think: To rank the contexts, I will consider the following points: 
1. Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps: Contexts should explicitly reference "ISO 3166-2:CV", "Cabo Verde", or "central Atlantic Ocean" since they are key in the reasoning steps. 
2. Relevance to the claim: Contexts that explain the location of Cabo Verde or detail the ISO code "ISO 3166-2:CV" are highly relevant. 
3. Likelihood of containing the answer: Contexts that directly discuss Cabo Verde's location or its geographical placement should be prioritized to answer the claim effectively.

Based on the analysis:
- Context 13 is highly relevant as it explicitly explains that ISO 3166-2:CV corresponds to Cabo Verde. 
- Context 11 provides detailed information about Cabo Verde, including its location in the central Atlantic Ocean.
- Other contexts (e.g., those referring to different ISO codes, such as "ISO 3166-2:KM" or "ISO 3166-2:BT") are unrelated to the claim.

idx: [13, 11]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will follow these steps:  
1. **Match with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps**: I will prioritize contexts that mention "ISO 3166-2:CV," "Cabo Verde," or "central Atlantic Ocean," as these are the key entities and relationships in the reasoning steps.  
2. **Relevance to the claim**: Contexts that provide information about the location of Cabo Verde or its ISO code will be ranked higher.  
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts that explicitly describe Cabo Verde's location or its ISO code are more likely to contain the answer and will be prioritized.  

### Analysis of Contexts:  
- **Context 13**: Mentions "ISO 3166-2:CV" and explains it is the entry for Cabo Verde. This directly matches the reasoning step and is highly relevant.  
- **Context 11**: Provides detailed information about Cabo Verde, including its location in the central Atlantic Ocean. This is highly relevant to the claim and reasoning steps.  
- **Context 9, 0, 18, 1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 4, 15, 14**: These contexts discuss ISO codes for other countries (e.g., Bhutan, Comoros, Brazil) and are not relevant to the claim or reasoning steps.  

### Ranking:  
1. **Context 13**: Directly mentions "ISO 3166-2:CV" and links it to Cabo Verde.  
2. **Context 11**: Provides detailed information about Cabo Verde, including its location in the central Atlantic Ocean.  
3-8. Remaining contexts are not relevant to the claim or reasoning steps and will not be included in the top 8.  

# idx: [13, 11]

# step-by-step think: 
To rank the contexts, I will evaluate them based on their relevance to the claim and reasoning steps: 

1. **Match with "ISO 3166-2:CV >> country >>>> Cabo Verde"**  
   - Title or content explicitly mentioning "ISO 3166-2:CV" or "Cabo Verde" will score higher.
   - Contexts discussing ISO code standards for Cabo Verde are paramount.

2. **Match with "Where is Cabo Verde located? >>>> central Atlantic Ocean"**  
   - Content describing the geographical location of Cabo Verde, such as references to it being in the central Atlantic Ocean, will also be highly relevant.

3. **Likelihood of Containing the Answer**  
   - Priority will be given to contexts that both connect ISO 3166-2:CV to Cabo Verde and provide geographical information about Cabo Verde.  

4. **Irrelevant ISO 3166 codes (those not linked to Cabo Verde) or discussions unrelated to the geographic location of Cabo Verde will be deprioritized**.

Ranking the contexts:  
- **Context 13** explicitly identifies "ISO 3166-2:CV" as the code for Cabo Verde. This matches the first reasoning step precisely.  
- **Context 11** provides a detailed geographical description of where Cabo Verde is located, directly answering the second reasoning step.  
- Remaining contexts such as 0, 9, 18, etc., mention unrelated ISO 3166 codes (e.g., Bhutan, Comoros) and are thus much less relevant.  

Finally, the prioritization reflects alignment with entities mentioned in reasoning steps and claim relevance.

1. Identify the entities and relationships in the reasoning steps: Assomada, Cabo Verde, central Atlantic Ocean, and their associations.
2. Analyze the relevance of each context's title and paragraph_text to these entities and relationships.
3. Prioritize contexts mentioning "Cabo Verde," "Cape Verde," "Atlantic Ocean," or highly related concepts to the claim and reasoning steps.
4. Evaluate each context's informativeness to determine if it explains the location of Cabo Verde or Assomada specifically.
5. Rank the contexts by combining relevance, informativeness, and likelihood of containing the answer.
6. Select the top 16 ranked contexts based on the overall assessment.

# Step-by-step think: To rank the given contexts, I will evaluate each based on the following criteria: 

1. **Match with reasoning steps**: I will identify contexts whose titles or paragraph_text explicitly overlap with entities or relationships in the reasoning steps, such as "Assomada", "Cabo Verde", or "central Atlantic Ocean". Stronger matches will rank higher. 
2. **Relevance to the claim**: I will prioritize contexts that are directly related to the claim ("Where is Assomada located?") and provide geographic or location-based information. 
3. **Likelihood of containing the answer**: Contexts more likely to provide specific geographic information about Assomada's location will be ranked higher.

Now, let's analyze:

- Context **11** discusses Cabo Verde ("an island country spanning an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the central Atlantic Ocean"), perfectly matching the reasoning step about Cabo Verde's location. It is central to the claim and likely contains the answer.
- Context **4** mentions "Cape Verde" within a broader discussion but is less informative about geographic details or relevant to locating Assomada.
- Contexts **13, 15, and 17** refer to towns in different parts of Spain (the Basque Country) and are unrelated to Assomada or Cabo Verde.
- Context **14** is about a Canadian town with no relevance to the claim or reasoning steps.
- Context **6** talks about Africa and development indices, but it lacks direct connections to Cabo Verde or Assomada.
- Contexts **8 and 19** describe islands in Tonga and are not related to Cabo Verde or Assomada.
- Context **1** discusses the Congo, which is unrelated to the claim.
- Contexts **7 and 10** discuss Subway restaurants in various countries, none relevant to the claim.
- Contexts **2**, **3**, **5**, and **16** describe unrelated locations or establishments.

# step-by-step think:
1. Context with idx 11: The context discusses Cabo Verde, its location in the central Atlantic Ocean, and includes geographical details about the nation. It directly matches the reasoning steps, especially the step "Where is Cabo Verde located?" and is most likely to contain relevant information to address the claim about Assomada's location since it is an island country in Cabo Verde.
2. Context with idx 4: Although this context refers to RTC (Cape Verde), it contains less relevant information about Cabo Verde's geographical location or its relationship with Assomada. The mention of RTC as a broadcasting platform does not align well with the reasoning steps or the claim.
3. Context with idx 6: This context discusses HDI of African countries collectively and mentions Africa. However, it does not provide specific details about Cabo Verde or its geographic location. It has limited relevance to the claim and the reasoning steps.
4. Context with idx 1, 8, 19, 13, and 15: These contexts refer to locations unrelated to Cabo Verde or Assomada. They do not align with the reasoning steps or mention the key entities (Cabo Verde, Assomada, or the central Atlantic Ocean) that are directly relevant to the claim.

# idx: [11, 4, 6, 1]

# step-by-step think:
1. Context with idx 11 (Cape Verde) directly mentions "Cabo Verde," which is explicitly stated in the reasoning steps as the country associated with Assomada, and it includes details about its geographical location in the central Atlantic Ocean. It is highly relevant and likely to contain the answer.
2. Context with idx 4 (RTC (Cape Verde)) references "Cape Verde" in its discussion of broadcasting services. While it refers to the country, it is less geographically descriptive compared to idx 11. It is moderately relevant but less likely to directly address the claim.
3. Context with idx 1 (Republic of the Congo) discusses the location of Brazzaville in Congo, which is unrelated to the reasoning steps involving Cabo Verde or Assomada. It is irrelevant to the claim.
4. Context with idx 6 (Human Development Index) provides information about development statistics in Africa. While geographically involving Africa, it lacks explicit references to Cabo Verde, Assomada, or the reasoning steps. It is less relevant.

step-by-step think:The claim mentions the "1972 Federation Cup" and asks what it is named after. The reasoning steps state that the 1972 Federation Cup is an instance of Fed Cup and asks what Fed Cup is named after, which is the International Tennis Federation (ITF). We need to rank the contexts based on their relevance to the reasoning steps and their likelihood of containing the answer.

1. Title Match: We should check if the title of each context matches the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. We should give higher scores to the contexts with matching titles. 
2. Paragraph Match: If the title doesn't match, we should check if the text of the paragraph contains the entities or relationships in the reasoning steps. We should again give higher scores to the contexts with matching content. 
3. Relevance to Claim: We need to assess how relevant each context is to the claim itself. If a context mentions the 1972 Federation Cup or the Fed Cup, it is likely to be more relevant and should receive a higher score. 
4. Likelihood of Containing the Answer: If a context explicitly mentions that it is named after something or if it mentions the International Tennis Federation, it is more likely to contain the answer and should receive a higher score.

Based on these rules, we can now score each context and rank them in order of their scores.
